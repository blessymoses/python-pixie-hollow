.. py:class:: IoTEventsData.Client

  A low-level client representing AWS IoT Events Data
  

  IoT Events monitors your equipment or device fleets for failures or changes in operation, and triggers actions when such events occur. You can use IoT Events Data API commands to send inputs to detectors, list detectors, and view or update a detector's status.

   

  For more information, see `What is IoT Events? <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iotevents/latest/developerguide/what-is-iotevents.html>`__ in the *IoT Events Developer Guide*.
