.. py:method:: SageMakerRuntime.Client.invoke_endpoint(**kwargs)

  

  After you deploy a model into production using Amazon SageMaker AI hosting services, your client applications use this API to get inferences from the model hosted at the specified endpoint.

   

  For an overview of Amazon SageMaker AI, see `How It Works <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/how-it-works.html>`__.

   

  Amazon SageMaker AI strips all POST headers except those supported by the API. Amazon SageMaker AI might add additional headers. You should not rely on the behavior of headers outside those enumerated in the request syntax.

   

  Calls to ``InvokeEndpoint`` are authenticated by using Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4. For information, see `Authenticating Requests (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 API Reference*.

   

  A customer's model containers must respond to requests within 60 seconds. The model itself can have a maximum processing time of 60 seconds before responding to invocations. If your model is going to take 50-60 seconds of processing time, the SDK socket timeout should be set to be 70 seconds.

   

  .. note::

    

    Endpoints are scoped to an individual account, and are not public. The URL does not contain the account ID, but Amazon SageMaker AI determines the account ID from the authentication token that is supplied by the caller.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.invoke_endpoint(
        EndpointName='string',
        Body=b'bytes'|file,
        ContentType='string',
        Accept='string',
        CustomAttributes='string',
        TargetModel='string',
        TargetVariant='string',
        TargetContainerHostname='string',
        InferenceId='string',
        EnableExplanations='string',
        InferenceComponentName='string',
        SessionId='string'
    )
    
  :type EndpointName: string
  :param EndpointName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of the endpoint that you specified when you created the endpoint using the `CreateEndpoint <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/API_CreateEndpoint.html>`__ API.

    

  
  :type Body: bytes or seekable file-like object
  :param Body: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Provides input data, in the format specified in the ``ContentType`` request header. Amazon SageMaker AI passes all of the data in the body to the model.

     

    For information about the format of the request body, see `Common Data Formats-Inference <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/cdf-inference.html>`__.

    

  
  :type ContentType: string
  :param ContentType: 

    The MIME type of the input data in the request body.

    

  
  :type Accept: string
  :param Accept: 

    The desired MIME type of the inference response from the model container.

    

  
  :type CustomAttributes: string
  :param CustomAttributes: 

    Provides additional information about a request for an inference submitted to a model hosted at an Amazon SageMaker AI endpoint. The information is an opaque value that is forwarded verbatim. You could use this value, for example, to provide an ID that you can use to track a request or to provide other metadata that a service endpoint was programmed to process. The value must consist of no more than 1024 visible US-ASCII characters as specified in `Section 3.3.6. Field Value Components <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7230#section-3.2.6>`__ of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1).

     

    The code in your model is responsible for setting or updating any custom attributes in the response. If your code does not set this value in the response, an empty value is returned. For example, if a custom attribute represents the trace ID, your model can prepend the custom attribute with ``Trace ID:`` in your post-processing function.

     

    This feature is currently supported in the Amazon Web Services SDKs but not in the Amazon SageMaker AI Python SDK.

    

  
  :type TargetModel: string
  :param TargetModel: 

    The model to request for inference when invoking a multi-model endpoint.

    

  
  :type TargetVariant: string
  :param TargetVariant: 

    Specify the production variant to send the inference request to when invoking an endpoint that is running two or more variants. Note that this parameter overrides the default behavior for the endpoint, which is to distribute the invocation traffic based on the variant weights.

     

    For information about how to use variant targeting to perform a/b testing, see `Test models in production <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-ab-testing.html>`__

    

  
  :type TargetContainerHostname: string
  :param TargetContainerHostname: 

    If the endpoint hosts multiple containers and is configured to use direct invocation, this parameter specifies the host name of the container to invoke.

    

  
  :type InferenceId: string
  :param InferenceId: 

    If you provide a value, it is added to the captured data when you enable data capture on the endpoint. For information about data capture, see `Capture Data <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-monitor-data-capture.html>`__.

    

  
  :type EnableExplanations: string
  :param EnableExplanations: 

    An optional JMESPath expression used to override the ``EnableExplanations`` parameter of the ``ClarifyExplainerConfig`` API. See the `EnableExplanations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/clarify-online-explainability-create-endpoint.html#clarify-online-explainability-create-endpoint-enable>`__ section in the developer guide for more information.

    

  
  :type InferenceComponentName: string
  :param InferenceComponentName: 

    If the endpoint hosts one or more inference components, this parameter specifies the name of inference component to invoke.

    

  
  :type SessionId: string
  :param SessionId: 

    Creates a stateful session or identifies an existing one. You can do one of the following:

     

    
    * Create a stateful session by specifying the value ``NEW_SESSION``.
     
    * Send your request to an existing stateful session by specifying the ID of that session.
    

     

    With a stateful session, you can send multiple requests to a stateful model. When you create a session with a stateful model, the model must create the session ID and set the expiration time. The model must also provide that information in the response to your request. You can get the ID and timestamp from the ``NewSessionId`` response parameter. For any subsequent request where you specify that session ID, SageMaker AI routes the request to the same instance that supports the session.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **Body** (:class:`.StreamingBody`) -- 

        Includes the inference provided by the model.

         

        For information about the format of the response body, see `Common Data Formats-Inference <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/cdf-inference.html>`__.

         

        If the explainer is activated, the body includes the explanations provided by the model. For more information, see the **Response section** under `Invoke the Endpoint <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/clarify-online-explainability-invoke-endpoint.html#clarify-online-explainability-response>`__ in the Developer Guide.

        
      

      - **ContentType** *(string) --* 

        The MIME type of the inference returned from the model container.

        
      

      - **InvokedProductionVariant** *(string) --* 

        Identifies the production variant that was invoked.

        
      

      - **CustomAttributes** *(string) --* 

        Provides additional information in the response about the inference returned by a model hosted at an Amazon SageMaker AI endpoint. The information is an opaque value that is forwarded verbatim. You could use this value, for example, to return an ID received in the ``CustomAttributes`` header of a request or other metadata that a service endpoint was programmed to produce. The value must consist of no more than 1024 visible US-ASCII characters as specified in `Section 3.3.6. Field Value Components <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.2.6>`__ of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1). If the customer wants the custom attribute returned, the model must set the custom attribute to be included on the way back.

         

        The code in your model is responsible for setting or updating any custom attributes in the response. If your code does not set this value in the response, an empty value is returned. For example, if a custom attribute represents the trace ID, your model can prepend the custom attribute with ``Trace ID:`` in your post-processing function.

         

        This feature is currently supported in the Amazon Web Services SDKs but not in the Amazon SageMaker AI Python SDK.

        
      

      - **NewSessionId** *(string) --* 

        If you created a stateful session with your request, the ID and expiration time that the model assigns to that session.

        
      

      - **ClosedSessionId** *(string) --* 

        If you closed a stateful session with your request, the ID of that session.
