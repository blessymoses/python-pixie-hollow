    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **insights** *(dict) --* 

        The assessment analytics data that the ``GetInsightsByAssessment`` API returned.

        
        

        - **noncompliantEvidenceCount** *(integer) --* 

          The number of compliance check evidence that Audit Manager classified as non-compliant. This includes evidence that was collected from Security Hub with a *Fail* ruling, or collected from Config with a *Non-compliant* ruling.

          
        

        - **compliantEvidenceCount** *(integer) --* 

          The number of compliance check evidence that Audit Manager classified as compliant. This includes evidence that was collected from Security Hub with a *Pass* ruling, or collected from Config with a *Compliant* ruling.

          
        

        - **inconclusiveEvidenceCount** *(integer) --* 

          The amount of evidence without a compliance check ruling. Evidence is inconclusive if the associated control uses Security Hub or Config as a data source and you didn't enable those services. This is also the case if a control uses a data source that doesn’t support compliance checks (for example, manual evidence, API calls, or CloudTrail).

           

          .. note::

            

            If evidence has a compliance check status of *not applicable*, it's classified as *inconclusive* in ``InsightsByAssessment`` data.

            

          
        

        - **assessmentControlsCountByNoncompliantEvidence** *(integer) --* 

          The number of assessment controls that collected non-compliant evidence on the ``lastUpdated`` date.

          
        

        - **totalAssessmentControlsCount** *(integer) --* 

          The total number of controls in the assessment.

          
        

        - **lastUpdated** *(datetime) --* 

          The time when the assessment insights were last updated.
