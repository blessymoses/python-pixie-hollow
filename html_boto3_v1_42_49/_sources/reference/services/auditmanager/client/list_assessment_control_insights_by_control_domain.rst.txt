.. py:method:: AuditManager.Client.list_assessment_control_insights_by_control_domain(**kwargs)

  

  Lists the latest analytics data for controls within a specific control domain and a specific active assessment.

   

  .. note::

    

    Control insights are listed only if the control belongs to the control domain and assessment that was specified. Moreover, the control must have collected evidence on the ``lastUpdated`` date of ``controlInsightsByAssessment``. If neither of these conditions are met, no data is listed for that control.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **controlInsightsByAssessment** *(list) --* 

        The assessment control analytics data that the ``ListAssessmentControlInsightsByControlDomain`` API returned.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          A summary of the latest analytics data for a specific control in a specific active assessment.

           

          Control insights are grouped by control domain, and ranked by the highest total count of non-compliant evidence.

          
          

          - **name** *(string) --* 

            The name of the assessment control.

            
          

          - **id** *(string) --* 

            The unique identifier for the assessment control.

            
          

          - **evidenceInsights** *(dict) --* 

            A breakdown of the compliance check status for the evidence that’s associated with the assessment control.

            
            

            - **noncompliantEvidenceCount** *(integer) --* 

              The number of compliance check evidence that Audit Manager classified as non-compliant. This includes evidence that was collected from Security Hub with a *Fail* ruling, or collected from Config with a *Non-compliant* ruling.

              
            

            - **compliantEvidenceCount** *(integer) --* 

              The number of compliance check evidence that Audit Manager classified as compliant. This includes evidence that was collected from Security Hub with a *Pass* ruling, or collected from Config with a *Compliant* ruling.

              
            

            - **inconclusiveEvidenceCount** *(integer) --* 

              The number of evidence that a compliance check ruling isn't available for. Evidence is inconclusive when the associated control uses Security Hub or Config as a data source but you didn't enable those services. This is also the case when a control uses a data source that doesn’t support compliance checks (for example, manual evidence, API calls, or CloudTrail).

               

              .. note::

                

                If evidence has a compliance check status of *not applicable* in the console, it's classified as *inconclusive* in ``EvidenceInsights`` data.

                

              
        
          

          - **controlSetName** *(string) --* 

            The name of the control set that the assessment control belongs to.

            
          

          - **lastUpdated** *(datetime) --* 

            The time when the assessment control insights were last updated.

            
      
    
      

      - **nextToken** *(string) --* 

        The pagination token that's used to fetch the next set of results.
