.. py:method:: AuditManager.Client.list_control_insights_by_control_domain(**kwargs)

  

  Lists the latest analytics data for controls within a specific control domain across all active assessments.

   

  .. note::

    

    Control insights are listed only if the control belongs to the control domain that was specified and the control collected evidence on the ``lastUpdated`` date of ``controlInsightsMetadata``. If neither of these conditions are met, no data is listed for that control.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **controlInsightsMetadata** *(list) --* 

        The control analytics data that the ``ListControlInsightsByControlDomain`` API returned.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          A summary of the latest analytics data for a specific control.

           

          This data reflects the total counts for the specified control across all active assessments. Control insights are grouped by control domain, and ranked by the highest total count of non-compliant evidence.

          
          

          - **name** *(string) --* 

            The name of the control.

            
          

          - **id** *(string) --* 

            The unique identifier for the control.

            
          

          - **evidenceInsights** *(dict) --* 

            A breakdown of the compliance check status for the evidence that’s associated with the control.

            
            

            - **noncompliantEvidenceCount** *(integer) --* 

              The number of compliance check evidence that Audit Manager classified as non-compliant. This includes evidence that was collected from Security Hub with a *Fail* ruling, or collected from Config with a *Non-compliant* ruling.

              
            

            - **compliantEvidenceCount** *(integer) --* 

              The number of compliance check evidence that Audit Manager classified as compliant. This includes evidence that was collected from Security Hub with a *Pass* ruling, or collected from Config with a *Compliant* ruling.

              
            

            - **inconclusiveEvidenceCount** *(integer) --* 

              The number of evidence that a compliance check ruling isn't available for. Evidence is inconclusive when the associated control uses Security Hub or Config as a data source but you didn't enable those services. This is also the case when a control uses a data source that doesn’t support compliance checks (for example, manual evidence, API calls, or CloudTrail).

               

              .. note::

                

                If evidence has a compliance check status of *not applicable* in the console, it's classified as *inconclusive* in ``EvidenceInsights`` data.

                

              
        
          

          - **lastUpdated** *(datetime) --* 

            The time when the control insights were last updated.

            
      
    
      

      - **nextToken** *(string) --* 

        The pagination token that's used to fetch the next set of results.
