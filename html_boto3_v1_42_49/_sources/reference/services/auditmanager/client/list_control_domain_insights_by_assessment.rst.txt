.. py:method:: AuditManager.Client.list_control_domain_insights_by_assessment(**kwargs)

  

  Lists analytics data for control domains within a specified active assessment.

   

  Audit Manager supports the control domains that are provided by Amazon Web Services Control Catalog. For information about how to find a list of available control domains, see `ListDomains <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controlcatalog/latest/APIReference/API_ListDomains.html>`__ in the Amazon Web Services Control Catalog API Reference.

   

  .. note::

    

    A control domain is listed only if at least one of the controls within that domain collected evidence on the ``lastUpdated`` date of ``controlDomainInsights``. If this condition isn’t met, no data is listed for that domain.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **controlDomainInsights** *(list) --* 

        The control domain analytics data that the ``ListControlDomainInsightsByAssessment`` API returned.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          A summary of the latest analytics data for a specific control domain.

           

          Control domain insights are grouped by control domain, and ranked by the highest total count of non-compliant evidence.

          
          

          - **name** *(string) --* 

            The name of the control domain.

            
          

          - **id** *(string) --* 

            The unique identifier for the control domain. Audit Manager supports the control domains that are provided by Amazon Web Services Control Catalog. For information about how to find a list of available control domains, see `ListDomains <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controlcatalog/latest/APIReference/API_ListDomains.html>`__ in the Amazon Web Services Control Catalog API Reference.

            
          

          - **controlsCountByNoncompliantEvidence** *(integer) --* 

            The number of controls in the control domain that collected non-compliant evidence on the ``lastUpdated`` date.

            
          

          - **totalControlsCount** *(integer) --* 

            The total number of controls in the control domain.

            
          

          - **evidenceInsights** *(dict) --* 

            A breakdown of the compliance check status for the evidence that’s associated with the control domain.

            
            

            - **noncompliantEvidenceCount** *(integer) --* 

              The number of compliance check evidence that Audit Manager classified as non-compliant. This includes evidence that was collected from Security Hub with a *Fail* ruling, or collected from Config with a *Non-compliant* ruling.

              
            

            - **compliantEvidenceCount** *(integer) --* 

              The number of compliance check evidence that Audit Manager classified as compliant. This includes evidence that was collected from Security Hub with a *Pass* ruling, or collected from Config with a *Compliant* ruling.

              
            

            - **inconclusiveEvidenceCount** *(integer) --* 

              The number of evidence that a compliance check ruling isn't available for. Evidence is inconclusive when the associated control uses Security Hub or Config as a data source but you didn't enable those services. This is also the case when a control uses a data source that doesn’t support compliance checks (for example, manual evidence, API calls, or CloudTrail).

               

              .. note::

                

                If evidence has a compliance check status of *not applicable* in the console, it's classified as *inconclusive* in ``EvidenceInsights`` data.

                

              
        
          

          - **lastUpdated** *(datetime) --* 

            The time when the control domain insights were last updated.

            
      
    
      

      - **nextToken** *(string) --* 

        The pagination token that's used to fetch the next set of results.
