.. py:method:: AuditManager.Client.get_services_in_scope()

  

  Gets a list of the Amazon Web Services services from which Audit Manager can collect evidence.

   

  Audit Manager defines which Amazon Web Services services are in scope for an assessment. Audit Manager infers this scope by examining the assessment’s controls and their data sources, and then mapping this information to one or more of the corresponding Amazon Web Services services that are in this list.

   

  .. note::

    

    For information about why it's no longer possible to specify services in scope manually, see `I can't edit the services in scope for my assessment <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/evidence-collection-issues.html#unable-to-edit-services>`__ in the *Troubleshooting* section of the Audit Manager user guide.
