.. py:method:: GameLift.Client.create_game_session_queue(**kwargs)

  

  **This API works with the following fleet types:** EC2, Anywhere, Container

   

  Creates a placement queue that processes requests for new game sessions. A queue uses FleetIQ algorithms to locate the best available placement locations for a new game session, and then prompts the game server process to start a new game session.

   

  A game session queue is configured with a set of destinations (Amazon GameLift Servers fleets or aliases) that determine where the queue can place new game sessions. These destinations can span multiple Amazon Web Services Regions, can use different instance types, and can include both Spot and On-Demand fleets. If the queue includes multi-location fleets, the queue can place game sessions in any of a fleet's remote locations.

   

  You can configure a queue to determine how it selects the best available placement for a new game session. Queues can prioritize placement decisions based on a combination of location, hosting cost, and player latency. You can set up the queue to use the default prioritization or provide alternate instructions using ``PriorityConfiguration``.

   

  **Request options**

   

  Use this operation to make these common types of requests.

   

  
  * Create a queue with the minimum required parameters. 

    
    * ``Name``
     
    * ``Destinations`` (This parameter isn't required, but a queue can't make placements without at least one destination.)
    

  
   
  * Create a queue with placement notification. Queues that have high placement activity must use a notification system, such as with Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) or Amazon CloudWatch. 

    
    * Required parameters ``Name`` and ``Destinations``
     
    * ``NotificationTarget``
    

  
   
  * Create a queue with custom prioritization settings. These custom settings replace the default prioritization configuration for a queue. 

    
    * Required parameters ``Name`` and ``Destinations``
     
    * ``PriorityConfiguration``
    

  
   
  * Create a queue with special rules for processing player latency data. 

    
    * Required parameters ``Name`` and ``Destinations``
     
    * ``PlayerLatencyPolicies``
    

  
  

   

  **Results**

   

  If successful, this operation returns a new ``GameSessionQueue`` object with an assigned queue ARN. Use the queue's name or ARN when submitting new game session requests with `StartGameSessionPlacement <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_StartGameSessionPlacement.html>`__ or `StartMatchmaking <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_StartMatchmaking.html>`__.

  :type Name: string
  :param Name: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A descriptive label that is associated with game session queue. Queue names must be unique within each Region.

    

  
  :type TimeoutInSeconds: integer
  :param TimeoutInSeconds: 

    The maximum time, in seconds, that a new game session placement request remains in the queue. When a request exceeds this time, the game session placement changes to a ``TIMED_OUT`` status. If you don't specify a request timeout, the queue uses a default value.

     

    .. note::

      

      The minimum value is 10 and the maximum value is 600.

      

    

  
  :type PlayerLatencyPolicies: list
  :param PlayerLatencyPolicies: 

    A set of policies that enforce a sliding cap on player latency when processing game sessions placement requests. Use multiple policies to gradually relax the cap over time if Amazon GameLift Servers can't make a placement. Policies are evaluated in order starting with the lowest maximum latency value.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      Sets a latency cap for individual players when placing a game session. With a latency policy in force, a game session cannot be placed in a fleet location where a player reports latency higher than the cap. Latency policies are used only with placement request that provide player latency information. Player latency policies can be stacked to gradually relax latency requirements over time.

      - **PolicyDurationSeconds** *(integer) --* 

        The length of time, in seconds, that the policy is enforced while placing a new game session. A null value for this property means that the policy is enforced until the queue times out.

    - **PriorityOrder** *(list) --* 

      A custom sequence to use when prioritizing where to place new game sessions. Each priority type is listed once.
