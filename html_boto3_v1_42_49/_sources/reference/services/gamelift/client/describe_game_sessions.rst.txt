.. py:method:: GameLift.Client.describe_game_sessions(**kwargs)

  

  **This API works with the following fleet types:** EC2, Anywhere, Container

   

  Retrieves a set of one or more game sessions in a specific fleet location. You can optionally filter the results by current game session status.

   

  This operation can be used in the following ways:

   

  
  * To retrieve all game sessions that are currently running on all locations in a fleet, provide a fleet or alias ID, with an optional status filter. This approach returns all game sessions in the fleet's home Region and all remote locations.
   
  * To retrieve all game sessions that are currently running on a specific fleet location, provide a fleet or alias ID and a location name, with optional status filter. The location can be the fleet's home Region or any remote location.
   
  * To retrieve a specific game session, provide the game session ID. This approach looks for the game session ID in all fleets that reside in the Amazon Web Services Region defined in the request.
  

   

  Use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages.

   

  If successful, a ``GameSession`` object is returned for each game session that matches the request.

   

  This operation is not designed to be continually called to track game session status. This practice can cause you to exceed your API limit, which results in errors. Instead, you must configure an Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) topic to receive notifications from FlexMatch or queues. Continuously polling with ``DescribeGameSessions`` should only be used for games in development with low game session usage.

   

  *Available in Amazon GameLift Servers Local.*

            * ``TRIGGERED_ON_PROCESS_TERMINATE`` – The game session was stopped by calling ``TerminateGameSession`` with the termination mode ``TRIGGER_ON_PROCESS_TERMINATE``.
             
            * ``FORCE_TERMINATED`` – The game session was stopped by calling ``TerminateGameSession`` with the termination mode ``FORCE_TERMINATE``.
            

            
          

          - **GameProperties** *(list) --* 

            A set of key-value pairs that can store custom data in a game session. For example: ``{"Key": "difficulty", "Value": "novice"}``.

             

            .. note::

              

              Avoid using periods (".") in property keys if you plan to search for game sessions by properties. Property keys containing periods cannot be searched and will be filtered out from search results due to search index limitations.

              

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

              This key-value pair can store custom data about a game session. For example, you might use a ``GameProperty`` to track a game session's map, level of difficulty, or remaining time. The difficulty level could be specified like this: ``{"Key": "difficulty", "Value":"Novice"}``.

               

              You can set game properties when creating a game session. You can also modify game properties of an active game session. When searching for game sessions, you can filter on game property keys and values. You can't delete game properties from a game session.

               

              For examples of working with game properties, see `Create a game session with properties <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-client-api.html#game-properties>`__.

              
              

              - **Key** *(string) --* 

                The game property identifier.

                 

                .. note::

                  

                  Avoid using periods (".") in property keys if you plan to search for game sessions by properties. Property keys containing periods cannot be searched and will be filtered out from search results due to search index limitations.

                  

                
              

              - **Value** *(string) --* 

                The game property value.

                
          
        
          

          - **IpAddress** *(string) --* 

            The IP address of the game session. To connect to a Amazon GameLift Servers game server, an app needs both the IP address and port number.

            
          

          - **DnsName** *(string) --* 

            The DNS identifier assigned to the instance that is running the game session. Values have the following format:

             

            
            * TLS-enabled fleets: ``<unique identifier>.<region identifier>.amazongamelift.com``.
             
            * Non-TLS-enabled fleets: ``ec2-<unique identifier>.compute.amazonaws.com``. (See `Amazon EC2 Instance IP Addressing <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-instance-addressing.html#concepts-public-addresses>`__.)
            

             

            When connecting to a game session that is running on a TLS-enabled fleet, you must use the DNS name, not the IP address.

            
          

          - **Port** *(integer) --* 

            The port number for the game session. To connect to a Amazon GameLift Servers game server, an app needs both the IP address and port number.

            
          

          - **PlayerSessionCreationPolicy** *(string) --* 

            Indicates whether the game session is accepting new players.

            
          

          - **CreatorId** *(string) --* 

            A unique identifier for a player. This ID is used to enforce a resource protection policy (if one exists), that limits the number of game sessions a player can create.

            
          

          - **GameSessionData** *(string) --* 

            A set of custom game session properties, formatted as a single string value. This data is passed to a game server process with a request to start a new game session. For more information, see `Start a game session <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-server-api.html#gamelift-sdk-server-startsession>`__.

            
          

          - **MatchmakerData** *(string) --* 

            Information about the matchmaking process that resulted in the game session, if matchmaking was used. Data is in JSON syntax, formatted as a string. Information includes the matchmaker ID as well as player attributes and team assignments. For more details on matchmaker data, see `Match Data <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/flexmatchguide/match-server.html#match-server-data>`__. Matchmaker data is updated whenever new players are added during a successful backfill (see `StartMatchBackfill <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_StartMatchBackfill.html>`__).

            
          

          - **Location** *(string) --* 

            The fleet location where the game session is running. This value might specify the fleet's home Region or a remote location. Location is expressed as an Amazon Web Services Region code such as ``us-west-2``.

            
      
    
      

      - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

        A token that indicates where to resume retrieving results on the next call to this operation. If no token is returned, these results represent the end of the list.
