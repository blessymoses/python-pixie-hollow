.. py:method:: GameLift.Client.stop_game_session_placement(**kwargs)

  

  **This API works with the following fleet types:** EC2, Anywhere, Container

   

  Cancels a game session placement that's in ``PENDING`` status. To stop a placement, provide the placement ID value.

   

  Results

   

  If successful, this operation removes the placement request from the queue and moves the ``GameSessionPlacement`` to ``CANCELLED`` status.

   

  This operation results in an ``InvalidRequestExecption`` (400) error if a game session has already been created for this placement. You can clean up an unneeded game session by calling `TerminateGameSession <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_TerminateGameSession>`__.

          * **FAILED** -- Amazon GameLift Servers is not able to complete the process of placing the game session. Common reasons are the game session terminated before the placement process was completed, or an unexpected internal error.
          

          
        

        - **GameProperties** *(list) --* 

          A set of key-value pairs that can store custom data in a game session. For example: ``{"Key": "difficulty", "Value": "novice"}``.

           

          .. note::

            

            Avoid using periods (".") in property keys if you plan to search for game sessions by properties. Property keys containing periods cannot be searched and will be filtered out from search results due to search index limitations.

            

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            This key-value pair can store custom data about a game session. For example, you might use a ``GameProperty`` to track a game session's map, level of difficulty, or remaining time. The difficulty level could be specified like this: ``{"Key": "difficulty", "Value":"Novice"}``.

             

            You can set game properties when creating a game session. You can also modify game properties of an active game session. When searching for game sessions, you can filter on game property keys and values. You can't delete game properties from a game session.

             

            For examples of working with game properties, see `Create a game session with properties <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-client-api.html#game-properties>`__.

          When connecting to a game session that is running on a TLS-enabled fleet, you must use the DNS name, not the IP address.

          
        

        - **Port** *(integer) --* 

          The port number for the game session. To connect to a Amazon GameLift Servers game server, an app needs both the IP address and port number. This value isn't final until placement status is ``FULFILLED``.

          
        

        - **PlacedPlayerSessions** *(list) --*

            - **PlayerSessionId** *(string) --* 

              A unique identifier for a player session.

              
        
      
        

        - **GameSessionData** *(string) --* 

          A set of custom game session properties, formatted as a single string value. This data is passed to a game server process with a request to start a new game session. For more information, see `Start a game session <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-server-api.html#gamelift-sdk-server-startsession>`__.

        - **PriorityConfigurationOverride** *(dict) --* 

          An alternative priority list of locations that's included with a game session placement request. When provided, the list overrides a queue's location order list for this game session placement request only. The list might include Amazon Web Services Regions, local zones, and custom locations (for Anywhere fleets). The fallback strategy tells Amazon GameLift Servers what action to take (if any) in the event that it failed to place a new game session.

          
          

          - **PlacementFallbackStrategy** *(string) --* 

            Instructions for how to proceed if placement fails in every location on the priority override list. Valid strategies include:

             

            
            * ``DEFAULT_AFTER_SINGLE_PASS`` -- After attempting to place a new game session in every location on the priority override list, try to place a game session in queue's other locations. This is the default behavior.
             
            * ``NONE`` -- Limit placements to locations on the priority override list only.
            

            
          

          - **LocationOrder** *(list) --* 

            A prioritized list of hosting locations. The list can include Amazon Web Services Regions (such as ``us-west-2``), local zones, and custom locations (for Anywhere fleets). Each location must be listed only once. For details, see `Amazon GameLift Servers service locations. <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-regions.html>`__
