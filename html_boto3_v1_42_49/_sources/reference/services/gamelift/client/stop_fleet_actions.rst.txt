.. py:method:: GameLift.Client.stop_fleet_actions(**kwargs)

  

  **This API works with the following fleet types:** EC2, Container

   

  Suspends certain types of activity in a fleet location. Currently, this operation is used to stop auto-scaling activity. For multi-location fleets, fleet actions are managed separately for each location.

   

  Stopping fleet actions has several potential purposes. It allows you to temporarily stop auto-scaling activity but retain your scaling policies for use in the future. For multi-location fleets, you can set up fleet-wide auto-scaling, and then opt out of it for certain locations.

   

  This operation can be used in the following ways:

   

  
  * To stop actions on instances in the fleet's home Region, provide a fleet ID and the type of actions to suspend.
   
  * To stop actions on instances in one of the fleet's remote locations, provide a fleet ID, a location name, and the type of actions to suspend.
  

   

  If successful, Amazon GameLift Servers no longer initiates scaling events except in response to manual changes using `UpdateFleetCapacity <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_UpdateFleetCapacity.html>`__. To restart fleet actions again, call `StartFleetActions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_StartFleetActions.html>`__.
