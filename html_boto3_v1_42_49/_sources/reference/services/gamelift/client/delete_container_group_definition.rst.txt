  **Request options:**

   

  Deletes a container group definition.

   

  
  * Delete an entire container group definition, including all versions. Specify the container group definition name, or use an ARN value without the version number.
   
  * Delete a particular version. Specify the container group definition name and a version number, or use an ARN value that includes the version number.
   
  * Keep the newest versions and delete all older versions. Specify the container group definition name and the number of versions to retain. For example, set ``VersionCountToRetain`` to 5 to delete all but the five most recent versions.

  * If the version is being used in an active fleet
   
  * If the version is being deployed to a fleet in a deployment that's currently in progress.
   
  * If the version is designated as a rollback definition in a fleet deployment that's currently in progress.
