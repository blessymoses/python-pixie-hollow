.. py:method:: GameLift.Client.create_player_session(**kwargs)

  

  **This API works with the following fleet types:** EC2, Anywhere, Container

   

  Reserves an open player slot in a game session for a player. New player sessions can be created in any game session with an open slot that is in ``ACTIVE`` status and has a player creation policy of ``ACCEPT_ALL``. You can add a group of players to a game session with `CreatePlayerSessions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_CreatePlayerSessions.html>`__ .

   

  To create a player session, specify a game session ID, player ID, and optionally a set of player data.

   

  If successful, a slot is reserved in the game session for the player and a new ``PlayerSessions`` object is returned with a player session ID. The player references the player session ID when sending a connection request to the game session, and the game server can use it to validate the player reservation with the Amazon GameLift Servers service. Player sessions cannot be updated.

   

  The maximum number of players per game session is 200. It is not adjustable.

    A unique identifier for a player. Player IDs are developer-defined.

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **PlayerSession** *(dict) --* 

        Object that describes the newly created player session record.

        
        

        - **PlayerSessionId** *(string) --*

        - **GameSessionId** *(string) --* 

          A unique identifier for the game session that the player session is connected to.

          
        

        - **FleetId** *(string) --* 

          A unique identifier for the fleet that the player's game session is running on.

          
        

        - **FleetArn** *(string) --* 

          The Amazon Resource Name ( `ARN <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-arn-format.html>`__) associated with the GameLift fleet that the player's game session is running on.

          
        

        - **CreationTime** *(datetime) --* 

          A time stamp indicating when this data object was created. Format is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for example ``"1469498468.057"``).

          
        

        - **TerminationTime** *(datetime) --* 

          A time stamp indicating when this data object was terminated. Format is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for example ``"1469498468.057"``).

          
        

        - **Status** *(string) --* 

          Current status of the player session.

           

          Possible player session statuses include the following:

           

          
          * **RESERVED** -- The player session request has been received, but the player has not yet connected to the server process and/or been validated.
           
          * **ACTIVE** -- The player has been validated by the server process and is currently connected.
           
          * **COMPLETED** -- The player connection has been dropped.
           
          * **TIMEDOUT** -- A player session request was received, but the player did not connect and/or was not validated within the timeout limit (60 seconds).
          

          
        

        - **IpAddress** *(string) --* 

          The IP address of the game session. To connect to a Amazon GameLift Servers game server, an app needs both the IP address and port number.

          
        

        - **DnsName** *(string) --* 

          The DNS identifier assigned to the instance that is running the game session. Values have the following format:

           

          
          * TLS-enabled fleets: ``<unique identifier>.<region identifier>.amazongamelift.com``.
           
          * Non-TLS-enabled fleets: ``ec2-<unique identifier>.compute.amazonaws.com``. (See `Amazon EC2 Instance IP Addressing <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-instance-addressing.html#concepts-public-addresses>`__.)
          

           

          When connecting to a game session that is running on a TLS-enabled fleet, you must use the DNS name, not the IP address.

          
        

        - **Port** *(integer) --* 

          Port number for the game session. To connect to a Amazon GameLift Servers server process, an app needs both the IP address and port number.

          
        

        - **PlayerData** *(string) --* 

          Developer-defined information related to a player. Amazon GameLift Servers does not use this data, so it can be formatted as needed for use in the game.
