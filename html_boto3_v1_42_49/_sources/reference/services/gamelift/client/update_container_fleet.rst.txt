.. py:method:: GameLift.Client.update_container_fleet(**kwargs)

  

  **This API works with the following fleet types:** Container

   

  Updates the properties of a managed container fleet. Depending on the properties being updated, this operation might initiate a fleet deployment. You can track deployments for a fleet using `https\://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_DescribeFleetDeployment.html <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_DescribeFleetDeployment.html>`__.

   

  .. note::

    

    A managed fleet's runtime environment, which depends on the fleet's Amazon Machine Image {AMI} version, can't be updated. You must create a new fleet. As a best practice, we recommend replacing your managed fleets every 30 days to maintain a secure and up-to-date runtime environment for your hosted game servers. For guidance, see `Security best practices for Amazon GameLift Servers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftservers/latest/developerguide/security-best-practices.html>`__.

    

   

  **Request options**

   

  As with CreateContainerFleet, many fleet properties use common defaults or are calculated based on the fleet's container group definitions.

   

  
  * Update fleet properties that result in a fleet deployment. Include only those properties that you want to change. Specify deployment configuration settings.
   
  * Update fleet properties that don't result in a fleet deployment. Include only those properties that you want to change.
  

   

  Changes to the following properties initiate a fleet deployment:

   

  
  * ``GameServerContainerGroupDefinition``
   
  * ``PerInstanceContainerGroupDefinition``
   
  * ``GameServerContainerGroupsPerInstance``
   
  * ``InstanceInboundPermissions``
   
  * ``InstanceConnectionPortRange``
   
  * ``LogConfiguration``
  

   

  **Results**

   

  If successful, this operation updates the container fleet resource, and might initiate a new deployment of fleet resources using the deployment configuration provided. A deployment replaces existing fleet instances with new instances that are deployed with the updated fleet properties. The fleet is placed in ``UPDATING`` status until the deployment is complete, then return to ``ACTIVE``.

   

  You can have only one update deployment active at a time for a fleet. If a second update request initiates a deployment while another deployment is in progress, the first deployment is cancelled.

If you're updating the fleet to a specific version of a container group definition, use the ARN value and include the version number. If you're updating the fleet to the latest version of a container group definition, you can use the name value. You can't remove a fleet's game server container group definition, you can only update or replace it with another definition.

     

    Update a container group definition by calling `UpdateContainerGroupDefinition <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_UpdateContainerGroupDefinition.html>`__. This operation creates a `ContainerGroupDefinition <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_ContainerGroupDefinition.html>`__ resource with an incremented version.

    

  
  :type PerInstanceContainerGroupDefinitionName: string
  :param PerInstanceContainerGroupDefinitionName: 

    The name or ARN value of a new per-instance container group definition to deploy on the fleet. If you're updating the fleet to a specific version of a container group definition, use the ARN value and include the version number. If you're updating the fleet to the latest version of a container group definition, you can use the name value.

     

    Update a container group definition by calling `UpdateContainerGroupDefinition <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_UpdateContainerGroupDefinition.html>`__. This operation creates a `ContainerGroupDefinition <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_ContainerGroupDefinition.html>`__ resource with an incremented version.

     

    To remove a fleet's per-instance container group definition, leave this parameter empty and use the parameter ``RemoveAttributes``.

    

  
  :type GameServerContainerGroupsPerInstance: integer
  :param GameServerContainerGroupsPerInstance: 

    The number of times to replicate the game server container group on each fleet instance. By default, Amazon GameLift Servers calculates the maximum number of game server container groups that can fit on each instance.

    - **ProtectionStrategy** *(string) --* 

      Determines how fleet deployment activity affects active game sessions on the fleet. With protection, a deployment honors game session protection, and delays actions that would interrupt a protected active game session until the game session ends. Without protection, deployment activity can shut down all running tasks, including active game sessions, regardless of game session protection.

      

    
    - **MinimumHealthyPercentage** *(integer) --* 

      Sets a minimum level of healthy tasks to maintain during deployment activity.

      

    
    - **ImpairmentStrategy** *(string) --*

With a rollback strategy, updated fleet instances are rolled back to the last successful deployment. Alternatively, you can maintain a few impaired containers for the purpose of debugging, while all other tasks return to the last successful deployment.

      

    
  
  :type Description: string
  :param Description: 

    A meaningful description of the container fleet.

    

  
  :type MetricGroups: list

    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type NewGameSessionProtectionPolicy: string
  :param NewGameSessionProtectionPolicy: 

    The game session protection policy to apply to all new game sessions that are started in this fleet. Game sessions that already exist are not affected.

    

  
  :type GameSessionCreationLimitPolicy: dict
  :param GameSessionCreationLimitPolicy: 

    A policy that limits the number of game sessions that each individual player can create on instances in this fleet. The limit applies for a specified span of time.

    

  
    - **NewGameSessionsPerCreator** *(integer) --* 

      A policy that puts limits on the number of game sessions that a player can create within a specified span of time. With this policy, you can control players' ability to consume available resources.

       

      The policy evaluates when a player tries to create a new game session. On receiving a ``CreateGameSession`` request, Amazon GameLift Servers checks that the player (identified by ``CreatorId``) has created fewer than game session limit in the specified time period.

      

    
    - **PolicyPeriodInMinutes** *(integer) --* 

      The time span used in evaluating the resource creation limit policy.

  :param LogConfiguration: 

    The method for collecting container logs for the fleet.

    

  
    - **LogDestination** *(string) --* 

      The type of log collection to use for a fleet.

       

      
      * ``CLOUDWATCH`` -- (default value) Send logs to an Amazon CloudWatch log group that you define. Each container emits a log stream, which is organized in the log group.
       
      * ``S3`` -- Store logs in an Amazon S3 bucket that you define. This bucket must reside in the fleet's home Amazon Web Services Region.
       
      * ``NONE`` -- Don't collect container logs.
      

      

    
    - **S3BucketName** *(string) --* 

      If log destination is ``S3``, logs are sent to the specified Amazon S3 bucket name.

      

    
    - **LogGroupArn** *(string) --* 

      If log destination is ``CLOUDWATCH``, logs are sent to the specified log group in Amazon CloudWatch.

      

    
  
  :type RemoveAttributes: list
  :param RemoveAttributes: 

    If set, this update removes a fleet's per-instance container group definition. You can't remove a fleet's game server container group definition.

        - **NewGameSessionProtectionPolicy** *(string) --* 

          Determines whether Amazon GameLift Servers can shut down game sessions on the fleet that are actively running and hosting players. Amazon GameLift Servers might prompt an instance shutdown when scaling down fleet capacity or when retiring unhealthy instances. You can also set game session protection for individual game sessions using `UpdateGameSession <gamelift/latest/apireference/API_UpdateGameSession.html>`__.

           

          
          * **NoProtection** -- Game sessions can be shut down during active gameplay.
           
          * **FullProtection** -- Game sessions in ``ACTIVE`` status can't be shut down.
          

          
        

        - **GameSessionCreationLimitPolicy** *(dict) --* 

          A policy that limits the number of game sessions that each individual player can create on instances in this fleet. The limit applies for a specified span of time.

          
          

          - **NewGameSessionsPerCreator** *(integer) --* 

            A policy that puts limits on the number of game sessions that a player can create within a specified span of time. With this policy, you can control players' ability to consume available resources.

             

            The policy evaluates when a player tries to create a new game session. On receiving a ``CreateGameSession`` request, Amazon GameLift Servers checks that the player (identified by ``CreatorId``) has created fewer than game session limit in the specified time period.

            
          

          - **PolicyPeriodInMinutes** *(integer) --* 

            The time span used in evaluating the resource creation limit policy.
