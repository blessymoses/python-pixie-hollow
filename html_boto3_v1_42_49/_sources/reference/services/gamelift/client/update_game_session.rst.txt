            },
        ]
    )
    
  :type GameSessionId: string
  :param GameSessionId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A unique identifier for the game session to update.

    

  
  :type MaximumPlayerSessionCount: integer
  :param MaximumPlayerSessionCount: 

    The maximum number of players that can be connected simultaneously to the game session.

    

  
  :type Name: string
  :param Name: 

    A descriptive label that is associated with a game session. Session names do not need to be unique.

    

  
  :type PlayerSessionCreationPolicy: string
  :param PlayerSessionCreationPolicy: 

    A policy that determines whether the game session is accepting new players.

    

  
  :type ProtectionPolicy: string
  :param ProtectionPolicy: 

    Game session protection policy to apply to this game session only.

     

    
    * ``NoProtection`` -- The game session can be terminated during a scale-down event.
     
    * ``FullProtection`` -- If the game session is in an ``ACTIVE`` status, it cannot be terminated during a scale-down event.
    

    

  
  :type GameProperties: list
  :param GameProperties: 

    A set of key-value pairs that can store custom data in a game session. For example: ``{"Key": "difficulty", "Value": "novice"}``. You can use this parameter to modify game properties in an active game session. This action adds new properties and modifies existing properties. There is no way to delete properties. For an example, see `Update the value of a game property <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-client-api.html#game-properties-update>`__.

     

    .. note::

      

      Avoid using periods (".") in property keys if you plan to search for game sessions by properties. Property keys containing periods cannot be searched and will be filtered out from search results due to search index limitations.

      

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      This key-value pair can store custom data about a game session. For example, you might use a ``GameProperty`` to track a game session's map, level of difficulty, or remaining time. The difficulty level could be specified like this: ``{"Key": "difficulty", "Value":"Novice"}``.

       

      You can set game properties when creating a game session. You can also modify game properties of an active game session. When searching for game sessions, you can filter on game property keys and values. You can't delete game properties from a game session.

       

      For examples of working with game properties, see `Create a game session with properties <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-client-api.html#game-properties>`__.

      

    
      - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The game property identifier.

         

        .. note::

          

          Avoid using periods (".") in property keys if you plan to search for game sessions by properties. Property keys containing periods cannot be searched and will be filtered out from search results due to search index limitations.

          

        

      
      - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The game property value.

        - **GameSessionData** *(string) --* 

          A set of custom game session properties, formatted as a single string value. This data is passed to a game server process with a request to start a new game session.

        - **MatchmakerData** *(string) --* 

          Information about the matchmaking process that resulted in the game session, if matchmaking was used. Data is in JSON syntax, formatted as a string. Information includes the matchmaker ID as well as player attributes and team assignments. For more details on matchmaker data, see `Match Data <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/flexmatchguide/match-server.html#match-server-data>`__. Matchmaker data is updated whenever new players are added during a successful backfill (see `StartMatchBackfill <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_StartMatchBackfill.html>`__).

          
        

        - **Location** *(string) --* 

          The fleet location where the game session is running. This value might specify the fleet's home Region or a remote location. Location is expressed as an Amazon Web Services Region code such as ``us-west-2``.
