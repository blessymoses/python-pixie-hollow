.. py:method:: GameLift.Client.start_matchmaking(**kwargs)

  

  **This API works with the following fleet types:** EC2, Anywhere, Container

   

  Uses FlexMatch to create a game match for a group of players based on custom matchmaking rules. With games that use Amazon GameLift Servers managed hosting, this operation also triggers Amazon GameLift Servers to find hosting resources and start a new game session for the new match. Each matchmaking request includes information on one or more players and specifies the FlexMatch matchmaker to use. When a request is for multiple players, FlexMatch attempts to build a match that includes all players in the request, placing them in the same team and finding additional players as needed to fill the match.

   

  To start matchmaking, provide a unique ticket ID, specify a matchmaking configuration, and include the players to be matched. You must also include any player attributes that are required by the matchmaking configuration's rule set. If successful, a matchmaking ticket is returned with status set to ``QUEUED``.

   

  Track matchmaking events to respond as needed and acquire game session connection information for successfully completed matches. Ticket status updates are tracked using event notification through Amazon Simple Notification Service, which is defined in the matchmaking configuration.

  :type TicketId: string
  :param TicketId:

  :type ConfigurationName: string
  :param ConfigurationName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Name of the matchmaking configuration to use for this request. Matchmaking configurations must exist in the same Region as this request. You can use either the configuration name or ARN value.

    

  
  :type Players: list
  :param Players: **[REQUIRED]**

    You can include up to 10 ``Players`` in a ``StartMatchmaking`` request.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      Represents a player in matchmaking. When starting a matchmaking request, a player has a player ID, attributes, and may have latency data. Team information is added after a match has been successfully completed.

      

    
      - **PlayerId** *(string) --* 

        A unique identifier for a player

        

      
      - **PlayerAttributes** *(dict) --* 

        A collection of key:value pairs containing player information for use in matchmaking. Player attribute keys must match the *playerAttributes* used in a matchmaking rule set. Example: ``"PlayerAttributes": {"skill": {"N": "23"}, "gameMode": {"S": "deathmatch"}}``.

         

        You can provide up to 10 ``PlayerAttributes``.

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
          - *(dict) --* 

            Values for use in player attribute key-value pairs. This object lets you specify an attribute value using any of the valid data types: string, number, string array, or data map. Each ``AttributeValue`` object can use only one of the available properties.

            

          
            - **S** *(string) --* 

              For single string values. Maximum string length is 100 characters.

              

            
            - **N** *(float) --*

      - **LatencyInMs** *(dict) --* 

        A set of values, expressed in milliseconds, that indicates the amount of latency that a player experiences when connected to Amazon Web Services Regions. If this property is present, FlexMatch considers placing the match only in Regions for which latency is reported.

         

        If a matchmaker has a rule that evaluates player latency, players must report latency in order to be matched. If no latency is reported in this scenario, FlexMatch assumes that no Regions are available to the player and the ticket is not matchable.

        

      
        - *(string) --*

          - *(dict) --* 

            Represents a player in matchmaking. When starting a matchmaking request, a player has a player ID, attributes, and may have latency data. Team information is added after a match has been successfully completed.

                - *(integer) --* 
          
        
        
      
        

        - **GameSessionConnectionInfo** *(dict) --* 

          Connection information for a new game session. Once a match is made, the FlexMatch engine creates a new game session for it.

          - **IpAddress** *(string) --* 

            The IP address of the game session. To connect to a Amazon GameLift Servers game server, an app needs both the IP address and port number.

            
          

          - **DnsName** *(string) --* 

            The DNS identifier assigned to the instance that is running the game session. Values have the following format:

             

            
            * TLS-enabled fleets: ``<unique identifier>.<region identifier>.amazongamelift.com``.
             
            * Non-TLS-enabled fleets: ``ec2-<unique identifier>.compute.amazonaws.com``. (See `Amazon EC2 Instance IP Addressing <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-instance-addressing.html#concepts-public-addresses>`__.)
            

             

            When connecting to a game session that is running on a TLS-enabled fleet, you must use the DNS name, not the IP address.

            
          

          - **Port** *(integer) --* 

            The port number for the game session. To connect to a Amazon GameLift Servers game server, an app needs both the IP address and port number.

            - *(dict) --* 

              Represents a new player session that is created as a result of a successful FlexMatch match. A successful match automatically creates new player sessions for every player ID in the original matchmaking request.

               

              When players connect to the match's game session, they must include both player ID and player session ID in order to claim their assigned player slot.

              
              

              - **PlayerId** *(string) --* 

                A unique identifier for a player

                
              

              - **PlayerSessionId** *(string) --* 

                A unique identifier for a player session

                
          
        
      
        

        - **EstimatedWaitTime** *(integer) --* 

          Average amount of time (in seconds) that players are currently waiting for a match. If there is not enough recent data, this property may be empty.
