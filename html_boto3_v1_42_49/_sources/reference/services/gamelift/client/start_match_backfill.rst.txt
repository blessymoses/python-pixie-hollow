.. py:method:: GameLift.Client.start_match_backfill(**kwargs)

  

  **This API works with the following fleet types:** EC2, Anywhere, Container

   

  Finds new players to fill open slots in currently running game sessions. The backfill match process is essentially identical to the process of forming new matches. Backfill requests use the same matchmaker that was used to make the original match, and they provide matchmaking data for all players currently in the game session. FlexMatch uses this information to select new players so that backfilled match continues to meet the original match requirements.

   

  When using FlexMatch with Amazon GameLift Servers managed hosting, you can request a backfill match from a client service by calling this operation with a ``GameSessions`` ID. You also have the option of making backfill requests directly from your game server. In response to a request, FlexMatch creates player sessions for the new players, updates the ``GameSession`` resource, and sends updated matchmaking data to the game server. You can request a backfill match at any point after a game session is started. Each game session can have only one active backfill request at a time; a subsequent request automatically replaces the earlier request.

   

  When using FlexMatch as a standalone component, request a backfill match by calling this operation without a game session identifier. As with newly formed matches, matchmaking results are returned in a matchmaking event so that your game can update the game session that is being backfilled.

   

  To request a backfill match, specify a unique ticket ID, the original matchmaking configuration, and matchmaking data for all current players in the game session being backfilled. Optionally, specify the ``GameSession`` ARN. If successful, a match backfill ticket is created and returned with status set to QUEUED. Track the status of backfill tickets using the same method for tracking tickets for new matches.

   

  Only game sessions created by FlexMatch are supported for match backfill.

  :type TicketId: string
  :param TicketId: 

    A unique identifier for a matchmaking ticket. If no ticket ID is specified here, Amazon GameLift Servers will generate one in the form of a UUID. Use this identifier to track the match backfill ticket status and retrieve match results.

    

  
  :type ConfigurationName: string
  :param ConfigurationName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Name of the matchmaker to use for this request. You can use either the configuration name or ARN value. The ARN of the matchmaker that was used with the original game session is listed in the ``GameSession`` object, ``MatchmakerData`` property.

    

  
  :type GameSessionArn: string
  :param GameSessionArn: 

    A unique identifier for the game session. Use the game session ID. When using FlexMatch as a standalone matchmaking solution, this parameter is not needed.

    

  
  :type Players: list
  :param Players: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Match information on all players that are currently assigned to the game session. This information is used by the matchmaker to find new players and add them to the existing game.

     

    You can include up to 199 ``Players`` in a ``StartMatchBackfill`` request.

     

    
    * PlayerID, PlayerAttributes, Team -- This information is maintained in the ``GameSession`` object, ``MatchmakerData`` property, for all players who are currently assigned to the game session. The matchmaker data is in JSON syntax, formatted as a string. For more details, see `Match Data <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/flexmatchguide/match-server.html#match-server-data>`__. The backfill request must specify the team membership for every player. Do not specify team if you are not using backfill.
     
    * LatencyInMs -- If the matchmaker uses player latency, include a latency value, in milliseconds, for the Region that the game session is currently in. Do not include latency values for any other Region.
    

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      Represents a player in matchmaking. When starting a matchmaking request, a player has a player ID, attributes, and may have latency data. Team information is added after a match has been successfully completed.

      

    
      - **PlayerId** *(string) --* 

        A unique identifier for a player

        

      
      - **PlayerAttributes** *(dict) --* 

        A collection of key:value pairs containing player information for use in matchmaking. Player attribute keys must match the *playerAttributes* used in a matchmaking rule set. Example: ``"PlayerAttributes": {"skill": {"N": "23"}, "gameMode": {"S": "deathmatch"}}``.

         

        You can provide up to 10 ``PlayerAttributes``.

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
          - *(dict) --* 

            Values for use in player attribute key-value pairs. This object lets you specify an attribute value using any of the valid data types: string, number, string array, or data map. Each ``AttributeValue`` object can use only one of the available properties.

            

          
            - **S** *(string) --* 

              For single string values. Maximum string length is 100 characters.

        - **GameSessionConnectionInfo** *(dict) --* 

          Connection information for a new game session. Once a match is made, the FlexMatch engine creates a new game session for it. This information is added to the matchmaking ticket, which you can be retrieve by calling `DescribeMatchmaking <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_DescribeMatchmaking.html>`__ .

          
          

          - **GameSessionArn** *(string) --* 

            A unique identifier for the game session. Use the game session ID.

            
          

          - **IpAddress** *(string) --* 

            The IP address of the game session. To connect to a Amazon GameLift Servers game server, an app needs both the IP address and port number.

            
          

          - **DnsName** *(string) --* 

            The DNS identifier assigned to the instance that is running the game session. Values have the following format:

             

            
            * TLS-enabled fleets: ``<unique identifier>.<region identifier>.amazongamelift.com``.
             
            * Non-TLS-enabled fleets: ``ec2-<unique identifier>.compute.amazonaws.com``. (See `Amazon EC2 Instance IP Addressing <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-instance-addressing.html#concepts-public-addresses>`__.)
            

             

            When connecting to a game session that is running on a TLS-enabled fleet, you must use the DNS name, not the IP address.

            
          

          - **Port** *(integer) --* 

            The port number for the game session. To connect to a Amazon GameLift Servers game server, an app needs both the IP address and port number.

            
          

          - **MatchedPlayerSessions** *(list) --* 

            A collection of player session IDs, one for each player ID that was included in the original matchmaking request.

            
            

            - *(dict) --*
