.. py:method:: GameLift.Client.create_alias(**kwargs)

  

  **This API works with the following fleet types:** EC2, Anywhere, Container

   

  Creates an alias for a fleet. In most situations, you can use an alias ID in place of a fleet ID. An alias provides a level of abstraction for a fleet that is useful when redirecting player traffic from one fleet to another, such as when updating your game build.

   

  Amazon GameLift Servers supports two types of routing strategies for aliases: simple and terminal. A simple alias points to an active fleet. A terminal alias is used to display messaging or link to a URL instead of routing players to an active fleet. For example, you might use a terminal alias when a game version is no longer supported and you want to direct players to an upgrade site.

   

  To create a fleet alias, specify an alias name, routing strategy, and optional description. Each simple alias can point to only one fleet, but a fleet can have multiple aliases. If successful, a new alias record is returned, including an alias ID and an ARN. You can reassign an alias to another fleet by calling ``UpdateAlias``.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.create_alias(
        Name='string',
        Description='string',
        RoutingStrategy={
            'Type': 'SIMPLE'|'TERMINAL',
            'FleetId': 'string',
            'Message': 'string'
        },
        Tags=[
            {
                'Key': 'string',

            },
        ]
    )
    
  :type Name: string
  :param Name: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A descriptive label that is associated with an alias. Alias names do not need to be unique.

    

  
  :type Description: string
  :param Description: 

    A human-readable description of the alias.

    

  
  :type RoutingStrategy: dict
  :param RoutingStrategy: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The routing configuration, including routing type and fleet target, for the alias.

    

  
    - **Type** *(string) --* 

      The type of routing strategy for the alias.

       

      Possible routing types include the following:

       

      
      * **SIMPLE** - The alias resolves to one specific fleet. Use this type when routing to active fleets.
       
      * **TERMINAL** - The alias does not resolve to a fleet but instead can be used to display a message to the user. A terminal alias throws a TerminalRoutingStrategyException with the message embedded.
      

      

    
    - **FleetId** *(string) --* 

      A unique identifier for the fleet that the alias points to. This value is the fleet ID, not the fleet ARN.

      

    
    - **Message** *(string) --* 

      The message text to be used with a terminal routing strategy.

      

    
  
  :type Tags: list
  :param Tags: 

    A list of labels to assign to the new alias resource. Tags are developer-defined key-value pairs. Tagging Amazon Web Services resources are useful for resource management, access management and cost allocation. For more information, see `Tagging Amazon Web Services Resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      A label that you can assign to a Amazon GameLift Servers resource.
