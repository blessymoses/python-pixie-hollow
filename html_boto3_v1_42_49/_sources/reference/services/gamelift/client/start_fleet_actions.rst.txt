.. py:method:: GameLift.Client.start_fleet_actions(**kwargs)

  

  **This API works with the following fleet types:** EC2, Container

   

  Resumes certain types of activity on fleet instances that were suspended with `StopFleetActions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_StopFleetActions.html>`__. For multi-location fleets, fleet actions are managed separately for each location. Currently, this operation is used to restart a fleet's auto-scaling activity.

   

  This operation can be used in the following ways:

   

  
  * To restart actions on instances in the fleet's home Region, provide a fleet ID and the type of actions to resume.
   
  * To restart actions on instances in one of the fleet's remote locations, provide a fleet ID, a location name, and the type of actions to resume.
  

   

  If successful, Amazon GameLift Servers once again initiates scaling events as triggered by the fleet's scaling policies. If actions on the fleet location were never stopped, this operation will have no effect.
