.. py:method:: GameLift.Client.delete_fleet_locations(**kwargs)

  

  **This API works with the following fleet types:** EC2, Container

   

  Removes locations from a multi-location fleet. When deleting a location, all game server process and all instances that are still active in the location are shut down.

   

  To delete fleet locations, identify the fleet ID and provide a list of the locations to be deleted.

   

  If successful, GameLift sets the location status to ``DELETING``, and begins to shut down existing server processes and terminate instances in each location being deleted. When completed, the location status changes to ``TERMINATED``.

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **FleetId** *(string) --* 

        A unique identifier for the fleet that location attributes are being deleted for.

        
      

      - **FleetArn** *(string) --* 

        The Amazon Resource Name ( `ARN <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-arn-format.html>`__) that is assigned to a Amazon GameLift Servers fleet resource and uniquely identifies it. ARNs are unique across all Regions. Format is ``arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::fleet/fleet-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912``.

        
      

      - **LocationStates** *(list) --* 

        The remote locations that are being deleted, with each location status set to ``DELETING``.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          A fleet location and its life-cycle state. A location state object might be used to describe a fleet's remote location or home Region. Life-cycle state tracks the progress of launching the first instance in a new location and preparing it for game hosting, and then removing all instances and deleting the location from the fleet.

           

          
          * **NEW** -- A new fleet location has been defined and desired instances is set to 1.
           
          * **DOWNLOADING/VALIDATING/BUILDING/ACTIVATING** -- Amazon GameLift Servers is setting up the new fleet location, creating new instances with the game build or Realtime script and starting server processes.
           
          * **ACTIVE** -- Hosts can now accept game sessions.
           
          * **ERROR** -- An error occurred when downloading, validating, building, or activating the fleet location.
           
          * **DELETING** -- Hosts are responding to a delete fleet location request.
           
          * **TERMINATED** -- The fleet location no longer exists.
           
          * **NOT_FOUND** -- The fleet location was not found. This could be because the custom location was removed or not created.
          

          
          

          - **Location** *(string) --* 

            The fleet location, expressed as an Amazon Web Services Region code such as ``us-west-2``.

            
          

          - **Status** *(string) --* 

            The life-cycle status of a fleet location.
