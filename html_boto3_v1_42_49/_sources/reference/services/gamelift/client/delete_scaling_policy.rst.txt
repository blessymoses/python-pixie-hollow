.. py:method:: GameLift.Client.delete_scaling_policy(**kwargs)

  

  **This API works with the following fleet types:** EC2

   

  Deletes a fleet scaling policy. Once deleted, the policy is no longer in force and Amazon GameLift Servers removes all record of it. To delete a scaling policy, specify both the scaling policy name and the fleet ID it is associated with.

   

  To temporarily suspend scaling policies, use `StopFleetActions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_StopFleetActions.html>`__. This operation suspends all policies for the fleet.
