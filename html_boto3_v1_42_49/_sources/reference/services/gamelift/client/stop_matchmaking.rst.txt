.. py:method:: GameLift.Client.stop_matchmaking(**kwargs)

  

  **This API works with the following fleet types:** EC2, Anywhere, Container

   

  Cancels a matchmaking ticket or match backfill ticket that is currently being processed. To stop the matchmaking operation, specify the ticket ID. If successful, work on the ticket is stopped, and the ticket status is changed to ``CANCELLED``.

   

  This call is also used to turn off automatic backfill for an individual game session. This is for game sessions that are created with a matchmaking configuration that has automatic backfill enabled. The ticket ID is included in the ``MatchmakerData`` of an updated game session object, which is provided to the game server.

   

  .. note::

    

    If the operation is successful, the service sends back an empty JSON struct with the HTTP 200 response (not an empty HTTP body).
