.. py:method:: GameLift.Client.deregister_compute(**kwargs)

  

  **This API works with the following fleet types:** Anywhere

   

  Removes a compute resource from an Anywhere fleet. Deregistered computes can no longer host game sessions through Amazon GameLift Servers. Use this operation with an Anywhere fleet that doesn't use the Amazon GameLift Servers Agent For Anywhere fleets with the Agent, the Agent handles all compute registry tasks for you.

   

  To deregister a compute, call this operation from the compute that's being deregistered and specify the compute name and the fleet ID.
