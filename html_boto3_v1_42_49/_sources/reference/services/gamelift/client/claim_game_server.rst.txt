.. py:method:: GameLift.Client.claim_game_server(**kwargs)

  

  **This API works with the following fleet types:** EC2 (FleetIQ)

   

  Locates an available game server and temporarily reserves it to host gameplay and players. This operation is called from a game client or client service (such as a matchmaker) to request hosting resources for a new game session. In response, Amazon GameLift Servers FleetIQ locates an available game server, places it in ``CLAIMED`` status for 60 seconds, and returns connection information that players can use to connect to the game server.

   

  To claim a game server, identify a game server group. You can also specify a game server ID, although this approach bypasses Amazon GameLift Servers FleetIQ placement optimization. Optionally, include game data to pass to the game server at the start of a game session, such as a game map or player information. Add filter options to further restrict how a game server is chosen, such as only allowing game servers on ``ACTIVE`` instances to be claimed.

   

  When a game server is successfully claimed, connection information is returned. A claimed game server's utilization status remains ``AVAILABLE`` while the claim status is set to ``CLAIMED`` for up to 60 seconds. This time period gives the game server time to update its status to ``UTILIZED`` after players join. If the game server's status is not updated within 60 seconds, the game server reverts to unclaimed status and is available to be claimed by another request. The claim time period is a fixed value and is not configurable.

   

  If you try to claim a specific game server, this request will fail in the following cases:

   

  
  * If the game server utilization status is ``UTILIZED``.
   
  * If the game server claim status is ``CLAIMED``.
   
  * If the game server is running on an instance in ``DRAINING`` status and the provided filter option does not allow placing on ``DRAINING`` instances.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.claim_game_server(
        GameServerGroupName='string',
        GameServerId='string',
        GameServerData='string',
        FilterOption={
            'InstanceStatuses': [
                'ACTIVE'|'DRAINING',
            ]
        }
    )
    
  :type GameServerGroupName: string
  :param GameServerGroupName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A unique identifier for the game server group where the game server is running. If you are not specifying a game server to claim, this value identifies where you want Amazon GameLift Servers FleetIQ to look for an available game server to claim.

    

  
  :type GameServerId: string
  :param GameServerId: 

    A custom string that uniquely identifies the game server to claim. If this parameter is left empty, Amazon GameLift Servers FleetIQ searches for an available game server in the specified game server group.

    

  
  :type GameServerData: string
  :param GameServerData: 

    A set of custom game server properties, formatted as a single string value. This data is passed to a game client or service when it requests information on game servers.

    

  
  :type FilterOption: dict
  :param FilterOption: 

    Object that restricts how a claimed game server is chosen.

    

  
    - **InstanceStatuses** *(list) --* 

      List of instance statuses that game servers may be claimed on. If provided, the list must contain the ``ACTIVE`` status.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **GameServer** *(dict) --* 

        Object that describes the newly claimed game server.

        
        

        - **GameServerGroupName** *(string) --* 

          A unique identifier for the game server group where the game server is running.

          
        

        - **GameServerGroupArn** *(string) --* 

          The ARN identifier for the game server group where the game server is located.

          
        

        - **GameServerId** *(string) --* 

          A custom string that uniquely identifies the game server. Game server IDs are developer-defined and are unique across all game server groups in an Amazon Web Services account.

          
        

        - **InstanceId** *(string) --* 

          The unique identifier for the instance where the game server is running. This ID is available in the instance metadata. EC2 instance IDs use a 17-character format, for example: ``i-1234567890abcdef0``.

          
        

        - **ConnectionInfo** *(string) --* 

          The port and IP address that must be used to establish a client connection to the game server.

          
        

        - **GameServerData** *(string) --* 

          A set of custom game server properties, formatted as a single string value. This data is passed to a game client or service when it requests information on game servers.

          
        

        - **ClaimStatus** *(string) --* 

          Indicates when an available game server has been reserved for gameplay but has not yet started hosting a game. Once it is claimed, the game server remains in ``CLAIMED`` status for a maximum of one minute. During this time, game clients connect to the game server to start the game and trigger the game server to update its utilization status. After one minute, the game server claim status reverts to null.

          
        

        - **UtilizationStatus** *(string) --* 

          Indicates whether the game server is currently available for new games or is busy. Possible statuses include:

           

          
          * ``AVAILABLE`` - The game server is available to be claimed. A game server that has been claimed remains in this status until it reports game hosting activity.
           
          * ``UTILIZED`` - The game server is currently hosting a game session with players.
          

          
        

        - **RegistrationTime** *(datetime) --* 

          Timestamp that indicates when the game server registered. The format is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for example ``"1469498468.057"``).

          
        

        - **LastClaimTime** *(datetime) --* 

          Timestamp that indicates the last time the game server was claimed. The format is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for example ``"1469498468.057"``). This value is used to calculate when a claimed game server's status should revert to null.

          
        

        - **LastHealthCheckTime** *(datetime) --* 

          Timestamp that indicates the last time the game server was updated with health status. The format is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for example ``"1469498468.057"``). After game server registration, this property is only changed when a game server update specifies a health check value.
