.. py:method:: GameLift.Client.describe_matchmaking_configurations(**kwargs)

  

  **This API works with the following fleet types:** EC2, Anywhere, Container

   

  Retrieves the details of FlexMatch matchmaking configurations.

   

  This operation offers the following options: (1) retrieve all matchmaking configurations, (2) retrieve configurations for a specified list, or (3) retrieve all configurations that use a specified rule set name. When requesting multiple items, use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages.

   

  If successful, a configuration is returned for each requested name. When specifying a list of names, only configurations that currently exist are returned.

        - *(dict) --* 

          Guidelines for use with FlexMatch to match players into games. All matchmaking requests must specify a matchmaking configuration.

          
          

          - **Name** *(string) --* 

            A unique identifier for the matchmaking configuration. This name is used to identify the configuration associated with a matchmaking request or ticket.

            
          

          - **ConfigurationArn** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Name ( `ARN <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-arn-format.html>`__) that is assigned to a Amazon GameLift Servers matchmaking configuration resource and uniquely identifies it. ARNs are unique across all Regions. Format is ``arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::matchmakingconfiguration/<matchmaking configuration name>``. In a Amazon GameLift Servers configuration ARN, the resource ID matches the *Name* value.

            
          

          - **Description** *(string) --* 

            A descriptive label that is associated with matchmaking configuration.

            
          

          - **GameSessionQueueArns** *(list) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Name ( `ARN <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-arn-format.html>`__) that is assigned to a Amazon GameLift Servers game session queue resource and uniquely identifies it. ARNs are unique across all Regions. Format is ``arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::gamesessionqueue/<queue name>``. Queues can be located in any Region. Queues are used to start new Amazon GameLift Servers-hosted game sessions for matches that are created with this matchmaking configuration. This property is not set when ``FlexMatchMode`` is set to ``STANDALONE``.

            
            

            - *(string) --* 
        
          

          - **RequestTimeoutSeconds** *(integer) --* 

            The maximum duration, in seconds, that a matchmaking ticket can remain in process before timing out. Requests that fail due to timing out can be resubmitted as needed.

            
          

          - **AcceptanceTimeoutSeconds** *(integer) --* 

            The length of time (in seconds) to wait for players to accept a proposed match, if acceptance is required. If any player rejects the match or fails to accept before the timeout, the ticket continues to look for an acceptable match.

            
          

          - **AcceptanceRequired** *(boolean) --* 

            A flag that indicates whether a match that was created with this configuration must be accepted by the matched players. To require acceptance, set to TRUE. When this option is enabled, matchmaking tickets use the status ``REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE`` to indicate when a completed potential match is waiting for player acceptance.

            
          

          - **RuleSetName** *(string) --* 

            A unique identifier for the matchmaking rule set to use with this configuration. A matchmaking configuration can only use rule sets that are defined in the same Region.

            
          

          - **RuleSetArn** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Name ( `ARN <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-arn-format.html>`__) associated with the GameLift matchmaking rule set resource that this configuration uses.

            
          

          - **NotificationTarget** *(string) --* 

            An SNS topic ARN that is set up to receive matchmaking notifications.

            
          

          - **AdditionalPlayerCount** *(integer) --* 

            The number of player slots in a match to keep open for future players. For example, if the configuration's rule set specifies a match for a single 12-person team, and the additional player count is set to 2, only 10 players are selected for the match. This parameter is not used when ``FlexMatchMode`` is set to ``STANDALONE``.

            
          

          - **CustomEventData** *(string) --* 

            Information to attach to all events related to the matchmaking configuration.

            
          

          - **CreationTime** *(datetime) --* 

            A time stamp indicating when this data object was created. Format is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for example ``"1469498468.057"``).

            
          

          - **GameProperties** *(list) --* 

            A set of key-value pairs that can store custom data in a game session. For example: ``{"Key": "difficulty", "Value": "novice"}``. This information is added to the new ``GameSession`` object that is created for a successful match. This parameter is not used when ``FlexMatchMode`` is set to ``STANDALONE``.

             

            .. note::

              

              Avoid using periods (".") in property keys if you plan to search for game sessions by properties. Property keys containing periods cannot be searched and will be filtered out from search results due to search index limitations.

              

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

              This key-value pair can store custom data about a game session. For example, you might use a ``GameProperty`` to track a game session's map, level of difficulty, or remaining time. The difficulty level could be specified like this: ``{"Key": "difficulty", "Value":"Novice"}``.

               

              You can set game properties when creating a game session. You can also modify game properties of an active game session. When searching for game sessions, you can filter on game property keys and values. You can't delete game properties from a game session.

               

              For examples of working with game properties, see `Create a game session with properties <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-client-api.html#game-properties>`__.

                The game property identifier.

                 

                .. note::

                  

                  Avoid using periods (".") in property keys if you plan to search for game sessions by properties. Property keys containing periods cannot be searched and will be filtered out from search results due to search index limitations.

                  

                
              

              - **Value** *(string) --* 

                The game property value.

                
          
        
          

          - **GameSessionData** *(string) --* 

            A set of custom game session properties, formatted as a single string value. This data is passed to a game server process with a request to start a new game session. For more information, see `Start a game session <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-server-api.html#gamelift-sdk-server-startsession>`__. This information is added to the new ``GameSession`` object that is created for a successful match. This parameter is not used when ``FlexMatchMode`` is set to ``STANDALONE``.

            
          

          - **BackfillMode** *(string) --* 

            The method used to backfill game sessions created with this matchmaking configuration. MANUAL indicates that the game makes backfill requests or does not use the match backfill feature. AUTOMATIC indicates that GameLift creates backfill requests whenever a game session has one or more open slots. Learn more about manual and automatic backfill in `Backfill existing games with FlexMatch <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/flexmatchguide/match-backfill.html>`__. Automatic backfill is not available when ``FlexMatchMode`` is set to ``STANDALONE``.

            
          

          - **FlexMatchMode** *(string) --*

            * **WITH_QUEUE** - FlexMatch forms matches and uses the specified Amazon GameLift Servers queue to start a game session for the match.
            

            
      
    
      

      - **NextToken** *(string) --*
