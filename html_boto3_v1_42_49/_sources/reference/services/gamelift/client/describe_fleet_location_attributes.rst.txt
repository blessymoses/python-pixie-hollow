.. py:method:: GameLift.Client.describe_fleet_location_attributes(**kwargs)

  

  **This API works with the following fleet types:** EC2, Container

   

  Retrieves information on a fleet's remote locations, including life-cycle status and any suspended fleet activity.

   

  This operation can be used in the following ways:

   

  
  * To get data for specific locations, provide a fleet identifier and a list of locations. Location data is returned in the order that it is requested.
   
  * To get data for all locations, provide a fleet identifier only. Location data is returned in no particular order.
  

   

  When requesting attributes for multiple locations, use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages.

   

  If successful, a ``LocationAttributes`` object is returned for each requested location. If the fleet does not have a requested location, no information is returned. This operation does not return the home Region. To get information on a fleet's home Region, call ``DescribeFleetAttributes``.
