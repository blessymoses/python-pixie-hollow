.. py:method:: GameLift.Client.create_game_server_group(**kwargs)

  

  **This API works with the following fleet types:** EC2 (FleetIQ)

   

  Creates a Amazon GameLift Servers FleetIQ game server group for managing game hosting on a collection of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud instances for game hosting. This operation creates the game server group, creates an Auto Scaling group in your Amazon Web Services account, and establishes a link between the two groups. You can view the status of your game server groups in the Amazon GameLift Servers console. Game server group metrics and events are emitted to Amazon CloudWatch.

   

  Before creating a new game server group, you must have the following:

   

  
  * An Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud launch template that specifies how to launch Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud instances with your game server build. For more information, see `Launching an Instance from a Launch Template <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-launch-templates.html>`__ in the *Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide*.
   
  * An IAM role that extends limited access to your Amazon Web Services account to allow Amazon GameLift Servers FleetIQ to create and interact with the Auto Scaling group. For more information, see `Create IAM roles for cross-service interaction <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/fleetiqguide/gsg-iam-permissions-roles.html>`__ in the *Amazon GameLift Servers FleetIQ Developer Guide*.
  

   

  To create a new game server group, specify a unique group name, IAM role and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud launch template, and provide a list of instance types that can be used in the group. You must also set initial maximum and minimum limits on the group's instance count. You can optionally set an Auto Scaling policy with target tracking based on a Amazon GameLift Servers FleetIQ metric.

   

  Once the game server group and corresponding Auto Scaling group are created, you have full access to change the Auto Scaling group's configuration as needed. Several properties that are set when creating a game server group, including maximum/minimum size and auto-scaling policy settings, must be updated directly in the Auto Scaling group. Keep in mind that some Auto Scaling group properties are periodically updated by Amazon GameLift Servers FleetIQ as part of its balancing activities to optimize for availability and cost.

    )
    
  :type GameServerGroupName: string
  :param GameServerGroupName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    An identifier for the new game server group. This value is used to generate unique ARN identifiers for the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group and the Amazon GameLift Servers FleetIQ game server group. The name must be unique per Region per Amazon Web Services account.

    

  
  :type RoleArn: string
  :param RoleArn: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The Amazon Resource Name ( `ARN <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-arn-format.html>`__) for an IAM role that allows Amazon GameLift Servers to access your Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups.

    

  
  :type MinSize: integer
  :param MinSize: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The minimum number of instances allowed in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group. During automatic scaling events, Amazon GameLift Servers FleetIQ and Amazon EC2 do not scale down the group below this minimum. In production, this value should be set to at least 1. After the Auto Scaling group is created, update this value directly in the Auto Scaling group using the Amazon Web Services console or APIs.

    

  
  :type MaxSize: integer
  :param MaxSize: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The maximum number of instances allowed in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group. During automatic scaling events, Amazon GameLift Servers FleetIQ and EC2 do not scale up the group above this maximum. After the Auto Scaling group is created, update this value directly in the Auto Scaling group using the Amazon Web Services console or APIs.

    

  
  :type LaunchTemplate: dict
  :param LaunchTemplate: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The Amazon EC2 launch template that contains configuration settings and game server code to be deployed to all instances in the game server group. You can specify the template using either the template name or ID. For help with creating a launch template, see `Creating a Launch Template for an Auto Scaling Group <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/create-launch-template.html>`__ in the *Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud Auto Scaling User Guide*. After the Auto Scaling group is created, update this value directly in the Auto Scaling group using the Amazon Web Services console or APIs.

     

    .. note::

      

      If you specify network interfaces in your launch template, you must explicitly set the property ``AssociatePublicIpAddress`` to "true". If no network interface is specified in the launch template, Amazon GameLift Servers FleetIQ uses your account's default VPC.

      

    

  
    - **LaunchTemplateId** *(string) --* 

      A unique identifier for an existing Amazon EC2 launch template.

      

    
    - **LaunchTemplateName** *(string) --* 

      A readable identifier for an existing Amazon EC2 launch template.

      

    
    - **Version** *(string) --* 

      The version of the Amazon EC2 launch template to use. If no version is specified, the default version will be used. With Amazon EC2, you can specify a default version for a launch template. If none is set, the default is the first version created.

      

    
  
  :type InstanceDefinitions: list
  :param InstanceDefinitions: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The Amazon EC2 instance types and sizes to use in the Auto Scaling group. The instance definitions must specify at least two different instance types that are supported by Amazon GameLift Servers FleetIQ. For more information on instance types, see `EC2 Instance Types <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html>`__ in the *Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide*. You can optionally specify capacity weighting for each instance type. If no weight value is specified for an instance type, it is set to the default value "1". For more information about capacity weighting, see `Instance Weighting for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/asg-instance-weighting.html>`__ in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      An allowed instance type for a game server group. All game server groups must have at least two instance types defined for it. Amazon GameLift Servers FleetIQ periodically evaluates each defined instance type for viability. It then updates the Auto Scaling group with the list of viable instance types.

      

    
      - **InstanceType** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        An Amazon EC2 instance type designation.

        

      
      - **WeightedCapacity** *(string) --* 

        Instance weighting that indicates how much this instance type contributes to the total capacity of a game server group. Instance weights are used by Amazon GameLift Servers FleetIQ to calculate the instance type's cost per unit hour and better identify the most cost-effective options. For detailed information on weighting instance capacity, see `Instance Weighting <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/asg-instance-weighting.html>`__ in the *Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud Auto Scaling User Guide*. Default value is "1".

        

      
    

  :type AutoScalingPolicy: dict
  :param AutoScalingPolicy: 

    Configuration settings to define a scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group that is optimized for game hosting. The scaling policy uses the metric ``"PercentUtilizedGameServers"`` to maintain a buffer of idle game servers that can immediately accommodate new games and players. After the Auto Scaling group is created, update this value directly in the Auto Scaling group using the Amazon Web Services console or APIs.

    

  
    - **EstimatedInstanceWarmup** *(integer) --* 

      Length of time, in seconds, it takes for a new instance to start new game server processes and register with Amazon GameLift Servers FleetIQ. Specifying a warm-up time can be useful, particularly with game servers that take a long time to start up, because it avoids prematurely starting new instances.

      

    
    - **TargetTrackingConfiguration** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      Settings for a target-based scaling policy applied to Auto Scaling group. These settings are used to create a target-based policy that tracks the Amazon GameLift Servers FleetIQ metric ``"PercentUtilizedGameServers"`` and specifies a target value for the metric. As player usage changes, the policy triggers to adjust the game server group capacity so that the metric returns to the target value.

      

    
      - **TargetValue** *(float) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        Desired value to use with a game server group target-based scaling policy.

        

      
    
  
  :type BalancingStrategy: string
  :param BalancingStrategy: 

    Indicates how Amazon GameLift Servers FleetIQ balances the use of Spot Instances and On-Demand Instances in the game server group. Method options include the following:

     

    
    * ``SPOT_ONLY`` - Only Spot Instances are used in the game server group. If Spot Instances are unavailable or not viable for game hosting, the game server group provides no hosting capacity until Spot Instances can again be used. Until then, no new instances are started, and the existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay ends) and are not replaced.
     
    * ``SPOT_PREFERRED`` - (default value) Spot Instances are used whenever available in the game server group. If Spot Instances are unavailable, the game server group continues to provide hosting capacity by falling back to On-Demand Instances. Existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay ends) and are replaced with new On-Demand Instances.
     
    * ``ON_DEMAND_ONLY`` - Only On-Demand Instances are used in the game server group. No Spot Instances are used, even when available, while this balancing strategy is in force.
    

    

  
  :type GameServerProtectionPolicy: string
  :param GameServerProtectionPolicy: 

    A flag that indicates whether instances in the game server group are protected from early termination. Unprotected instances that have active game servers running might be terminated during a scale-down event, causing players to be dropped from the game. Protected instances cannot be terminated while there are active game servers running except in the event of a forced game server group deletion (see ). An exception to this is with Spot Instances, which can be terminated by Amazon Web Services regardless of protection status. This property is set to ``NO_PROTECTION`` by default.

    

  
  :type VpcSubnets: list
  :param VpcSubnets: 

    A list of virtual private cloud (VPC) subnets to use with instances in the game server group. By default, all Amazon GameLift Servers FleetIQ-supported Availability Zones are used. You can use this parameter to specify VPCs that you've set up. This property cannot be updated after the game server group is created, and the corresponding Auto Scaling group will always use the property value that is set with this request, even if the Auto Scaling group is updated directly.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type Tags: list
  :param Tags: 

    A list of labels to assign to the new game server group resource. Tags are developer-defined key-value pairs. Tagging Amazon Web Services resources is useful for resource management, access management, and cost allocation. For more information, see `Tagging Amazon Web Services Resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      A label that you can assign to a Amazon GameLift Servers resource.
