.. py:method:: GameLift.Client.describe_fleet_utilization(**kwargs)

  

  **This API works with the following fleet types:** EC2, Container

   

  Retrieves utilization statistics for one or more fleets. Utilization data provides a snapshot of how the fleet's hosting resources are currently being used. For fleets with remote locations, this operation retrieves data for the fleet's home Region only. See `DescribeFleetLocationUtilization <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_DescribeFleetLocationUtilization.html>`__ to get utilization statistics for a fleet's remote locations.

   

  This operation can be used in the following ways:

   

  
  * To get utilization data for one or more specific fleets, provide a list of fleet IDs or fleet ARNs.
   
  * To get utilization data for all fleets, do not provide a fleet identifier.
  

   

  When requesting multiple fleets, use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages.

   

  If successful, a `FleetUtilization <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_FleetUtilization.html>`__ object is returned for each requested fleet ID, unless the fleet identifier is not found. Each fleet utilization object includes a ``Location`` property, which is set to the fleet's home Region.

   

  .. note::

    

    Some API operations may limit the number of fleet IDs allowed in one request. If a request exceeds this limit, the request fails and the error message includes the maximum allowed.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.describe_fleet_utilization(
        FleetIds=[
            'string',
        ],
        Limit=123,
        NextToken='string'
    )
    
  :type FleetIds: list
  :param FleetIds: 

    A unique identifier for the fleet to retrieve utilization data for. You can use either the fleet ID or ARN value. To retrieve attributes for all current fleets, do not include this parameter.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type Limit: integer
  :param Limit: 

    The maximum number of results to return. Use this parameter with ``NextToken`` to get results as a set of sequential pages. This parameter is ignored when the request specifies one or a list of fleet IDs.

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    A token that indicates the start of the next sequential page of results. Use the token that is returned with a previous call to this operation. To start at the beginning of the result set, do not specify a value. This parameter is ignored when the request specifies one or a list of fleet IDs.

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **FleetUtilization** *(list) --* 

        A collection of objects containing utilization information for each requested fleet ID. Utilization objects are returned only for fleets that currently exist.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          Current resource utilization statistics in a specified fleet or location. The location value might refer to a fleet's remote location or its home region.

          
          

          - **FleetId** *(string) --* 

            A unique identifier for the fleet associated with the location.

            
          

          - **FleetArn** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Name ( `ARN <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-arn-format.html>`__) that is assigned to a Amazon GameLift Servers fleet resource and uniquely identifies it. ARNs are unique across all Regions. Format is ``arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::fleet/fleet-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912``.

            
          

          - **ActiveServerProcessCount** *(integer) --* 

            The number of server processes in ``ACTIVE`` status that are currently running across all instances in the fleet location.

            
          

          - **ActiveGameSessionCount** *(integer) --* 

            The number of active game sessions that are currently being hosted across all instances in the fleet location.

            
          

          - **CurrentPlayerSessionCount** *(integer) --* 

            The number of active player sessions that are currently being hosted across all instances in the fleet location.

            
          

          - **MaximumPlayerSessionCount** *(integer) --* 

            The maximum number of players allowed across all game sessions that are currently being hosted across all instances in the fleet location.

      - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

        A token that indicates where to resume retrieving results on the next call to this operation. If no token is returned, these results represent the end of the list.
