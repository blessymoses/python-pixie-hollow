  :type Name: string
  :param Name: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A unique identifier for the matchmaking configuration to update. You can use either the configuration name or ARN value.

    

  
  :type Description: string
  :param Description: 

    A description for the matchmaking configuration.

    

  
  :type GameSessionQueueArns: list
  :param GameSessionQueueArns: 

    The Amazon Resource Name ( `ARN <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-arn-format.html>`__) that is assigned to a Amazon GameLift Servers game session queue resource and uniquely identifies it. ARNs are unique across all Regions. Format is ``arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::gamesessionqueue/<queue name>``. Queues can be located in any Region. Queues are used to start new Amazon GameLift Servers-hosted game sessions for matches that are created with this matchmaking configuration. If ``FlexMatchMode`` is set to ``STANDALONE``, do not set this parameter.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type RequestTimeoutSeconds: integer
  :param RequestTimeoutSeconds: 

    The maximum duration, in seconds, that a matchmaking ticket can remain in process before timing out. Requests that fail due to timing out can be resubmitted as needed.

    

  
  :type AcceptanceTimeoutSeconds: integer
  :param AcceptanceTimeoutSeconds: 

    The length of time (in seconds) to wait for players to accept a proposed match, if acceptance is required.

    

  
  :type AcceptanceRequired: boolean
  :param AcceptanceRequired: 

    A flag that indicates whether a match that was created with this configuration must be accepted by the matched players. To require acceptance, set to TRUE. With this option enabled, matchmaking tickets use the status ``REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE`` to indicate when a completed potential match is waiting for player acceptance.

    

  
  :type RuleSetName: string
  :param RuleSetName: 

    A unique identifier for the matchmaking rule set to use with this configuration. You can use either the rule set name or ARN value. A matchmaking configuration can only use rule sets that are defined in the same Region.

    

  
  :type NotificationTarget: string
  :param NotificationTarget: 

    An SNS topic ARN that is set up to receive matchmaking notifications. See `Setting up notifications for matchmaking <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/flexmatchguide/match-notification.html>`__ for more information.

    

  
  :type AdditionalPlayerCount: integer
  :param AdditionalPlayerCount: 

    The number of player slots in a match to keep open for future players. For example, if the configuration's rule set specifies a match for a single 12-person team, and the additional player count is set to 2, only 10 players are selected for the match. This parameter is not used if ``FlexMatchMode`` is set to ``STANDALONE``.

    

  
  :type CustomEventData: string
  :param CustomEventData: 

    Information to add to all events related to the matchmaking configuration.

    

  
  :type GameProperties: list
  :param GameProperties: 

    A set of key-value pairs that can store custom data in a game session. For example: ``{"Key": "difficulty", "Value": "novice"}``. This information is added to the new ``GameSession`` object that is created for a successful match. This parameter is not used if ``FlexMatchMode`` is set to ``STANDALONE``.

     

    .. note::

      

      Avoid using periods (".") in property keys if you plan to search for game sessions by properties. Property keys containing periods cannot be searched and will be filtered out from search results due to search index limitations.

      

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      This key-value pair can store custom data about a game session. For example, you might use a ``GameProperty`` to track a game session's map, level of difficulty, or remaining time. The difficulty level could be specified like this: ``{"Key": "difficulty", "Value":"Novice"}``.

       

      You can set game properties when creating a game session. You can also modify game properties of an active game session. When searching for game sessions, you can filter on game property keys and values. You can't delete game properties from a game session.

       

      For examples of working with game properties, see `Create a game session with properties <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-client-api.html#game-properties>`__.

      

    
      - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The game property identifier.

         

        .. note::

          

          Avoid using periods (".") in property keys if you plan to search for game sessions by properties. Property keys containing periods cannot be searched and will be filtered out from search results due to search index limitations.

          

        

      
      - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The game property value.

        

      
    

  :type GameSessionData: string
  :param GameSessionData: 

    A set of custom game session properties, formatted as a single string value. This data is passed to a game server process with a request to start a new game session. For more information, see `Start a game session <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-server-api.html#gamelift-sdk-server-startsession>`__. This information is added to the game session that is created for a successful match. This parameter is not used if ``FlexMatchMode`` is set to ``STANDALONE``.

    

  
  :type BackfillMode: string
  :param BackfillMode: 

    The method that is used to backfill game sessions created with this matchmaking configuration. Specify MANUAL when your game manages backfill requests manually or does not use the match backfill feature. Specify AUTOMATIC to have GameLift create a match backfill request whenever a game session has one or more open slots. Learn more about manual and automatic backfill in `Backfill Existing Games with FlexMatch <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/flexmatchguide/match-backfill.html>`__. Automatic backfill is not available when ``FlexMatchMode`` is set to ``STANDALONE``.

    

  
  :type FlexMatchMode: string
  :param FlexMatchMode: 

    Indicates whether this matchmaking configuration is being used with Amazon GameLift Servers hosting or as a standalone matchmaking solution.

     

    
    * **STANDALONE** - FlexMatch forms matches and returns match information, including players and team assignments, in a `MatchmakingSucceeded <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/flexmatchguide/match-events.html#match-events-matchmakingsucceeded>`__ event.
     
    * **WITH_QUEUE** - FlexMatch forms matches and uses the specified Amazon GameLift Servers queue to start a game session for the match.
