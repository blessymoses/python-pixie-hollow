.. py:method:: GameLift.Client.describe_scaling_policies(**kwargs)

  

  **This API works with the following fleet types:** EC2

   

  Retrieves all scaling policies applied to a fleet.

   

  To get a fleet's scaling policies, specify the fleet ID. You can filter this request by policy status, such as to retrieve only active scaling policies. Use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages. If successful, set of ``ScalingPolicy`` objects is returned for the fleet.

   

  A fleet may have all of its scaling policies suspended. This operation does not affect the status of the scaling policies, which remains ACTIVE.

        Location='string'
    )
    
  :type FleetId: string
  :param FleetId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A unique identifier for the fleet for which to retrieve scaling policies. You can use either the fleet ID or ARN value.

    

  
  :type StatusFilter: string
  :param StatusFilter: 

    Scaling policy status to filter results on. A scaling policy is only in force when in an ``ACTIVE`` status.

     

    
    * **ACTIVE** -- The scaling policy is currently in force.
     
    * **UPDATEREQUESTED** -- A request to update the scaling policy has been received.
     
    * **UPDATING** -- A change is being made to the scaling policy.
     
    * **DELETEREQUESTED** -- A request to delete the scaling policy has been received.
     
    * **DELETING** -- The scaling policy is being deleted.
     
    * **DELETED** -- The scaling policy has been deleted.
     
    * **ERROR** -- An error occurred in creating the policy. It should be removed and recreated.
    

    

  
  :type Limit: integer
  :param Limit: 

    The maximum number of results to return. Use this parameter with ``NextToken`` to get results as a set of sequential pages.

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    A token that indicates the start of the next sequential page of results. Use the token that is returned with a previous call to this operation. To start at the beginning of the result set, do not specify a value.

    

  
  :type Location: string
  :param Location:

        - *(dict) --* 

          Rule that controls how a fleet is scaled. Scaling policies are uniquely identified by the combination of name and fleet ID.

          
          

          - **FleetId** *(string) --* 

            A unique identifier for the fleet that is associated with this scaling policy.

            The Amazon Resource Name ( `ARN <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-arn-format.html>`__) that is assigned to a Amazon GameLift Servers fleet resource and uniquely identifies it. ARNs are unique across all Regions. Format is ``arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::fleet/fleet-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912``.

          - **Status** *(string) --* 

            Current status of the scaling policy. The scaling policy can be in force only when in an ``ACTIVE`` status. Scaling policies can be suspended for individual fleets. If the policy is suspended for a fleet, the policy status does not change.

            * **DELETED** -- The scaling policy has been deleted.
             
            * **ERROR** -- An error occurred in creating the policy. It should be removed and recreated.

            * **ExactCapacity** -- set the instance count to the scaling adjustment value.
             
            * **PercentChangeInCapacity** -- increase or reduce the current instance count by the scaling adjustment, read as a percentage. Positive values scale up while negative values scale down.
            

            
          

          - **ComparisonOperator** *(string) --* 

            Comparison operator to use when measuring a metric against the threshold value.

            Metric value used to trigger a scaling event.

            
          

          - **EvaluationPeriods** *(integer) --* 

            Length of time (in minutes) the metric must be at or beyond the threshold before a scaling event is triggered.

            
          

          - **MetricName** *(string) --* 

            Name of the Amazon GameLift Servers-defined metric that is used to trigger a scaling adjustment.

            * **PercentAvailableGameSessions** -- Unused percentage of the total number of game sessions that a fleet could host simultaneously, given current capacity. Use this metric for a target-based scaling policy.
             
            * **PercentIdleInstances** -- Percentage of the total number of active instances that are hosting zero game sessions.

            * **WaitTime** -- Current wait time for pending game session placement requests, in any queue, where the current fleet is the top-priority destination.
            

            
          

          - **PolicyType** *(string) --* 

            The type of scaling policy to create. For a target-based policy, set the parameter *MetricName* to 'PercentAvailableGameSessions' and specify a *TargetConfiguration*. For a rule-based policy set the following parameters: *MetricName*, *ComparisonOperator*, *Threshold*, *EvaluationPeriods*, *ScalingAdjustmentType*, and *ScalingAdjustment*.

            - **TargetValue** *(float) --* 

              Desired value to use with a target-based scaling policy. The value must be relevant for whatever metric the scaling policy is using. For example, in a policy using the metric PercentAvailableGameSessions, the target value should be the preferred size of the fleet's buffer (the percent of capacity that should be idle and ready for new game sessions).

              
        
          

          - **UpdateStatus** *(string) --* 

            The current status of the fleet's scaling policies in a requested fleet location. The status ``PENDING_UPDATE`` indicates that an update was requested for the fleet but has not yet been completed for the location.

            
          

          - **Location** *(string) --* 

            The fleet location.

            
      
    
      

      - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

        A token that indicates where to resume retrieving results on the next call to this operation. If no token is returned, these results represent the end of the list.
