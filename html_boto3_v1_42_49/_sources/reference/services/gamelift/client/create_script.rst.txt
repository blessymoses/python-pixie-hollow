.. py:method:: GameLift.Client.create_script(**kwargs)

  

  **This API works with the following fleet types:** EC2, Anywhere

   

  Creates a new script record for your Amazon GameLift Servers Realtime script. Realtime scripts are JavaScript that provide configuration settings and optional custom game logic for your game. The script is deployed when you create a Amazon GameLift Servers Realtime fleet to host your game sessions. Script logic is executed during an active game session.

   

  To create a new script record, specify a script name and provide the script file(s). The script files and all dependencies must be zipped into a single file. You can pull the zip file from either of these locations:

   

  
  * A locally available directory. Use the *ZipFile* parameter for this option.
   
  * An Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket under your Amazon Web Services account. Use the *StorageLocation* parameter for this option. You'll need to have an Identity Access Management (IAM) role that allows the Amazon GameLift Servers service to access your S3 bucket.
  

   

  If the call is successful, a new script record is created with a unique script ID. If the script file is provided as a local file, the file is uploaded to an Amazon GameLift Servers-owned S3 bucket and the script record's storage location reflects this location. If the script file is provided as an S3 bucket, Amazon GameLift Servers accesses the file at this storage location as needed for deployment.

  :type Name: string
  :param Name: 

    A descriptive label that is associated with a script. Script names do not need to be unique. You can use `UpdateScript <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_UpdateScript.html>`__ to change this value later.

    

  
  :type Version: string
  :param Version: 

    Version information that is associated with a build or script. Version strings do not need to be unique. You can use `UpdateScript <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_UpdateScript.html>`__ to change this value later.

    

  
  :type StorageLocation: dict
  :param StorageLocation: 

    The location of the Amazon S3 bucket where a zipped file containing your Realtime scripts is stored. The storage location must specify the Amazon S3 bucket name, the zip file name (the "key"), and a role ARN that allows Amazon GameLift Servers to access the Amazon S3 storage location. The S3 bucket must be in the same Region where you want to create a new script. By default, Amazon GameLift Servers uploads the latest version of the zip file; if you have S3 object versioning turned on, you can use the ``ObjectVersion`` parameter to specify an earlier version.

    

  
    - **Bucket** *(string) --* 

      An Amazon S3 bucket identifier. Thename of the S3 bucket.

       

      .. note::

        

        Amazon GameLift Servers doesn't support uploading from Amazon S3 buckets with names that contain a dot (.).

        

      

    
    - **Key** *(string) --* 

      The name of the zip file that contains the build files or script files.

      

    
    - **RoleArn** *(string) --* 

      The Amazon Resource Name ( `ARN <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-arn-format.html>`__) for an IAM role that allows Amazon GameLift Servers to access the S3 bucket.

      

    
    - **ObjectVersion** *(string) --* 

      The version of the file, if object versioning is turned on for the bucket. Amazon GameLift Servers uses this information when retrieving files from an S3 bucket that you own. Use this parameter to specify a specific version of the file. If not set, the latest version of the file is retrieved.

      

    
  
  :type ZipFile: bytes
  :param ZipFile: 

    A data object containing your Realtime scripts and dependencies as a zip file. The zip file can have one or multiple files. Maximum size of a zip file is 5 MB.

     

    When using the Amazon Web Services CLI tool to create a script, this parameter is set to the zip file name. It must be prepended with the string "fileb://" to indicate that the file data is a binary object. For example: ``--zip-file fileb://myRealtimeScript.zip``.

    

  
  :type Tags: list
  :param Tags: 

    A list of labels to assign to the new script resource. Tags are developer-defined key-value pairs. Tagging Amazon Web Services resources are useful for resource management, access management and cost allocation. For more information, see `Tagging Amazon Web Services Resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*. Once the resource is created, you can use `TagResource <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_TagResource.html>`__, `UntagResource <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_UntagResource.html>`__, and `ListTagsForResource <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_ListTagsForResource.html>`__ to add, remove, and view tags. The maximum tag limit may be lower than stated. See the Amazon Web Services General Reference for actual tagging limits.

    

  
    - *(dict) --*
