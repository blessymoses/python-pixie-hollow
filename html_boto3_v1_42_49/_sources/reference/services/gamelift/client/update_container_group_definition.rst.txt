.. py:method:: GameLift.Client.update_container_group_definition(**kwargs)

  

  **This API works with the following fleet types:** Container

   

  Updates properties in an existing container group definition. This operation doesn't replace the definition. Instead, it creates a new version of the definition and saves it separately. You can access all versions that you choose to retain.

   

  The only property you can't update is the container group type.

   

  **Request options:**

   

  
  * Update based on the latest version of the container group definition. Specify the container group definition name only, or use an ARN value without a version number. Provide updated values for the properties that you want to change only. All other values remain the same as the latest version.
   
  * Update based on a specific version of the container group definition. Specify the container group definition name and a source version number, or use an ARN value with a version number. Provide updated values for the properties that you want to change only. All other values remain the same as the source version.
   
  * Change a game server container definition. Provide the updated container definition.
   
  * Add or change a support container definition. Provide a complete set of container definitions, including the updated definition.
   
  * Remove a support container definition. Provide a complete set of container definitions, excluding the definition to remove. If the container group has only one support container definition, provide an empty set.
  

   

  **Results:**

   

  If successful, this operation returns the complete properties of the new container group definition version.

   

  If the container group definition version is used in an active fleets, the update automatically initiates a new fleet deployment of the new version. You can track a fleet's deployments using `ListFleetDeployments <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_ListFleetDeployments.html>`__.

  :type Name: string
  :param Name: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A descriptive identifier for the container group definition. The name value must be unique in an Amazon Web Services Region.

    

  
  :type GameServerContainerDefinition: dict
  :param GameServerContainerDefinition: 

    An updated definition for the game server container in this group. Define a game server container only when the container group type is ``GAME_SERVER``. You can pass in your container definitions as a JSON file.

    

  
    - **ContainerName** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      A string that uniquely identifies the container definition within a container group.

      

    
    - **DependsOn** *(list) --* 

      Establishes dependencies between this container and the status of other containers in the same container group. A container can have dependencies on multiple different containers.

       

      You can use dependencies to establish a startup/shutdown sequence across the container group. For example, you might specify that *ContainerB* has a ``START`` dependency on *ContainerA*. This dependency means that *ContainerB* can't start until after *ContainerA* has started. This dependency is reversed on shutdown, which means that *ContainerB* must shut down before *ContainerA* can shut down.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        A container's dependency on another container in the same container group. The dependency impacts how the dependent container is able to start or shut down based the status of the other container.

         

        For example, *ContainerA* is configured with the following dependency: a ``START`` dependency on *ContainerB*. This means that *ContainerA* can't start until *ContainerB* has started. It also means that *ContainerA* must shut down before *ContainerB*.

          * COMPLETE - The dependency container has run to completion (exits). Use this condition with nonessential containers, such as those that run a script and then exit. The dependency container can't be an essential container.
           
          * SUCCESS - The dependency container has run to completion and exited with a zero status. The dependency container can't be an essential container.
           
          * HEALTHY - The dependency container has passed its Docker health check. Use this condition with dependency containers that have health checks configured. This condition is confirmed at container group startup only.
          

          

        
      
  
    - **MountPoints** *(list) --*

      A set of ports that Amazon GameLift Servers can assign to processes in a container. The container port configuration must have enough ports for each container process that accepts inbound traffic connections. For example, a game server process requires a container port to allow game clients to connect to it. A container port configuration can have can have one or more container port ranges. Each range specifies starting and ending values as well as the supported network protocol.

        Configuration for a non-terminal health check. A container automatically restarts if it stops functioning. With a health check, you can define additional reasons to flag a container as unhealthy and restart it. If an essential container fails a health check, the entire container group restarts.

        

      
        - **Command** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          A string array that specifies the command that the container runs to determine if it's healthy.

          

        
          - *(string) --* 

          
      
        - **Interval** *(integer) --* 

          The time period (in seconds) between each health check.

          

        
        - **Retries** *(integer) --* 

          The number of times to retry a failed health check before flagging the container unhealthy. The first run of the command does not count as a retry.

          

        
        - **StartPeriod** *(integer) --* 

          The optional grace period (in seconds) to give a container time to bootstrap before the first failed health check counts toward the number of retries.

          

        
        - **Timeout** *(integer) --* 

          The time period (in seconds) to wait for a health check to succeed before counting a failed health check.

          

        
      
      - **ImageUri** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The location of the container image to deploy to a container fleet. Provide an image in an Amazon Elastic Container Registry public or private repository. The repository must be in the same Amazon Web Services account and Amazon Web Services Region where you're creating the container group definition. For limits on image size, see `Amazon GameLift Servers endpoints and quotas <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/gamelift.html>`__. You can use any of the following image URI formats:

         

        
        * Image ID only: ``[AWS account].dkr.ecr.[AWS region].amazonaws.com/[repository ID]``
         
        * Image ID and digest: ``[AWS account].dkr.ecr.[AWS region].amazonaws.com/[repository ID]@[digest]``
         
        * Image ID and tag: ``[AWS account].dkr.ecr.[AWS region].amazonaws.com/[repository ID]:[tag]``
        

        

      
      - **MemoryHardLimitMebibytes** *(integer) --* 

        A specified amount of memory (in MiB) to reserve for this container. If you don't specify a container-specific memory limit, the container shares the container group's total memory allocation.

         

        **Related data type:** `ContainerGroupDefinition <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_ContainerGroupDefinition.html>`__TotalMemoryLimitMebibytes

        

      
      - **PortConfiguration** *(dict) --* 

        A set of ports that Amazon GameLift Servers can assign to processes in a container. The container port configuration must have enough ports for each container process that accepts inbound traffic connections. A container port configuration can have can have one or more container port ranges. Each range specifies starting and ending values as well as the supported network protocol.

         

        Container ports aren't directly accessed by inbound traffic. Amazon GameLift Servers maps each container port to an externally accessible connection port (see the container fleet property ``ConnectionPortRange``).

        

      
        - **ContainerPortRanges** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          A set of one or more container port number ranges. The ranges can't overlap if the ranges' network protocols are the same. Overlapping ranges with different protocols is allowed but not recommended.

          

        
          - *(dict) --* 

            A set of one or more port numbers that can be opened on the container, and the supported network protocol.

             

            **Part of:** `ContainerPortConfiguration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_ContainerPortConfiguration.html>`__

              A starting value for the range of allowed port numbers.

              

            
            - **ToPort** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

              An ending value for the range of allowed port numbers. Port numbers are end-inclusive. This value must be equal to or greater than ``FromPort``.

              

            
            - **Protocol** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

              The network protocol that these ports support.

              

            
          
      
      
      - **Vcpu** *(float) --* 

        The number of vCPU units to reserve for this container. The container can use more resources when needed, if available. If you don't reserve CPU units for this container, it shares the container group's total vCPU limit.

            Indicates that the container relies on the status of other containers in the same container group during startup and shutdown sequences. A container might have dependencies on multiple containers.

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

              A container's dependency on another container in the same container group. The dependency impacts how the dependent container is able to start or shut down based the status of the other container.

               

              For example, *ContainerA* is configured with the following dependency: a ``START`` dependency on *ContainerB*. This means that *ContainerA* can't start until *ContainerB* has started. It also means that *ContainerA* must shut down before *ContainerB*.

        - **SupportContainerDefinitions** *(list) --* 

          The set of definitions for support containers in this group. A container group definition might have zero support container definitions. Support container can be used in any type of container group.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            Describes a support container in a container group. A support container might be in a game server container group or a per-instance container group. Support containers don't run game server processes.

             

            You can update a support container definition and deploy the updates to an existing fleet.

            - **DependsOn** *(list) --* 

              Indicates that the container relies on the status of other containers in the same container group during its startup and shutdown sequences. A container might have dependencies on multiple containers.

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                A container's dependency on another container in the same container group. The dependency impacts how the dependent container is able to start or shut down based the status of the other container.

                 

                For example, *ContainerA* is configured with the following dependency: a ``START`` dependency on *ContainerB*. This means that *ContainerA* can't start until *ContainerB* has started. It also means that *ContainerA* must shut down before *ContainerB*.
