.. py:method:: GameLift.Client.request_upload_credentials(**kwargs)

  

  **This API works with the following fleet types:** EC2

   

  Retrieves a fresh set of credentials for use when uploading a new set of game build files to Amazon GameLift Servers's Amazon S3. This is done as part of the build creation process; see `CreateBuild <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_CreateBuild.html>`__.

   

  To request new credentials, specify the build ID as returned with an initial ``CreateBuild`` request. If successful, a new set of credentials are returned, along with the S3 storage location associated with the build ID.
