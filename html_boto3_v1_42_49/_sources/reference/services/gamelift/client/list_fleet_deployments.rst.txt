.. py:method:: GameLift.Client.list_fleet_deployments(**kwargs)

  

  **This API works with the following fleet types:** Container

   

  Retrieves a collection of container fleet deployments in an Amazon Web Services Region. Use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages.

   

  **Request options**

   

  
  * Get a list of all deployments. Call this operation without specifying a fleet ID.
   
  * Get a list of all deployments for a fleet. Specify the container fleet ID or ARN value.
  

   

  **Results**

   

  If successful, this operation returns a list of deployments that match the request parameters. A NextToken value is also returned if there are more result pages to retrieve.

   

  .. note::

    

    Deployments are returned starting with the latest.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_fleet_deployments(
        FleetId='string',
        Limit=123,
        NextToken='string'
    )
    
  :type FleetId: string
  :param FleetId: 

    A unique identifier for the container fleet. You can use either the fleet ID or ARN value.

    

  
  :type Limit: integer
  :param Limit: 

    The maximum number of results to return. Use this parameter with ``NextToken`` to get results as a set of sequential pages.

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    A token that indicates the start of the next sequential page of results. Use the token that is returned with a previous call to this operation. To start at the beginning of the result set, do not specify a value.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **FleetDeployments** *(list) --* 

        The requested deployment information.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          Describes a container fleet deployment with updates to the fleet.

          
          

          - **DeploymentId** *(string) --* 

            A unique identifier for the deployment.

            
          

          - **FleetId** *(string) --* 

            A unique identifier for the container fleet.

            
          

          - **GameServerBinaryArn** *(string) --* 

            The unique identifier for the version of the game server container group definition that is being deployed.

            
          

          - **RollbackGameServerBinaryArn** *(string) --* 

            The unique identifier for the version of the game server container group definition to roll back to if deployment fails. Amazon GameLift Servers sets this property to the container group definition version that the fleet used when it was last active.

            
          

          - **PerInstanceBinaryArn** *(string) --* 

            The unique identifier for the version of the per-instance container group definition that is being deployed.

            
          

          - **RollbackPerInstanceBinaryArn** *(string) --* 

            The unique identifier for the version of the per-instance container group definition to roll back to if deployment fails. Amazon GameLift Servers sets this property to the container group definition version that the fleet used when it was last active.

            
          

          - **DeploymentStatus** *(string) --* 

            The status of fleet deployment activity in the location.

             

            
            * ``IN_PROGRESS`` -- The deployment is in progress.
             
            * ``IMPAIRED`` -- The deployment failed and the fleet has some impaired containers.
             
            * ``COMPLETE`` -- The deployment has completed successfully.
             
            * ``ROLLBACK_IN_PROGRESS`` -- The deployment failed and rollback has been initiated.
             
            * ``ROLLBACK_IN_COMPLETE`` -- The deployment failed and rollback has been completed.
             
            * ``CANCELLED`` -- The deployment was cancelled.
            

            
          

          - **DeploymentConfiguration** *(dict) --* 

            Instructions for how to deploy updates to a container fleet and what actions to take if the deployment fails.

            
            

            - **ProtectionStrategy** *(string) --* 

              Determines how fleet deployment activity affects active game sessions on the fleet. With protection, a deployment honors game session protection, and delays actions that would interrupt a protected active game session until the game session ends. Without protection, deployment activity can shut down all running tasks, including active game sessions, regardless of game session protection.

              
            

            - **MinimumHealthyPercentage** *(integer) --* 

              Sets a minimum level of healthy tasks to maintain during deployment activity.

              
            

            - **ImpairmentStrategy** *(string) --* 

              Determines what actions to take if a deployment fails. If the fleet is multi-location, this strategy applies across all fleet locations. With a rollback strategy, updated fleet instances are rolled back to the last successful deployment. Alternatively, you can maintain a few impaired containers for the purpose of debugging, while all other tasks return to the last successful deployment.

              
        
          

          - **CreationTime** *(datetime) --* 

            A time stamp indicating when this data object was created. Format is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for example ``"1469498468.057"``).

            
      
    
      

      - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

        A token that indicates where to resume retrieving results on the next call to this operation. If no token is returned, these results represent the end of the list.
