.. py:method:: GameLift.Client.describe_runtime_configuration(**kwargs)

  

  **This API works with the following fleet types:** EC2

   

  Retrieves a fleet's runtime configuration settings. The runtime configuration determines which server processes run, and how, on computes in the fleet. For managed EC2 fleets, the runtime configuration describes server processes that run on each fleet instance. You can update a fleet's runtime configuration at any time using `UpdateRuntimeConfiguration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_UpdateRuntimeConfiguration.html>`__.

   

  To get the current runtime configuration for a fleet, provide the fleet ID.

   

  If successful, a ``RuntimeConfiguration`` object is returned for the requested fleet. If the requested fleet has been deleted, the result set is empty.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **RuntimeConfiguration** *(dict) --* 

        Instructions that describe how server processes are launched and maintained on computes in the fleet.

        
        

        - **ServerProcesses** *(list) --* 

          A collection of server process configurations that identify what server processes to run on fleet computes.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            A set of instructions for launching server processes on fleet computes. Server processes run either an executable in a custom game build or a Amazon GameLift Servers Realtime script. Server process configurations are part of a fleet's runtime configuration.

            
            

            - **LaunchPath** *(string) --* 

              The location of a game build executable or Realtime script. Game builds and Realtime scripts are installed on instances at the root:

               

              
              * Windows (custom game builds only): ``C:\game``. Example: " ``C:\game\MyGame\server.exe``"
               
              * Linux: ``/local/game``. Examples: " ``/local/game/MyGame/server.exe``" or " ``/local/game/MyRealtimeScript.js``"
              

               

              .. note::

                

                Amazon GameLift Servers doesn't support the use of setup scripts that launch the game executable. For custom game builds, this parameter must indicate the executable that calls the server SDK operations ``initSDK()`` and ``ProcessReady()``.

                

              
            

            - **Parameters** *(string) --* 

              An optional list of parameters to pass to the server executable or Realtime script on launch.

              
            

            - **ConcurrentExecutions** *(integer) --* 

              The number of server processes using this configuration that run concurrently on each instance or compute.

              
        
      
        

        - **MaxConcurrentGameSessionActivations** *(integer) --* 

          The number of game sessions in status ``ACTIVATING`` to allow on an instance or compute. This setting limits the instance resources that can be used for new game activations at any one time.

          
        

        - **GameSessionActivationTimeoutSeconds** *(integer) --* 

          The maximum amount of time (in seconds) allowed to launch a new game session and have it report ready to host players. During this time, the game session is in status ``ACTIVATING``. If the game session does not become active before the timeout, it is ended and the game session status is changed to ``TERMINATED``.
