.. py:method:: GameLift.Client.create_vpc_peering_connection(**kwargs)

  

  **This API works with the following fleet types:** EC2

   

  Establishes a VPC peering connection between a virtual private cloud (VPC) in an Amazon Web Services account with the VPC for your Amazon GameLift Servers fleet. VPC peering enables the game servers on your fleet to communicate directly with other Amazon Web Services resources. You can peer with VPCs in any Amazon Web Services account that you have access to, including the account that you use to manage your Amazon GameLift Servers fleets. You cannot peer with VPCs that are in different Regions. For more information, see `VPC Peering with Amazon GameLift Servers Fleets <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/vpc-peering.html>`__.

   

  Before calling this operation to establish the peering connection, you first need to use `CreateVpcPeeringAuthorization <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_CreateVpcPeeringAuthorization.html>`__ and identify the VPC you want to peer with. Once the authorization for the specified VPC is issued, you have 24 hours to establish the connection. These two operations handle all tasks necessary to peer the two VPCs, including acceptance, updating routing tables, etc.

   

  To establish the connection, call this operation from the Amazon Web Services account that is used to manage the Amazon GameLift Servers fleets. Identify the following values: (1) The ID of the fleet you want to be enable a VPC peering connection for; (2) The Amazon Web Services account with the VPC that you want to peer with; and (3) The ID of the VPC you want to peer with. This operation is asynchronous. If successful, a connection request is created. You can use continuous polling to track the request's status using `DescribeVpcPeeringConnections <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_DescribeVpcPeeringConnections.html>`__ , or by monitoring fleet events for success or failure using `DescribeFleetEvents <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_DescribeFleetEvents.html>`__ .

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.create_vpc_peering_connection(
        FleetId='string',
        PeerVpcAwsAccountId='string',
        PeerVpcId='string'
    )
    
  :type FleetId: string
  :param FleetId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A unique identifier for the fleet. You can use either the fleet ID or ARN value. This tells Amazon GameLift Servers which GameLift VPC to peer with.

    

  
  :type PeerVpcAwsAccountId: string
  :param PeerVpcAwsAccountId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A unique identifier for the Amazon Web Services account with the VPC that you want to peer your Amazon GameLift Servers fleet with. You can find your Account ID in the Amazon Web Services Management Console under account settings.

    

  
  :type PeerVpcId: string
  :param PeerVpcId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A unique identifier for a VPC with resources to be accessed by your Amazon GameLift Servers fleet. The VPC must be in the same Region as your fleet. To look up a VPC ID, use the `VPC Dashboard <https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/>`__ in the Amazon Web Services Management Console.
