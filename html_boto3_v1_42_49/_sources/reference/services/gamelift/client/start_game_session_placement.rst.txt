.. py:method:: GameLift.Client.start_game_session_placement(**kwargs)

  

  **This API works with the following fleet types:** EC2, Anywhere, Container

   

  Makes a request to start a new game session using a game session queue. When processing a placement request, Amazon GameLift Servers looks for the best possible available resource to host the game session, based on how the queue is configured to prioritize factors such as resource cost, latency, and location. After selecting an available resource, Amazon GameLift Servers prompts the resource to start a game session. A placement request can include a list of players to create a set of player sessions. The request can also include information to pass to the new game session, such as to specify a game map or other options.

   

  **Request options**

   

  Use this operation to make the following types of requests.

   

  
  * Request a placement using the queue's default prioritization process (see the default prioritization described in `PriorityConfiguration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_PriorityConfiguration.html>`__). Include these required parameters: 

    
    * ``GameSessionQueueName``
     
    * ``MaximumPlayerSessionCount``
     
    * ``PlacementID``
    

  
   
  * Request a placement and prioritize based on latency. Include these parameters: 

    
    * Required parameters ``GameSessionQueueName``, ``MaximumPlayerSessionCount``, ``PlacementID``.
     
    * ``PlayerLatencies``. Include a set of latency values for destinations in the queue. When a request includes latency data, Amazon GameLift Servers automatically reorder the queue's locations priority list based on lowest available latency values. If a request includes latency data for multiple players, Amazon GameLift Servers calculates each location's average latency for all players and reorders to find the lowest latency across all players.
     
    * Don't include ``PriorityConfigurationOverride``.
    

   

    
    * Prioritize based on a custom list of locations. If you're using a queue that's configured to prioritize location first (see `PriorityConfiguration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_PriorityConfiguration.html>`__ for game session queues), you can optionally use the *PriorityConfigurationOverride* parameter to substitute a different location priority list for this placement request. Amazon GameLift Servers searches each location on the priority override list to find an available hosting resource for the new game session. Specify a fallback strategy to use in the event that Amazon GameLift Servers fails to place the game session in any of the locations on the override list.
    

  
   
  * Request a placement and prioritized based on a custom list of locations.
   
  * You can request new player sessions for a group of players. Include the *DesiredPlayerSessions* parameter and include at minimum a unique player ID for each. You can also include player-specific data to pass to the new game session.
  

   

  **Result**

   

  If successful, this operation generates a new game session placement request and adds it to the game session queue for processing. You can track the status of individual placement requests by calling `DescribeGameSessionPlacement <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_DescribeGameSessionPlacement.html>`__ or by monitoring queue notifications. When the request status is ``FULFILLED``, a new game session has started and the placement request is updated with connection information for the game session (IP address and port). If the request included player session data, Amazon GameLift Servers creates a player session for each player ID in the request.

   

  The request results in a ``InvalidRequestException`` in the following situations:

   

  
  * If the request includes both *PlayerLatencies* and *PriorityConfigurationOverride* parameters.
   
  * If the request includes the *PriorityConfigurationOverride* parameter and specifies a queue that doesn't prioritize locations.
  

   

  Amazon GameLift Servers continues to retry each placement request until it reaches the queue's timeout setting. If a request times out, you can resubmit the request to the same queue or try a different queue.

      You can set game properties when creating a game session. You can also modify game properties of an active game session. When searching for game sessions, you can filter on game property keys and values. You can't delete game properties from a game session.

      Regional latency information for a player, used when requesting a new game session. This value indicates the amount of time lag that exists when the player is connected to a fleet in the specified Region.

    - **LocationOrder** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      A prioritized list of hosting locations. The list can include Amazon Web Services Regions (such as ``us-west-2``), local zones, and custom locations (for Anywhere fleets).

          The IP address of the game session. To connect to a Amazon GameLift Servers game server, an app needs both the IP address and port number. This value isn't final until placement status is ``FULFILLED``.

          
        

        - **DnsName** *(string) --*

        - **Port** *(integer) --* 

          The port number for the game session. To connect to a Amazon GameLift Servers game server, an app needs both the IP address and port number. This value isn't final until placement status is ``FULFILLED``.

              A unique identifier for a player session.

              
        
      
        

        - **GameSessionData** *(string) --* 

          A set of custom game session properties, formatted as a single string value. This data is passed to a game server process with a request to start a new game session. For more information, see `Start a game session <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-server-api.html#gamelift-sdk-server-startsession>`__.

        - **PriorityConfigurationOverride** *(dict) --* 

          An alternative priority list of locations that's included with a game session placement request. When provided, the list overrides a queue's location order list for this game session placement request only. The list might include Amazon Web Services Regions, local zones, and custom locations (for Anywhere fleets). The fallback strategy tells Amazon GameLift Servers what action to take (if any) in the event that it failed to place a new game session.

          
          

          - **PlacementFallbackStrategy** *(string) --* 

            Instructions for how to proceed if placement fails in every location on the priority override list. Valid strategies include:

             

            
            * ``DEFAULT_AFTER_SINGLE_PASS`` -- After attempting to place a new game session in every location on the priority override list, try to place a game session in queue's other locations. This is the default behavior.
             
            * ``NONE`` -- Limit placements to locations on the priority override list only.
            

            
          

          - **LocationOrder** *(list) --* 

            A prioritized list of hosting locations. The list can include Amazon Web Services Regions (such as ``us-west-2``), local zones, and custom locations (for Anywhere fleets). Each location must be listed only once. For details, see `Amazon GameLift Servers service locations. <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-regions.html>`__
