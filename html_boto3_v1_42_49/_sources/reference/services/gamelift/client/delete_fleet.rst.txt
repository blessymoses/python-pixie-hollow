.. py:method:: GameLift.Client.delete_fleet(**kwargs)

  

  **This API works with the following fleet types:** EC2, Anywhere, Container

   

  Deletes all resources and information related to a fleet and shuts down any currently running fleet instances, including those in remote locations.

   

  .. note::

    

    If the fleet being deleted has a VPC peering connection, you first need to get a valid authorization (good for 24 hours) by calling `CreateVpcPeeringAuthorization <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_CreateVpcPeeringAuthorization.html>`__. You don't need to explicitly delete the VPC peering connection.

    

   

  To delete a fleet, specify the fleet ID to be terminated. During the deletion process, the fleet status is changed to ``DELETING``. When completed, the status switches to ``TERMINATED`` and the fleet event ``FLEET_DELETED`` is emitted.
