.. py:method:: GameLift.Client.update_fleet_port_settings(**kwargs)

  

  **This API works with the following fleet types:** EC2, Container

   

  Updates permissions that allow inbound traffic to connect to game sessions in the fleet.

   

  To update settings, specify the fleet ID to be updated and specify the changes to be made. List the permissions you want to add in ``InboundPermissionAuthorizations``, and permissions you want to remove in ``InboundPermissionRevocations``. Permissions to be removed must match existing fleet permissions.

   

  If successful, the fleet ID for the updated fleet is returned. For fleets with remote locations, port setting updates can take time to propagate across all locations. You can check the status of updates in each location by calling ``DescribeFleetPortSettings`` with a location name.

        ]
    )
    
  :type FleetId: string
  :param FleetId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A unique identifier for the fleet to update port settings for. You can use either the fleet ID or ARN value.

    

  
  :type InboundPermissionAuthorizations: list
  :param InboundPermissionAuthorizations: 

    A collection of port settings to be added to the fleet resource.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      A range of IP addresses and port settings that allow inbound traffic to connect to processes on an instance in a fleet. Processes are assigned an IP address/port number combination, which must fall into the fleet's allowed ranges.

       

      For Amazon GameLift Servers Realtime fleets, Amazon GameLift Servers automatically opens two port ranges, one for TCP messaging and one for UDP.

      

    
      - **FromPort** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        A starting value for a range of allowed port numbers.

         

        For fleets using Linux builds, only ports ``22`` and ``1026-60000`` are valid.

         

        For fleets using Windows builds, only ports ``1026-60000`` are valid.

        

      
      - **ToPort** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        An ending value for a range of allowed port numbers. Port numbers are end-inclusive. This value must be equal to or greater than ``FromPort``.

         

        For fleets using Linux builds, only ports ``22`` and ``1026-60000`` are valid.

         

        For fleets using Windows builds, only ports ``1026-60000`` are valid.

        

      
      - **IpRange** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        A range of allowed IP addresses. This value must be expressed in CIDR notation. Example: " ``000.000.000.000/[subnet mask]``" or optionally the shortened version " ``0.0.0.0/[subnet mask]``".

        

      
      - **Protocol** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The network communication protocol used by the fleet.

        

      
    

  :type InboundPermissionRevocations: list

    A collection of port settings to be removed from the fleet resource.
