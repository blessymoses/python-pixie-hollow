.. py:method:: GameLift.Client.list_locations(**kwargs)

  

  **This API works with the following fleet types:** Anywhere

   

  Lists all custom and Amazon Web Services locations where Amazon GameLift Servers can host game servers.

   

  Note that if you call this API using a location that doesn't have a service endpoint, such as one that can only be a remote location in a multi-location fleet, the API returns an error.

   

  Consult the table of supported locations in `Amazon GameLift Servers service locations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-regions.html>`__ to identify home Regions that support single and multi-location fleets.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_locations(
        Filters=[
            'AWS'|'CUSTOM',
        ],
        Limit=123,
        NextToken='string'
    )
    
  :type Filters: list
  :param Filters: 

    Filters the list for ``AWS`` or ``CUSTOM`` locations. Use this parameter to narrow down results to only Amazon Web Services-managed locations (Amazon EC2 or container) or only your custom locations (such as an Amazon GameLift Servers Anywhere fleet).

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type Limit: integer
  :param Limit: 

    The maximum number of results to return. Use this parameter with ``NextToken`` to get results as a set of sequential pages.

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    A token that indicates the start of the next sequential page of results. Use the token that is returned with a previous call to this operation. To start at the beginning of the result set, do not specify a value.

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **Locations** *(list) --* 

        A collection of locations, including both Amazon Web Services and custom locations. Each location includes a name and ping beacon information that can be used to measure network latency between player devices and the location.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          Properties of a location, which can include its name, ARN (for custom locations), and ping beacon information.

          
          

          - **LocationName** *(string) --* 

            The location's name.

            The Amazon Resource Name ( `ARN <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-arn-format.html>`__) that is assigned to a custom location resource and uniquely identifies it. ARNs are unique across all Regions. Format is ``arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::location/location-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912``.

            Information about the UDP ping beacon for this location.

            
            

            - **UDPEndpoint** *(dict) --* 

              The domain name and port of the UDP ping beacon.

              
              

              - **Domain** *(string) --* 

                The domain name of the UDP endpoint.
