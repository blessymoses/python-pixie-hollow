.. py:method:: GameLift.Client.describe_game_session_details(**kwargs)

  

  **This API works with the following fleet types:** EC2, Anywhere, Container

   

  Retrieves additional game session properties, including the game session protection policy in force, a set of one or more game sessions in a specific fleet location. You can optionally filter the results by current game session status.

   

  This operation can be used in the following ways:

   

  
  * To retrieve details for all game sessions that are currently running on all locations in a fleet, provide a fleet or alias ID, with an optional status filter. This approach returns details from the fleet's home Region and all remote locations.
   
  * To retrieve details for all game sessions that are currently running on a specific fleet location, provide a fleet or alias ID and a location name, with optional status filter. The location can be the fleet's home Region or any remote location.
   
  * To retrieve details for a specific game session, provide the game session ID. This approach looks for the game session ID in all fleets that reside in the Amazon Web Services Region defined in the request.
  

   

  Use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages.

   

  If successful, a ``GameSessionDetail`` object is returned for each game session that matches the request.

              .. note::

                

                Avoid using periods (".") in property keys if you plan to search for game sessions by properties. Property keys containing periods cannot be searched and will be filtered out from search results due to search index limitations.

                

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                This key-value pair can store custom data about a game session. For example, you might use a ``GameProperty`` to track a game session's map, level of difficulty, or remaining time. The difficulty level could be specified like this: ``{"Key": "difficulty", "Value":"Novice"}``.

                 

                You can set game properties when creating a game session. You can also modify game properties of an active game session. When searching for game sessions, you can filter on game property keys and values. You can't delete game properties from a game session.

                 

                For examples of working with game properties, see `Create a game session with properties <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-client-api.html#game-properties>`__.

                
                

                - **Key** *(string) --* 

                  The game property identifier.

                   

                  .. note::

                    

                    Avoid using periods (".") in property keys if you plan to search for game sessions by properties. Property keys containing periods cannot be searched and will be filtered out from search results due to search index limitations.

                    

                  
                

                - **Value** *(string) --*

            - **IpAddress** *(string) --* 

              The IP address of the game session. To connect to a Amazon GameLift Servers game server, an app needs both the IP address and port number.

              
            

            - **DnsName** *(string) --* 

              The DNS identifier assigned to the instance that is running the game session. Values have the following format:

               

              
              * TLS-enabled fleets: ``<unique identifier>.<region identifier>.amazongamelift.com``.
               
              * Non-TLS-enabled fleets: ``ec2-<unique identifier>.compute.amazonaws.com``. (See `Amazon EC2 Instance IP Addressing <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-instance-addressing.html#concepts-public-addresses>`__.)
              

               

              When connecting to a game session that is running on a TLS-enabled fleet, you must use the DNS name, not the IP address.

              
            

            - **Port** *(integer) --*

            - **CreatorId** *(string) --* 

              A unique identifier for a player. This ID is used to enforce a resource protection policy (if one exists), that limits the number of game sessions a player can create.

              
            

            - **GameSessionData** *(string) --* 

              A set of custom game session properties, formatted as a single string value. This data is passed to a game server process with a request to start a new game session. For more information, see `Start a game session <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-server-api.html#gamelift-sdk-server-startsession>`__.

              
            

            - **MatchmakerData** *(string) --* 

              Information about the matchmaking process that resulted in the game session, if matchmaking was used. Data is in JSON syntax, formatted as a string. Information includes the matchmaker ID as well as player attributes and team assignments. For more details on matchmaker data, see `Match Data <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/flexmatchguide/match-server.html#match-server-data>`__. Matchmaker data is updated whenever new players are added during a successful backfill (see `StartMatchBackfill <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_StartMatchBackfill.html>`__).

              
            

            - **Location** *(string) --* 

              The fleet location where the game session is running. This value might specify the fleet's home Region or a remote location. Location is expressed as an Amazon Web Services Region code such as ``us-west-2``.

              
        
          

          - **ProtectionPolicy** *(string) --* 

            Current status of protection for the game session.

             

            
            * **NoProtection** -- The game session can be terminated during a scale-down event.
             
            * **FullProtection** -- If the game session is in an ``ACTIVE`` status, it cannot be terminated during a scale-down event.
            

            
      
    
      

      - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

        A token that indicates where to resume retrieving results on the next call to this operation. If no token is returned, these results represent the end of the list.
