.. py:method:: GameLift.Client.create_container_fleet(**kwargs)

  

  **This API works with the following fleet types:** Container

   

  Creates a managed fleet of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances to host your containerized game servers. Use this operation to define how to deploy a container architecture onto each fleet instance and configure fleet settings. You can create a container fleet in any Amazon Web Services Regions that Amazon GameLift Servers supports for multi-location fleets. A container fleet can be deployed to a single location or multiple locations. Container fleets are deployed with Amazon Linux 2023 as the instance operating system.

   

  Define the fleet's container architecture using container group definitions. Each fleet can have one of the following container group types:

   

  
  * The game server container group runs your game server build and dependent software. Amazon GameLift Servers deploys one or more replicas of this container group to each fleet instance. The number of replicas depends on the computing capabilities of the fleet instance in use.
   
  * An optional per-instance container group might be used to run other software that only needs to run once per instance, such as background services, logging, or test processes. One per-instance container group is deployed to each fleet instance.
  

   

  Each container group can include the definition for one or more containers. A container definition specifies a container image that is stored in an Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) public or private repository.

   

  **Request options**

   

  Use this operation to make the following types of requests. Most fleet settings have default values, so you can create a working fleet with a minimal configuration and default values, which you can customize later.

   

  
  * Create a fleet with no container groups. You can configure a container fleet and then add container group definitions later. In this scenario, no fleet instances are deployed, and the fleet can't host game sessions until you add a game server container group definition. Provide the following required parameter values: 

    
    * ``FleetRoleArn``
    

  
   
  * Create a fleet with a game server container group. Provide the following required parameter values: 

    
    * ``FleetRoleArn``
     
    * ``GameServerContainerGroupDefinitionName``
    

  
   
  * Create a fleet with a game server container group and a per-instance container group. Provide the following required parameter values: 

    
    * ``FleetRoleArn``
     
    * ``GameServerContainerGroupDefinitionName``
     
    * ``PerInstanceContainerGroupDefinitionName``
    

  
  

   

  **Results**

   

  If successful, this operation creates a new container fleet resource, places it in ``PENDING`` status, and initiates the `fleet creation workflow <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/fleets-creating-all.html#fleets-creation-workflow>`__. For fleets with container groups, this workflow starts a fleet deployment and transitions the status to ``ACTIVE``. Fleets without a container group are placed in ``CREATED`` status.

   

  You can update most of the properties of a fleet, including container group definitions, and deploy the update across all fleet instances. Use `UpdateContainerFleet <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_UpdateContainerFleet.html>`__ to deploy a new game server version update across the container fleet.

   

  .. note::

    

    A managed fleet's runtime environment depends on the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) version it uses. When a new fleet is created, Amazon GameLift Servers assigns the latest available AMI version to the fleet, and all compute instances in that fleet are deployed with that version. To update the AMI version, you must create a new fleet. As a best practice, we recommend replacing your managed fleets every 30 days to maintain a secure and up-to-date runtime environment for your hosted game servers. For guidance, see `Security best practices for Amazon GameLift Servers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftservers/latest/developerguide/security-best-practices.html>`__.

You can't change this fleet property after the fleet is created.

     

    IAM role ARN values use the following pattern: ``arn:aws:iam::[Amazon Web Services account]:role/[role name]``.

    

  
  :type Description: string
  :param Description: 

    A meaningful description of the container fleet.

    

  
  :type GameServerContainerGroupDefinitionName: string
  :param GameServerContainerGroupDefinitionName: 

    A container group definition resource that describes how to deploy containers with your game server build and support software onto each fleet instance. You can specify the container group definition's name to use the latest version. Alternatively, provide an ARN value with a specific version number.

     

    Create a container group definition by calling `CreateContainerGroupDefinition <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_CreateContainerGroupDefinition.html>`__. This operation creates a `ContainerGroupDefinition <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_ContainerGroupDefinition.html>`__ resource.

    

  
  :type PerInstanceContainerGroupDefinitionName: string
  :param PerInstanceContainerGroupDefinitionName: 

    The name of a container group definition resource that describes a set of axillary software. A fleet instance has one process for executables in this container group. A per-instance container group is optional. You can update the fleet to add or remove a per-instance container group at any time. You can specify the container group definition's name to use the latest version. Alternatively, provide an ARN value with a specific version number.

     

    Create a container group definition by calling `https\://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_CreateContainerGroupDefinition.html <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_CreateContainerGroupDefinition.html>`__.

  :type InstanceConnectionPortRange: dict
  :param InstanceConnectionPortRange: 

    The set of port numbers to open on each fleet instance. A fleet's connection ports map to container ports that are configured in the fleet's container group definitions.

     

    By default, Amazon GameLift Servers calculates an optimal port range based on your fleet configuration. To use the calculated range, don't set this parameter. The values are:

     

    
    * Port range: 4192 to a number calculated based on your fleet configuration. Amazon GameLift Servers uses the following formula: ``4192 + [# of game server container groups per fleet instance] * [# of container ports in the game server container group definition] + [# of container ports in the game server container group definition]``
    

     

    You can also choose to manually set this parameter. When manually setting this parameter, you must use port numbers that match the fleet's inbound permissions port range.

     

    .. note::

      

      If you set values manually, Amazon GameLift Servers no longer calculates a port range for you, even if you later remove the manual settings.

      

    

  
    - **FromPort** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      Starting value for the port range.

  :type InstanceInboundPermissions: list
  :param InstanceInboundPermissions: 

    The IP address ranges and port settings that allow inbound traffic to access game server processes and other processes on this fleet. As a best practice, when remotely accessing a fleet instance, we recommend opening ports only when you need them and closing them when you're finished.

     

    By default, Amazon GameLift Servers calculates an optimal port range based on your fleet configuration. To use the calculated range, don't set this parameter. The values are:

     

    
    * Protocol: UDP
     
    * Port range: 4192 to a number calculated based on your fleet configuration. Amazon GameLift Servers uses the following formula: ``4192 + [# of game server container groups per fleet instance] * [# of container ports in the game server container group definition] + [# of container ports in the game server container group definition]``
    

     

    You can also choose to manually set this parameter. When manually setting this parameter, you must use port numbers that match the fleet's connection port range.

     

    .. note::

      

      If you set values manually, Amazon GameLift Servers no longer calculates a port range for you, even if you later remove the manual settings.

      

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      A range of IP addresses and port settings that allow inbound traffic to connect to processes on an instance in a fleet. Processes are assigned an IP address/port number combination, which must fall into the fleet's allowed ranges.

      - **Protocol** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The network communication protocol used by the fleet.

        

      
    

  :type GameServerContainerGroupsPerInstance: integer
  :param GameServerContainerGroupsPerInstance: 

    The number of times to replicate the game server container group on each fleet instance.

     

    By default, Amazon GameLift Servers calculates the maximum number of game server container groups that can fit on each instance. This calculation is based on the CPU and memory resources of the fleet's instance type). To use the calculated maximum, don't set this parameter. If you set this number manually, Amazon GameLift Servers uses your value as long as it's less than the calculated maximum.

    

  
  :type InstanceType: string
  :param InstanceType: 

    The Amazon EC2 instance type to use for all instances in the fleet. For multi-location fleets, the instance type must be available in the home region and all remote locations. Instance type determines the computing resources and processing power that's available to host your game servers. This includes including CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity.

     

    By default, Amazon GameLift Servers selects an instance type that fits the needs of your container groups and is available in all selected fleet locations. You can also choose to manually set this parameter. See `Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud Instance Types <http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/>`__ for detailed descriptions of Amazon EC2 instance types.

     

    You can't update this fleet property later.

    

  
  :type BillingType: string
  :param BillingType: 

    Indicates whether to use On-Demand or Spot instances for this fleet. Learn more about when to use `On-Demand versus Spot Instances <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-ec2-instances.html#gamelift-ec2-instances-spot>`__. This fleet property can't be changed after the fleet is created.

     

    By default, this property is set to ``ON_DEMAND``.

     

    You can't update this fleet property later.

    

  
  :type Locations: list
  :param Locations: 

    A set of locations to deploy container fleet instances to. You can add any Amazon Web Services Region or Local Zone that's supported by Amazon GameLift Servers. Provide a list of one or more Amazon Web Services Region codes, such as ``us-west-2``, or Local Zone names. Also include the fleet's home Region, which is the Amazon Web Services Region where the fleet is created. For a list of supported Regions and Local Zones, see `Amazon GameLift Servers service locations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-regions.html>`__ for managed hosting.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      A remote location where a multi-location fleet can deploy game servers for game hosting.

      

    
      - **Location** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        An Amazon Web Services Region code, such as ``us-west-2``. For a list of supported Regions and Local Zones, see `Amazon GameLift Servers service locations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-regions.html>`__ for managed hosting.

        

      
    

  :type MetricGroups: list
  :param MetricGroups: 

    The name of an Amazon Web Services CloudWatch metric group to add this fleet to. You can use a metric group to aggregate metrics for multiple fleets. You can specify an existing metric group name or use a new name to create a new metric group. Each fleet can have only one metric group, but you can change this value at any time.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type NewGameSessionProtectionPolicy: string
  :param NewGameSessionProtectionPolicy: 

    Determines whether Amazon GameLift Servers can shut down game sessions on the fleet that are actively running and hosting players. Amazon GameLift Servers might prompt an instance shutdown when scaling down fleet capacity or when retiring unhealthy instances. You can also set game session protection for individual game sessions using `UpdateGameSession <gamelift/latest/apireference/API_UpdateGameSession.html>`__.

     

    
    * **NoProtection** -- Game sessions can be shut down during active gameplay.
     
    * **FullProtection** -- Game sessions in ``ACTIVE`` status can't be shut down.
    

     

    By default, this property is set to ``NoProtection``.

    

  
  :type GameSessionCreationLimitPolicy: dict
  :param GameSessionCreationLimitPolicy: 

    A policy that limits the number of game sessions that each individual player can create on instances in this fleet. The limit applies for a specified span of time.

    

  
    - **NewGameSessionsPerCreator** *(integer) --* 

      A policy that puts limits on the number of game sessions that a player can create within a specified span of time. With this policy, you can control players' ability to consume available resources.

       

      The policy evaluates when a player tries to create a new game session. On receiving a ``CreateGameSession`` request, Amazon GameLift Servers checks that the player (identified by ``CreatorId``) has created fewer than game session limit in the specified time period.

      

    
    - **PolicyPeriodInMinutes** *(integer) --* 

      The time span used in evaluating the resource creation limit policy.

      

    
  
  :type LogConfiguration: dict
  :param LogConfiguration: 

    A method for collecting container logs for the fleet. Amazon GameLift Servers saves all standard output for each container in logs, including game session logs. You can select from the following methods:

     

    
    * ``CLOUDWATCH`` -- Send logs to an Amazon CloudWatch log group that you define. Each container emits a log stream, which is organized in the log group.
     
    * ``S3`` -- Store logs in an Amazon S3 bucket that you define.
     
    * ``NONE`` -- Don't collect container logs.
    

     

    By default, this property is set to ``CLOUDWATCH``.

     

    Amazon GameLift Servers requires permissions to send logs other Amazon Web Services services in your account. These permissions are included in the IAM fleet role for this container fleet (see ``FleetRoleArn)``.

    

  
    - **LogDestination** *(string) --* 

      The type of log collection to use for a fleet.

       

      
      * ``CLOUDWATCH`` -- (default value) Send logs to an Amazon CloudWatch log group that you define. Each container emits a log stream, which is organized in the log group.
       
      * ``S3`` -- Store logs in an Amazon S3 bucket that you define. This bucket must reside in the fleet's home Amazon Web Services Region.
       
      * ``NONE`` -- Don't collect container logs.
      

      

    
    - **S3BucketName** *(string) --* 

      If log destination is ``S3``, logs are sent to the specified Amazon S3 bucket name.

      

    
    - **LogGroupArn** *(string) --* 

      If log destination is ``CLOUDWATCH``, logs are sent to the specified log group in Amazon CloudWatch.
