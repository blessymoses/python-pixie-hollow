.. py:method:: GameLift.Client.create_build(**kwargs)

  

  **This API works with the following fleet types:** EC2, Anywhere

   

  Creates a new Amazon GameLift Servers build resource for your game server binary files. Combine game server binaries into a zip file for use with Amazon GameLift Servers.

   

  .. warning::

     

    When setting up a new game build for Amazon GameLift Servers, we recommend using the CLI command `upload-build <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/gamelift/upload-build.html>`__ . This helper command combines two tasks: (1) it uploads your build files from a file directory to an Amazon GameLift Servers Amazon S3 location, and (2) it creates a new build resource.

     

   

  You can use the ``CreateBuild`` operation in the following scenarios:

   

  
  * Create a new game build with build files that are in an Amazon S3 location under an Amazon Web Services account that you control. To use this option, you give Amazon GameLift Servers access to the Amazon S3 bucket. With permissions in place, specify a build name, operating system, and the Amazon S3 storage location of your game build.
   
  * Upload your build files to a Amazon GameLift Servers Amazon S3 location. To use this option, specify a build name and operating system. This operation creates a new build resource and also returns an Amazon S3 location with temporary access credentials. Use the credentials to manually upload your build files to the specified Amazon S3 location. For more information, see `Uploading Objects <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UploadingObjects.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 Developer Guide*. After you upload build files to the Amazon GameLift Servers Amazon S3 location, you can't update them.
  

   

  If successful, this operation creates a new build resource with a unique build ID and places it in ``INITIALIZED`` status. A build must be in ``READY`` status before you can create fleets with it.

  :type Name: string
  :param Name: 

    A descriptive label that is associated with a build. Build names do not need to be unique. You can change this value later.

    

  
  :type Version: string
  :param Version: 

    Version information that is associated with a build or script. Version strings do not need to be unique. You can change this value later.

    

  
  :type StorageLocation: dict
  :param StorageLocation: 

    Information indicating where your game build files are stored. Use this parameter only when creating a build with files stored in an Amazon S3 bucket that you own. The storage location must specify an Amazon S3 bucket name and key. The location must also specify a role ARN that you set up to allow Amazon GameLift Servers to access your Amazon S3 bucket. The S3 bucket and your new build must be in the same Region.

     

    If a ``StorageLocation`` is specified, the size of your file can be found in your Amazon S3 bucket. Amazon GameLift Servers will report a ``SizeOnDisk`` of 0.

    

  
    - **Bucket** *(string) --* 

      An Amazon S3 bucket identifier. Thename of the S3 bucket.

       

      .. note::

        

        Amazon GameLift Servers doesn't support uploading from Amazon S3 buckets with names that contain a dot (.).

        

      

    
    - **Key** *(string) --* 

      The name of the zip file that contains the build files or script files.

      

    
    - **RoleArn** *(string) --* 

      The Amazon Resource Name ( `ARN <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-arn-format.html>`__) for an IAM role that allows Amazon GameLift Servers to access the S3 bucket.

      

    
    - **ObjectVersion** *(string) --* 

      The version of the file, if object versioning is turned on for the bucket. Amazon GameLift Servers uses this information when retrieving files from an S3 bucket that you own. Use this parameter to specify a specific version of the file. If not set, the latest version of the file is retrieved.

      

    
  
  :type OperatingSystem: string
  :param OperatingSystem: 

    The operating system that your game server binaries run on. This value determines the type of fleet resources that you use for this build. If your game build contains multiple executables, they all must run on the same operating system. You must specify a valid operating system in this request. There is no default value. You can't change a build's operating system later.

     

    .. note::

      

      Amazon Linux 2 (AL2) will reach end of support on 6/30/2026. See more details in the `Amazon Linux 2 FAQs <http://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-2/faqs/>`__. For game servers that are hosted on AL2 and use server SDK version 4.x for Amazon GameLift Servers, first update the game server build to server SDK 5.x, and then deploy to AL2023 instances. See `Migrate to server SDK version 5. <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/reference-serversdk5-migration.html>`__

For game servers that are hosted on Windows Server 2016 and use server SDK version 4.x for Amazon GameLift Servers, first update the game server build to server SDK 5.x, and then deploy to Windows Server 2022 instances. See `Migrate to server SDK version 5. <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/reference-serversdk5-migration.html>`__

      

    

  
  :type Tags: list
  :param Tags: 

    A list of labels to assign to the new build resource. Tags are developer defined key-value pairs.
