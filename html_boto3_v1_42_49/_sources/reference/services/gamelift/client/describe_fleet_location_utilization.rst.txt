.. py:method:: GameLift.Client.describe_fleet_location_utilization(**kwargs)

  

  **This API works with the following fleet types:** EC2, Anywhere, Container

   

  Retrieves current usage data for a fleet location. Utilization data provides a snapshot of current game hosting activity at the requested location. Use this operation to retrieve utilization information for a fleet's remote location or home Region (you can also retrieve home Region utilization by calling ``DescribeFleetUtilization``).

   

  To retrieve utilization data, identify a fleet and location.

   

  If successful, a ``FleetUtilization`` object is returned for the requested fleet location.
