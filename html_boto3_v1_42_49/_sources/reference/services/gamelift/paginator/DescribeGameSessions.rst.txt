      **Response Structure**

      

      - *(dict) --* 
        

        - **GameSessions** *(list) --* 

          A collection of properties for each game session that matches the request.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            Properties describing a game session.

             

            A game session in ACTIVE status can host players. When a game session ends, its status is set to ``TERMINATED``.

             

            Amazon GameLift Servers retains a game session resource for 30 days after the game session ends. You can reuse idempotency token values after this time. Game session logs are retained for 14 days.

            - **StatusReason** *(string) --* 

              Provides additional information about game session status.

               

              
              * ``INTERRUPTED`` -- The game session was hosted on an EC2 Spot instance that was reclaimed, causing the active game session to be stopped.
               
              * ``TRIGGERED_ON_PROCESS_TERMINATE`` – The game session was stopped by calling ``TerminateGameSession`` with the termination mode ``TRIGGER_ON_PROCESS_TERMINATE``.
               
              * ``FORCE_TERMINATED`` – The game session was stopped by calling ``TerminateGameSession`` with the termination mode ``FORCE_TERMINATE``.
              

              
            

            - **GameProperties** *(list) --* 

              A set of key-value pairs that can store custom data in a game session. For example: ``{"Key": "difficulty", "Value": "novice"}``.

               

              .. note::

                

                Avoid using periods (".") in property keys if you plan to search for game sessions by properties. Property keys containing periods cannot be searched and will be filtered out from search results due to search index limitations.

                

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                This key-value pair can store custom data about a game session. For example, you might use a ``GameProperty`` to track a game session's map, level of difficulty, or remaining time. The difficulty level could be specified like this: ``{"Key": "difficulty", "Value":"Novice"}``.

                 

                You can set game properties when creating a game session. You can also modify game properties of an active game session. When searching for game sessions, you can filter on game property keys and values. You can't delete game properties from a game session.

                 

                For examples of working with game properties, see `Create a game session with properties <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-client-api.html#game-properties>`__.

                
                

                - **Key** *(string) --* 

                  The game property identifier.

                   

                  .. note::

                    

                    Avoid using periods (".") in property keys if you plan to search for game sessions by properties. Property keys containing periods cannot be searched and will be filtered out from search results due to search index limitations.

                    

                  
                

                - **Value** *(string) --* 

                  The game property value.

                  
            
          
            

            - **IpAddress** *(string) --* 

              The IP address of the game session. To connect to a Amazon GameLift Servers game server, an app needs both the IP address and port number.

              
            

            - **DnsName** *(string) --* 

              The DNS identifier assigned to the instance that is running the game session. Values have the following format:

               

              
              * TLS-enabled fleets: ``<unique identifier>.<region identifier>.amazongamelift.com``.
               
              * Non-TLS-enabled fleets: ``ec2-<unique identifier>.compute.amazonaws.com``. (See `Amazon EC2 Instance IP Addressing <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-instance-addressing.html#concepts-public-addresses>`__.)
              

               

              When connecting to a game session that is running on a TLS-enabled fleet, you must use the DNS name, not the IP address.

              
            

            - **Port** *(integer) --* 

              The port number for the game session. To connect to a Amazon GameLift Servers game server, an app needs both the IP address and port number.

              
            

            - **PlayerSessionCreationPolicy** *(string) --* 

              Indicates whether the game session is accepting new players.

              
            

            - **CreatorId** *(string) --* 

              A unique identifier for a player. This ID is used to enforce a resource protection policy (if one exists), that limits the number of game sessions a player can create.

              
            

            - **GameSessionData** *(string) --* 

              A set of custom game session properties, formatted as a single string value. This data is passed to a game server process with a request to start a new game session. For more information, see `Start a game session <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-server-api.html#gamelift-sdk-server-startsession>`__.

              
            

            - **MatchmakerData** *(string) --* 

              Information about the matchmaking process that resulted in the game session, if matchmaking was used. Data is in JSON syntax, formatted as a string. Information includes the matchmaker ID as well as player attributes and team assignments. For more details on matchmaker data, see `Match Data <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/flexmatchguide/match-server.html#match-server-data>`__. Matchmaker data is updated whenever new players are added during a successful backfill (see `StartMatchBackfill <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_StartMatchBackfill.html>`__).

              
            

            - **Location** *(string) --* 

              The fleet location where the game session is running. This value might specify the fleet's home Region or a remote location. Location is expressed as an Amazon Web Services Region code such as ``us-west-2``.
