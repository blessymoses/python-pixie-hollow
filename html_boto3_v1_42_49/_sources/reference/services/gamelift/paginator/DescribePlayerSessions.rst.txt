    :type GameSessionId: string
    :param GameSessionId: 

      A unique identifier for the game session to retrieve player sessions for.

      

    
    :type PlayerId: string
    :param PlayerId: 

      A unique identifier for a player to retrieve player sessions for.

      

    
    :type PlayerSessionId: string
    :param PlayerSessionId: 

      A unique identifier for a player session to retrieve.

      

    
    :type PlayerSessionStatusFilter: string
    :param PlayerSessionStatusFilter: 

      Player session status to filter results on. Note that when a PlayerSessionId or PlayerId is provided in a DescribePlayerSessions request, then the PlayerSessionStatusFilter has no effect on the response.

       

      Possible player session statuses include the following:

       

      
      * **RESERVED** -- The player session request has been received, but the player has not yet connected to the server process and/or been validated.
       
      * **ACTIVE** -- The player has been validated by the server process and is currently connected.
       
      * **COMPLETED** -- The player connection has been dropped.
       
      * **TIMEDOUT** -- A player session request was received, but the player did not connect and/or was not validated within the timeout limit (60 seconds).
      

      

    
    :type PaginationConfig: dict
    :param PaginationConfig: 

      A dictionary that provides parameters to control pagination.

      

    
      - **MaxItems** *(integer) --* 

        The total number of items to return. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified in max-items then a ``NextToken`` will be provided in the output that you can use to resume pagination.

        

      
      - **PageSize** *(integer) --* 

        The size of each page.

        

      
      - **StartingToken** *(string) --* 

        A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previous response.

      **Response Structure**

      

      - *(dict) --* 
        

        - **PlayerSessions** *(list) --* 

          A collection of objects containing properties for each player session that matches the request.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            Represents a player session. Player sessions are created either for a specific game session, or as part of a game session placement or matchmaking request. A player session can represents a reserved player slot in a game session (when status is ``RESERVED``) or actual player activity in a game session (when status is ``ACTIVE``). A player session object, including player data, is automatically passed to a game session when the player connects to the game session and is validated. After the game session ends, player sessions information is retained for 30 days and then removed.

              The Amazon Resource Name ( `ARN <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-arn-format.html>`__) associated with the GameLift fleet that the player's game session is running on.

              
            

            - **CreationTime** *(datetime) --* 

              A time stamp indicating when this data object was created. Format is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for example ``"1469498468.057"``).

              
            

            - **TerminationTime** *(datetime) --* 

              A time stamp indicating when this data object was terminated. Format is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for example ``"1469498468.057"``).

              
            

            - **Status** *(string) --* 

              Current status of the player session.

               

              Possible player session statuses include the following:

               

              
              * **RESERVED** -- The player session request has been received, but the player has not yet connected to the server process and/or been validated.
               
              * **ACTIVE** -- The player has been validated by the server process and is currently connected.
               
              * **COMPLETED** -- The player connection has been dropped.
               
              * **TIMEDOUT** -- A player session request was received, but the player did not connect and/or was not validated within the timeout limit (60 seconds).
              

              
            

            - **IpAddress** *(string) --* 

              The IP address of the game session. To connect to a Amazon GameLift Servers game server, an app needs both the IP address and port number.

              
            

            - **DnsName** *(string) --* 

              The DNS identifier assigned to the instance that is running the game session. Values have the following format:

              When connecting to a game session that is running on a TLS-enabled fleet, you must use the DNS name, not the IP address.

              
            

            - **Port** *(integer) --* 

              Port number for the game session. To connect to a Amazon GameLift Servers server process, an app needs both the IP address and port number.

              
            

            - **PlayerData** *(string) --* 

              Developer-defined information related to a player. Amazon GameLift Servers does not use this data, so it can be formatted as needed for use in the game.
