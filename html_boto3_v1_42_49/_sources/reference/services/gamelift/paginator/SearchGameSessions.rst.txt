      response_iterator = paginator.paginate(
          FleetId='string',
          AliasId='string',
          Location='string',
          FilterExpression='string',
          SortExpression='string',
          PaginationConfig={
              'MaxItems': 123,
              'PageSize': 123,
              'StartingToken': 'string'
          }
      )
      
    :type FleetId: string
    :param FleetId: 

      A unique identifier for the fleet to search for active game sessions. You can use either the fleet ID or ARN value. Each request must reference either a fleet ID or alias ID, but not both.

      

    
    :type AliasId: string
    :param AliasId: 

      A unique identifier for the alias associated with the fleet to search for active game sessions. You can use either the alias ID or ARN value. Each request must reference either a fleet ID or alias ID, but not both.

      

    
    :type Location: string
    :param Location: 

      A fleet location to search for game sessions. You can specify a fleet's home Region or a remote location. Use the Amazon Web Services Region code format, such as ``us-west-2``.

      

    
    :type FilterExpression: string
    :param FilterExpression: 

      String containing the search criteria for the session search. If no filter expression is included, the request returns results for all game sessions in the fleet that are in ``ACTIVE`` status.

       

      A filter expression can contain one or multiple conditions. Each condition consists of the following:

       

      
      * **Operand** -- Name of a game session attribute. Valid values are ``gameSessionName``, ``gameSessionId``, ``gameSessionProperties``, ``maximumSessions``, ``creationTimeMillis``, ``playerSessionCount``, ``hasAvailablePlayerSessions``.
       
      * **Comparator** -- Valid comparators are: ``=``, ``<>``, ``<``, ``>``, ``<=``, ``>=``.
       
      * **Value** -- Value to be searched for. Values may be numbers, boolean values (true/false) or strings depending on the operand. String values are case sensitive and must be enclosed in single quotes. Special characters must be escaped. Boolean and string values can only be used with the comparators ``=`` and ``<>``. For example, the following filter expression searches on ``gameSessionName``: " ``FilterExpression": "gameSessionName = 'Matt\\'s Awesome Game 1'"``.
      

       

      To chain multiple conditions in a single expression, use the logical keywords ``AND``, ``OR``, and ``NOT`` and parentheses as needed. For example: ``x AND y AND NOT z``, ``NOT (x OR y)``.

       

      Session search evaluates conditions from left to right using the following precedence rules:

       

       
      * ``=``, ``<>``, ``<``, ``>``, ``<=``, ``>=``
       
      * Parentheses
       
      * NOT
       
      * AND
       
      * OR
       

       

      For example, this filter expression retrieves game sessions hosting at least ten players that have an open player slot: ``"maximumSessions>=10 AND hasAvailablePlayerSessions=true"``.

      

    
    :type SortExpression: string
    :param SortExpression: 

      Instructions on how to sort the search results. If no sort expression is included, the request returns results in random order. A sort expression consists of the following elements:

       

      
      * **Operand** -- Name of a game session attribute. Valid values are ``gameSessionName``, ``gameSessionId``, ``gameSessionProperties``, ``maximumSessions``, ``creationTimeMillis``, ``playerSessionCount``, ``hasAvailablePlayerSessions``.
       
      * **Order** -- Valid sort orders are ``ASC`` (ascending) and ``DESC`` (descending).
      

       

      For example, this sort expression returns the oldest active sessions first: ``"SortExpression": "creationTimeMillis ASC"``. Results with a null value for the sort operand are returned at the end of the list.

      

    
    :type PaginationConfig: dict
    :param PaginationConfig: 

      A dictionary that provides parameters to control pagination.

      

    
      - **MaxItems** *(integer) --* 

        The total number of items to return. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified in max-items then a ``NextToken`` will be provided in the output that you can use to resume pagination.

        

      
      - **PageSize** *(integer) --* 

        The size of each page.

        

      
      - **StartingToken** *(string) --* 

        A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previous response.

              .. note::

                

                Avoid using periods (".") in property keys if you plan to search for game sessions by properties. Property keys containing periods cannot be searched and will be filtered out from search results due to search index limitations.

                

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                This key-value pair can store custom data about a game session. For example, you might use a ``GameProperty`` to track a game session's map, level of difficulty, or remaining time. The difficulty level could be specified like this: ``{"Key": "difficulty", "Value":"Novice"}``.

                 

                You can set game properties when creating a game session. You can also modify game properties of an active game session. When searching for game sessions, you can filter on game property keys and values. You can't delete game properties from a game session.

                 

                For examples of working with game properties, see `Create a game session with properties <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-client-api.html#game-properties>`__.

                
                

                - **Key** *(string) --* 

                  The game property identifier.

                   

                  .. note::

                    

                    Avoid using periods (".") in property keys if you plan to search for game sessions by properties. Property keys containing periods cannot be searched and will be filtered out from search results due to search index limitations.

                    

                  
                

                - **Value** *(string) --*

            - **IpAddress** *(string) --* 

              The IP address of the game session. To connect to a Amazon GameLift Servers game server, an app needs both the IP address and port number.

              
            

            - **DnsName** *(string) --* 

              The DNS identifier assigned to the instance that is running the game session. Values have the following format:

               

              
              * TLS-enabled fleets: ``<unique identifier>.<region identifier>.amazongamelift.com``.
               
              * Non-TLS-enabled fleets: ``ec2-<unique identifier>.compute.amazonaws.com``. (See `Amazon EC2 Instance IP Addressing <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-instance-addressing.html#concepts-public-addresses>`__.)
              

               

              When connecting to a game session that is running on a TLS-enabled fleet, you must use the DNS name, not the IP address.

              
            

            - **Port** *(integer) --* 

              The port number for the game session. To connect to a Amazon GameLift Servers game server, an app needs both the IP address and port number.

              
            

            - **PlayerSessionCreationPolicy** *(string) --* 

              Indicates whether the game session is accepting new players.

              
            

            - **CreatorId** *(string) --* 

              A unique identifier for a player. This ID is used to enforce a resource protection policy (if one exists), that limits the number of game sessions a player can create.

              
            

            - **GameSessionData** *(string) --* 

              A set of custom game session properties, formatted as a single string value. This data is passed to a game server process with a request to start a new game session. For more information, see `Start a game session <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-server-api.html#gamelift-sdk-server-startsession>`__.

              
            

            - **MatchmakerData** *(string) --* 

              Information about the matchmaking process that resulted in the game session, if matchmaking was used. Data is in JSON syntax, formatted as a string. Information includes the matchmaker ID as well as player attributes and team assignments. For more details on matchmaker data, see `Match Data <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/flexmatchguide/match-server.html#match-server-data>`__. Matchmaker data is updated whenever new players are added during a successful backfill (see `StartMatchBackfill <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_StartMatchBackfill.html>`__).

              
            

            - **Location** *(string) --* 

              The fleet location where the game session is running. This value might specify the fleet's home Region or a remote location. Location is expressed as an Amazon Web Services Region code such as ``us-west-2``.
