      response_iterator = paginator.paginate(
          FleetIds=[
              'string',
          ],
          PaginationConfig={
              'MaxItems': 123,

              'StartingToken': 'string'
          }
      )
      
    :type FleetIds: list
    :param FleetIds: 

      A unique identifier for the fleet to retrieve utilization data for. You can use either the fleet ID or ARN value. To retrieve attributes for all current fleets, do not include this parameter.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type PaginationConfig: dict
    :param PaginationConfig: 

      A dictionary that provides parameters to control pagination.

      

    
      - **MaxItems** *(integer) --* 

        The total number of items to return. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified in max-items then a ``NextToken`` will be provided in the output that you can use to resume pagination.

        

      
      - **PageSize** *(integer) --* 

        The size of each page.

        

      
      - **StartingToken** *(string) --* 

        A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previous response.

          - *(dict) --* 

            Current resource utilization statistics in a specified fleet or location. The location value might refer to a fleet's remote location or its home region.
