            - **GameSessionCreationLimitPolicy** *(dict) --* 

              A policy that limits the number of game sessions that each individual player can create on instances in this fleet. The limit applies for a specified span of time.

              
              

              - **NewGameSessionsPerCreator** *(integer) --*

                The policy evaluates when a player tries to create a new game session. On receiving a ``CreateGameSession`` request, Amazon GameLift Servers checks that the player (identified by ``CreatorId``) has created fewer than game session limit in the specified time period.

                
              

              - **PolicyPeriodInMinutes** *(integer) --*
