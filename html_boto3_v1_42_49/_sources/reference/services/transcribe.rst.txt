.. py:class:: TranscribeService.Client

  A low-level client representing Amazon Transcribe Service
  

  Amazon Transcribe offers three main types of batch transcription: **Standard**, **Medical**, and **Call Analytics**.

   

  
  * **Standard transcriptions** are the most common option. Refer to for details.
   
  * **Medical transcriptions** are tailored to medical professionals and incorporate medical terms. A common use case for this service is transcribing doctor-patient dialogue into after-visit notes. Refer to for details.
   
  * **Call Analytics transcriptions** are designed for use with call center audio on two different channels; if you're looking for insight into customer service calls, use this option. Refer to for details.
