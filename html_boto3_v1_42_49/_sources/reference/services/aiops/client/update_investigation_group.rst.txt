        ]
    )
    
  :type identifier: string
  :param identifier: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specify either the name or the ARN of the investigation group that you want to modify.

    

  
  :type roleArn: string
  :param roleArn: 

    Specify this field if you want to change the IAM role that CloudWatch investigations will use when it gathers investigation data. To do so, specify the ARN of the new role.

     

    The permissions in this role determine which of your resources that CloudWatch investigations will have access to during investigations.

     

    For more information, see `How to control what data CloudWatch investigations has access to during investigations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Investigations-Security.html#Investigations-Security-Data>`__.

    

  
  :type encryptionConfiguration: dict
  :param encryptionConfiguration: 

    Use this structure if you want to use a customer managed KMS key to encrypt your investigation data. If you omit this parameter, CloudWatch investigations will use an Amazon Web Services key to encrypt the data. For more information, see `Encryption of investigation data <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Investigations-Security.html#Investigations-KMS>`__.

    

  
    - **type** *(string) --* 

      Displays whether investigation data is encrypted by a customer managed key or an Amazon Web Services owned key.

      

    
    - **kmsKeyId** *(string) --* 

      If the investigation group uses a customer managed key for encryption, this field displays the ID of that key.

      

    
  
  :type tagKeyBoundaries: list
  :param tagKeyBoundaries: 

    Enter the existing custom tag keys for custom applications in your system. Resource tags help CloudWatch investigations narrow the search space when it is unable to discover definite relationships between resources. For example, to discover that an Amazon ECS service depends on an Amazon RDS database, CloudWatch investigations can discover this relationship using data sources such as X-Ray and CloudWatch Application Signals. However, if you haven't deployed these features, CloudWatch investigations will attempt to identify possible relationships. Tag boundaries can be used to narrow the resources that will be discovered by CloudWatch investigations in these cases.

     

    You don't need to enter tags created by myApplications or CloudFormation, because CloudWatch investigations can automatically detect those tags.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type chatbotNotificationChannel: dict
  :param chatbotNotificationChannel: 

    Use this structure to integrate CloudWatch investigations with chat applications. This structure is a string array. For the first string, specify the ARN of an Amazon SNS topic. For the array of strings, specify the ARNs of one or more chat applications configurations that you want to associate with that topic. For more information about these configuration ARNs, see `Getting started with Amazon Q in chat applications <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chatbot/latest/adminguide/getting-started.html>`__ and `Resource type defined by Amazon Web Services Chatbot <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_awschatbot.html#awschatbot-resources-for-iam-policies>`__.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    
      - *(list) --* 

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
    


  :type isCloudTrailEventHistoryEnabled: boolean
  :param isCloudTrailEventHistoryEnabled: 

    Specify ``true`` to enable CloudWatch investigations to have access to change events that are recorded by CloudTrail. The default is ``true``.

    

  
  :type crossAccountConfigurations: list
  :param crossAccountConfigurations: 

    Used to configure cross-account access for an investigation group. It allows the investigation group to access resources in other accounts.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      This structure contains information about the cross-account configuration in the account.

      

    
      - **sourceRoleArn** *(string) --* 

        The ARN of an existing role which will be used to do investigations on your behalf.
