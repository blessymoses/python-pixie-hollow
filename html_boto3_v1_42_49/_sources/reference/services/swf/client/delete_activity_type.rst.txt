.. py:method:: SWF.Client.delete_activity_type(**kwargs)

  

  Deletes the specified *activity type*.

   

  Note: Prior to deletion, activity types must first be **deprecated**.

   

  After an activity type has been deleted, you cannot schedule new activities of that type. Activities that started before the type was deleted will continue to run.

   

  **Access Control**

   

  You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF resources as follows:

   

  
  * Use a ``Resource`` element with the domain name to limit the action to only specified domains.
   
  * Use an ``Action`` element to allow or deny permission to call this action.
   
  * Constrain the following parameters by using a ``Condition`` element with the appropriate keys. 

    
    * ``activityType.name``: String constraint. The key is ``swf:activityType.name``.
     
    * ``activityType.version``: String constraint. The key is ``swf:activityType.version``.
    

  
  

   

  If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the action fails. The associated event attribute's ``cause`` parameter is set to ``OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED``. For details and example IAM policies, see `Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/swf-dev-iam.html>`__ in the *Amazon SWF Developer Guide*.
