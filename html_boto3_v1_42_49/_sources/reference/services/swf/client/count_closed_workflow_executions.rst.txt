.. py:method:: SWF.Client.count_closed_workflow_executions(**kwargs)

  

  Returns the number of closed workflow executions within the given domain that meet the specified filtering criteria.

   

  .. note::

    

    This operation is eventually consistent. The results are best effort and may not exactly reflect recent updates and changes.

    

   

  **Access Control**

   

  You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF resources as follows:

   

  
  * Use a ``Resource`` element with the domain name to limit the action to only specified domains.
   
  * Use an ``Action`` element to allow or deny permission to call this action.
   
  * Constrain the following parameters by using a ``Condition`` element with the appropriate keys. 

    
    * ``tagFilter.tag``: String constraint. The key is ``swf:tagFilter.tag``.
     
    * ``typeFilter.name``: String constraint. The key is ``swf:typeFilter.name``.
     
    * ``typeFilter.version``: String constraint. The key is ``swf:typeFilter.version``.
    

  
  

   

  If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the action fails. The associated event attribute's ``cause`` parameter is set to ``OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED``. For details and example IAM policies, see `Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/swf-dev-iam.html>`__ in the *Amazon SWF Developer Guide*.

    If specified, only workflow executions that meet the start time criteria of the filter are counted.

     

    .. note::

      

      ``startTimeFilter`` and ``closeTimeFilter`` are mutually exclusive. You must specify one of these in a request but not both.

      

    

  
    - **oldestDate** *(datetime) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      Specifies the oldest start or close date and time to return.

  :type executionFilter: dict
  :param executionFilter: 

    If specified, only workflow executions matching the ``WorkflowId`` in the filter are counted.

     

    .. note::

      

      ``closeStatusFilter``, ``executionFilter``, ``typeFilter`` and ``tagFilter`` are mutually exclusive. You can specify at most one of these in a request.

      Tags may only contain unicode letters, digits, whitespace, or these symbols: ``_ . : / = + - @``.

      

    
  
  :type closeStatusFilter: dict
  :param closeStatusFilter: 

    If specified, only workflow executions that match this close status are counted. This filter has an affect only if ``executionStatus`` is specified as ``CLOSED``.
