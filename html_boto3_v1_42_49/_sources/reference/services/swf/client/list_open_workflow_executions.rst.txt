.. py:method:: SWF.Client.list_open_workflow_executions(**kwargs)

  

  Returns a list of open workflow executions in the specified domain that meet the filtering criteria. The results may be split into multiple pages. To retrieve subsequent pages, make the call again using the nextPageToken returned by the initial call.

   

  .. note::

    

    This operation is eventually consistent. The results are best effort and may not exactly reflect recent updates and changes.

    

   

  **Access Control**

   

  You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF resources as follows:

   

  
  * Use a ``Resource`` element with the domain name to limit the action to only specified domains.
   
  * Use an ``Action`` element to allow or deny permission to call this action.
   
  * Constrain the following parameters by using a ``Condition`` element with the appropriate keys. 

    
    * ``tagFilter.tag``: String constraint. The key is ``swf:tagFilter.tag``.
     
    * ``typeFilter.name``: String constraint. The key is ``swf:typeFilter.name``.
     
    * ``typeFilter.version``: String constraint. The key is ``swf:typeFilter.version``.
    

  
  

   

  If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the action fails. The associated event attribute's ``cause`` parameter is set to ``OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED``. For details and example IAM policies, see `Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/swf-dev-iam.html>`__ in the *Amazon SWF Developer Guide*.

        reverseOrder=True|False,
        executionFilter={
            'workflowId': 'string'
        }
    )
    
  :type domain: string
  :param domain: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of the domain that contains the workflow executions to list.

    

  
  :type startTimeFilter: dict
  :param startTimeFilter: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Workflow executions are included in the returned results based on whether their start times are within the range specified by this filter.

    

  
    - **oldestDate** *(datetime) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      Specifies the oldest start or close date and time to return.

      

    
    - **latestDate** *(datetime) --* 

      Specifies the latest start or close date and time to return.

      

    
  
  :type typeFilter: dict
  :param typeFilter: 

    If specified, only executions of the type specified in the filter are returned.

     

    .. note::

      

      ``executionFilter``, ``typeFilter`` and ``tagFilter`` are mutually exclusive. You can specify at most one of these in a request.

      

    

  
    - **name** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      Name of the workflow type.

      

    
    - **version** *(string) --* 

      Version of the workflow type.

      

    
  
  :type tagFilter: dict
  :param tagFilter: 

    If specified, only executions that have the matching tag are listed.

     

    .. note::

      

      ``executionFilter``, ``typeFilter`` and ``tagFilter`` are mutually exclusive. You can specify at most one of these in a request.

      

    

  
    - **tag** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      Specifies the tag that must be associated with the execution for it to meet the filter criteria.

       

      Tags may only contain unicode letters, digits, whitespace, or these symbols: ``_ . : / = + - @``.

      

    
  
  :type nextPageToken: string
  :param nextPageToken: 

    If ``NextPageToken`` is returned there are more results available. The value of ``NextPageToken`` is a unique pagination token for each page. Make the call again using the returned token to retrieve the next page. Keep all other arguments unchanged. Each pagination token expires after 24 hours. Using an expired pagination token will return a ``400`` error: " ``Specified token has exceeded its maximum lifetime``".

     

    The configured ``maximumPageSize`` determines how many results can be returned in a single call.

    

  
  :type maximumPageSize: integer
  :param maximumPageSize: 

    The maximum number of results that are returned per call. Use ``nextPageToken`` to obtain further pages of results.

    

  
  :type reverseOrder: boolean
  :param reverseOrder: 

    When set to ``true``, returns the results in reverse order. By default the results are returned in descending order of the start time of the executions.

    

  
  :type executionFilter: dict
  :param executionFilter: 

    If specified, only workflow executions matching the workflow ID specified in the filter are returned.

     

    .. note::

      

      ``executionFilter``, ``typeFilter`` and ``tagFilter`` are mutually exclusive. You can specify at most one of these in a request.

      

    

  
    - **workflowId** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The workflowId to pass of match the criteria of this filter.

          - **startTimestamp** *(datetime) --*

            If the execution status is closed then this specifies how the execution was closed:

             

            
            * ``COMPLETED`` – the execution was successfully completed.
             
            * ``CANCELED`` – the execution was canceled.Cancellation allows the implementation to gracefully clean up before the execution is closed.
             
            * ``TERMINATED`` – the execution was force terminated.
             
            * ``FAILED`` – the execution failed to complete.
             
            * ``TIMED_OUT`` – the execution did not complete in the alloted time and was automatically timed out.
             
            * ``CONTINUED_AS_NEW`` – the execution is logically continued. This means the current execution was completed and a new execution was started to carry on the workflow.
            

            
          

          - **parent** *(dict) --* 

            If this workflow execution is a child of another execution then contains the workflow execution that started this execution.
