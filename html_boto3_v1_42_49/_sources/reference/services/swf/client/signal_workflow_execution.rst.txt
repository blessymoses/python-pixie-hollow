.. py:method:: SWF.Client.signal_workflow_execution(**kwargs)

  

  Records a ``WorkflowExecutionSignaled`` event in the workflow execution history and creates a decision task for the workflow execution identified by the given domain, workflowId and runId. The event is recorded with the specified user defined signalName and input (if provided).

   

  .. note::

    

    If a runId isn't specified, then the ``WorkflowExecutionSignaled`` event is recorded in the history of the current open workflow with the matching workflowId in the domain.

    

   

  .. note::

    

    If the specified workflow execution isn't open, this method fails with ``UnknownResource``.

    

   

  **Access Control**

   

  You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF resources as follows:

   

  
  * Use a ``Resource`` element with the domain name to limit the action to only specified domains.
   
  * Use an ``Action`` element to allow or deny permission to call this action.
   
  * You cannot use an IAM policy to constrain this action's parameters.
  

   

  If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the action fails. The associated event attribute's ``cause`` parameter is set to ``OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED``. For details and example IAM policies, see `Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/swf-dev-iam.html>`__ in the *Amazon SWF Developer Guide*.
