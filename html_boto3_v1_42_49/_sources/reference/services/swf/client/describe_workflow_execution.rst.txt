***************************



.. py:method:: SWF.Client.describe_workflow_execution(**kwargs)

  

  Returns information about the specified workflow execution including its type and some statistics.

   

  .. note::

    

    This operation is eventually consistent. The results are best effort and may not exactly reflect recent updates and changes.

    

   

  **Access Control**

   

  You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF resources as follows:

   

  
  * Use a ``Resource`` element with the domain name to limit the action to only specified domains.
   
  * Use an ``Action`` element to allow or deny permission to call this action.
   
  * You cannot use an IAM policy to constrain this action's parameters.
  

   

  If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the action fails. The associated event attribute's ``cause`` parameter is set to ``OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED``. For details and example IAM policies, see `Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/swf-dev-iam.html>`__ in the *Amazon SWF Developer Guide*.

        - **startTimestamp** *(datetime) --* 

          The time when the execution was started.

          
        

        - **closeTimestamp** *(datetime) --* 

          The time when the workflow execution was closed. Set only if the execution status is CLOSED.

        - **closeStatus** *(string) --* 

          If the execution status is closed then this specifies how the execution was closed:

           

          
          * ``COMPLETED`` – the execution was successfully completed.
           
          * ``CANCELED`` – the execution was canceled.Cancellation allows the implementation to gracefully clean up before the execution is closed.
           
          * ``TERMINATED`` – the execution was force terminated.
           
          * ``FAILED`` – the execution failed to complete.
           
          * ``TIMED_OUT`` – the execution did not complete in the alloted time and was automatically timed out.
           
          * ``CONTINUED_AS_NEW`` – the execution is logically continued. This means the current execution was completed and a new execution was started to carry on the workflow.

        - **taskPriority** *(string) --* 

          The priority assigned to decision tasks for this workflow execution. Valid values are integers that range from Java's ``Integer.MIN_VALUE`` (-2147483648) to ``Integer.MAX_VALUE`` (2147483647). Higher numbers indicate higher priority.

           

          For more information about setting task priority, see `Setting Task Priority <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/programming-priority.html>`__ in the *Amazon SWF Developer Guide*.

          The supported child policies are:

           

          
          * ``TERMINATE`` – The child executions are terminated.
           
          * ``REQUEST_CANCEL`` – A request to cancel is attempted for each child execution by recording a ``WorkflowExecutionCancelRequested`` event in its history. It is up to the decider to take appropriate actions when it receives an execution history with this event.
           
          * ``ABANDON`` – No action is taken. The child executions continue to run.
