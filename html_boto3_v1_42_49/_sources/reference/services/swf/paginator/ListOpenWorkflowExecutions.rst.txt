                  The combination of workflow type name and version must be unique with in a domain.

                  

                
          
            

            - **startTimestamp** *(datetime) --*

              * ``CANCELED`` – the execution was canceled.Cancellation allows the implementation to gracefully clean up before the execution is closed.
               
              * ``TERMINATED`` – the execution was force terminated.

            - **tagList** *(list) --* 

              The list of tags associated with the workflow execution. Tags can be used to identify and list workflow executions of interest through the visibility APIs. A workflow execution can have a maximum of 5 tags.

              
              

              - *(string) --*
