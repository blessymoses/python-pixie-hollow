  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_services(
        NextToken='string',
        MaxResults=123
    )
    
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    Specifies a value for receiving additional results after you receive a ``NextToken`` response in a previous request. A ``NextToken`` response indicates that more output is available. Set this parameter to the value of the previous call's ``NextToken`` response to indicate where the output should continue from.

    

  
  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    Specifies the maximum number of results that you want included on each page of the response. If you do not include this parameter, it defaults to a value appropriate to the operation. If additional items exist beyond those included in the current response, the ``NextToken`` response element is present and has a value (is not null). Include that value as the ``NextToken`` request parameter in the next call to the operation to get the next part of the results.

     

    .. note::

      

      An API operation can return fewer results than the maximum even when there are more results available. You should check ``NextToken`` after every operation to ensure that you receive all of the results.

    **Response Syntax**

    
    ::

      {
          'NextToken': 'string',
          'Services': [
              {
                  'ServiceCode': 'string',
                  'ServiceName': 'string'
              },
          ]
      }
      
    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

        If present, indicates that more output is available than is included in the current response. Use this value in the ``NextToken`` request parameter in a subsequent call to the operation to get the next part of the output. You should repeat this until the ``NextToken`` response element comes back as ``null``.

        
      

      - **Services** *(list) --* 

        The list of the Amazon Web Services service names and service codes.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          Information about an Amazon Web Services service.

          
          

          - **ServiceCode** *(string) --* 

            Specifies the service identifier. To find the service code value for an Amazon Web Services service, use the  ListServices operation.

            
          

          - **ServiceName** *(string) --* 

            Specifies the service name.
