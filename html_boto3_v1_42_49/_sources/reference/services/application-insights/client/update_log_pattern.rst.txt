  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.update_log_pattern(
        ResourceGroupName='string',
        PatternSetName='string',
        PatternName='string',
        Pattern='string',
        Rank=123
    )
    
  :type ResourceGroupName: string
  :param ResourceGroupName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of the resource group.

    

  
  :type PatternSetName: string
  :param PatternSetName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of the log pattern set.

    

  
  :type PatternName: string
  :param PatternName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of the log pattern.

    

  
  :type Pattern: string
  :param Pattern: 

    The log pattern. The pattern must be DFA compatible. Patterns that utilize forward lookahead or backreference constructions are not supported.

    

  
  :type Rank: integer
  :param Rank: 

    Rank of the log pattern. Must be a value between ``1`` and ``1,000,000``. The patterns are sorted by rank, so we recommend that you set your highest priority patterns with the lowest rank. A pattern of rank ``1`` will be the first to get matched to a log line. A pattern of rank ``1,000,000`` will be last to get matched. When you configure custom log patterns from the console, a ``Low`` severity pattern translates to a ``750,000`` rank. A ``Medium`` severity pattern translates to a ``500,000`` rank. And a ``High`` severity pattern translates to a ``250,000`` rank. Rank values less than ``1`` or greater than ``1,000,000`` are reserved for Amazon Web Services provided patterns.

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **ResourceGroupName** *(string) --* 

        The name of the resource group.

        
      

      - **LogPattern** *(dict) --* 

        The successfully created log pattern.

        
        

        - **PatternSetName** *(string) --* 

          The name of the log pattern. A log pattern name can contain as many as 30 characters, and it cannot be empty. The characters can be Unicode letters, digits, or one of the following symbols: period, dash, underscore.

          
        

        - **PatternName** *(string) --* 

          The name of the log pattern. A log pattern name can contain as many as 50 characters, and it cannot be empty. The characters can be Unicode letters, digits, or one of the following symbols: period, dash, underscore.

          
        

        - **Pattern** *(string) --* 

          A regular expression that defines the log pattern. A log pattern can contain as many as 50 characters, and it cannot be empty. The pattern must be DFA compatible. Patterns that utilize forward lookahead or backreference constructions are not supported.
