.. py:method:: ApplicationInsights.Client.list_tags_for_resource(**kwargs)

  

  Retrieve a list of the tags (keys and values) that are associated with a specified application. A *tag* is a label that you optionally define and associate with an application. Each tag consists of a required *tag key* and an optional associated *tag value*. A tag key is a general label that acts as a category for more specific tag values. A tag value acts as a descriptor within a tag key.

    ::

      {
          'Tags': [
              {
                  'Key': 'string',

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **Tags** *(list) --* 

        An array that lists all the tags that are associated with the application. Each tag consists of a required tag key ( ``Key``) and an associated tag value ( ``Value``).

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          An object that defines the tags associated with an application. A *tag* is a label that you optionally define and associate with an application. Tags can help you categorize and manage resources in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria.

           

          Each tag consists of a required *tag key* and an associated *tag value*, both of which you define. A tag key is a general label that acts as a category for a more specific tag value. A tag value acts as a descriptor within a tag key. A tag key can contain as many as 128 characters. A tag value can contain as many as 256 characters. The characters can be Unicode letters, digits, white space, or one of the following symbols: _ . : / = + -. The following additional restrictions apply to tags:

           

          
          * Tag keys and values are case sensitive.
           
          * For each associated resource, each tag key must be unique and it can have only one value.
           
          * The ``aws:`` prefix is reserved for use by Amazon Web Services; you can’t use it in any tag keys or values that you define. In addition, you can't edit or remove tag keys or values that use this prefix.
          

          
          

          - **Key** *(string) --* 

            One part of a key-value pair that defines a tag. The maximum length of a tag key is 128 characters. The minimum length is 1 character.

            
          

          - **Value** *(string) --* 

            The optional part of a key-value pair that defines a tag. The maximum length of a tag value is 256 characters. The minimum length is 0 characters. If you don't want an application to have a specific tag value, don't specify a value for this parameter.

  *   :py:class:`ApplicationInsights.Client.exceptions.ResourceNotFoundException`
