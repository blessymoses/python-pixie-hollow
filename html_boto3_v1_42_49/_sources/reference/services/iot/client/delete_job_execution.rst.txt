  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.delete_job_execution(
        jobId='string',
        thingName='string',
        executionNumber=123,
        force=True|False,
        namespaceId='string'
    )
    
  :type jobId: string
  :param jobId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ID of the job whose execution on a particular device will be deleted.

    

  
  :type thingName: string
  :param thingName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of the thing whose job execution will be deleted.

    

  
  :type executionNumber: integer
  :param executionNumber: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ID of the job execution to be deleted. The ``executionNumber`` refers to the execution of a particular job on a particular device.

     

    Note that once a job execution is deleted, the ``executionNumber`` may be reused by IoT, so be sure you get and use the correct value here.

    

  
  :type force: boolean
  :param force: 

    (Optional) When true, you can delete a job execution which is "IN_PROGRESS". Otherwise, you can only delete a job execution which is in a terminal state ("SUCCEEDED", "FAILED", "REJECTED", "REMOVED" or "CANCELED") or an exception will occur. The default is false.

     

    .. note::

      

      Deleting a job execution which is "IN_PROGRESS", will cause the device to be unable to access job information or update the job execution status. Use caution and ensure that the device is able to recover to a valid state.

      

    

  
  :type namespaceId: string
  :param namespaceId: 

    The namespace used to indicate that a job is a customer-managed job.

     

    When you specify a value for this parameter, Amazon Web Services IoT Core sends jobs notifications to MQTT topics that contain the value in the following format.

     

    ``$aws/things/THING_NAME/jobs/JOB_ID/notify-namespace-NAMESPACE_ID/``

     

    .. note::

      

      The ``namespaceId`` feature is only supported by IoT Greengrass at this time. For more information, see `Setting up IoT Greengrass core devices. <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/setting-up.html>`__
