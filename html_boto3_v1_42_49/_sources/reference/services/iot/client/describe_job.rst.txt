    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **documentSource** *(string) --* 

        An S3 link to the job document.

        
      

      - **job** *(dict) --* 

        Information about the job.

        
        

        - **jobArn** *(string) --* 

          An ARN identifying the job with format "arn:aws:iot:region:account:job/jobId".

          
        

        - **jobId** *(string) --* 

          The unique identifier you assigned to this job when it was created.

          
        

        - **targetSelection** *(string) --* 

          Specifies whether the job will continue to run (CONTINUOUS), or will be complete after all those things specified as targets have completed the job (SNAPSHOT). If continuous, the job may also be run on a thing when a change is detected in a target. For example, a job will run on a device when the thing representing the device is added to a target group, even after the job was completed by all things originally in the group.

           

          .. note::

            

            We recommend that you use continuous jobs instead of snapshot jobs for dynamic thing group targets. By using continuous jobs, devices that join the group receive the job execution even after the job has been created.

          If the job was updated, provides the reason code for the update.

          
        

        - **comment** *(string) --* 

          If the job was updated, describes the reason for the update.

          
        

        - **targets** *(list) --* 

          A list of IoT things and thing groups to which the job should be sent.

          
          

          - *(string) --*

            The time a job will begin rollout of the job document to all devices in the target group for a job. The ``startTime`` can be scheduled up to a year in advance and must be scheduled a minimum of thirty minutes from the current time. The date and time format for the ``startTime`` is YYYY-MM-DD for the date and HH:MM for the time.
