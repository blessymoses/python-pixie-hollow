  :type jobId: string
  :param jobId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A job identifier which must be unique for your account. We recommend using a UUID. Alpha-numeric characters, "-" and "_" are valid for use here.

    

  
  :type targets: list
  :param targets: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A list of things and thing groups to which the job should be sent.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type documentSource: string
  :param documentSource: 

    An S3 link, or S3 object URL, to the job document. The link is an Amazon S3 object URL and is required if you don't specify a value for ``document``.

     

    For example, ``--document-source https://s3.region-code.amazonaws.com/example-firmware/device-firmware.1.0``

     

    For more information, see `Methods for accessing a bucket <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-bucket-intro.html>`__.

    

  
  :type document: string
  :param document: 

    The job document. Required if you don't specify a value for ``documentSource``.

    

  
  :type description: string
  :param description: 

    A short text description of the job.

    

  
  :type presignedUrlConfig: dict
  :param presignedUrlConfig: 

    Configuration information for pre-signed S3 URLs.

    

  
    - **roleArn** *(string) --* 

      The ARN of an IAM role that grants permission to download files from the S3 bucket where the job data/updates are stored. The role must also grant permission for IoT to download the files.

       

      .. warning::

         

        For information about addressing the confused deputy problem, see `cross-service confused deputy prevention <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/cross-service-confused-deputy-prevention.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services IoT Core developer guide*.

        

      

    
    - **expiresInSec** *(integer) --* 

      How long (in seconds) pre-signed URLs are valid. Valid values are 60 - 3600, the default value is 3600 seconds. Pre-signed URLs are generated when Jobs receives an MQTT request for the job document.

      

    
  
  :type targetSelection: string
  :param targetSelection: 

    Specifies whether the job will continue to run (CONTINUOUS), or will be complete after all those things specified as targets have completed the job (SNAPSHOT). If continuous, the job may also be run on a thing when a change is detected in a target. For example, a job will run on a thing when the thing is added to a target group, even after the job was completed by all things originally in the group.

     

    .. note::

      

      We recommend that you use continuous jobs instead of snapshot jobs for dynamic thing group targets. By using continuous jobs, devices that join the group receive the job execution even after the job has been created.

      

    

  
  :type jobExecutionsRolloutConfig: dict

    Allows you to create a staged rollout of the job.

        - **failureType** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The type of job execution failures that can initiate a job abort.

          The type of job action to take to initiate the job abort.

          

        
        - **thresholdPercentage** *(float) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The minimum percentage of job execution failures that must occur to initiate the job abort.

           

          Amazon Web Services IoT Core supports up to two digits after the decimal (for example, 10.9 and 10.99, but not 10.999).

  :type timeoutConfig: dict
  :param timeoutConfig: 

    Specifies the amount of time each device has to finish its execution of the job. The timer is started when the job execution status is set to ``IN_PROGRESS``. If the job execution status is not set to another terminal state before the time expires, it will be automatically set to ``TIMED_OUT``.

    

  
    - **inProgressTimeoutInMinutes** *(integer) --* 

      Specifies the amount of time, in minutes, this device has to finish execution of this job. The timeout interval can be anywhere between 1 minute and 7 days (1 to 10080 minutes). The in progress timer can't be updated and will apply to all job executions for the job. Whenever a job execution remains in the IN_PROGRESS status for longer than this interval, the job execution will fail and switch to the terminal ``TIMED_OUT`` status.

      

    
  
  :type tags: list
  :param tags: 

    Metadata which can be used to manage the job.

    ``$aws/things/THING_NAME/jobs/JOB_ID/notify-namespace-NAMESPACE_ID/``

     

    .. note::

      

      The ``namespaceId`` feature is only supported by IoT Greengrass at this time. For more information, see `Setting up IoT Greengrass core devices. <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/setting-up.html>`__
