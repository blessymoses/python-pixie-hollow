    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **EngagementMemberList** *(list) --* 

        Provides a list of engagement members.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          Engagement members are the participants in an Engagement, which is likely a collaborative project or business opportunity within the AWS partner network. Members can be different partner organizations or AWS accounts that are working together on a specific engagement.

           

          Each member is represented by their AWS Account ID, Company Name, and associated details. Members have a status within the Engagement (PENDING, ACCEPTED, REJECTED, or WITHDRAWN), indicating their current state of participation. Only existing members of an Engagement can view the list of other members. This implies a level of privacy and access control within the Engagement structure.

          
          

          - **CompanyName** *(string) --* 

            The official name of the member's company or organization.

            
          

          - **WebsiteUrl** *(string) --* 

            The URL of the member company's website. This offers a way to find more information about the member organization and serves as an additional identifier.

            
          

          - **AccountId** *(string) --* 

            This is the unique identifier for the AWS account associated with the member organization. It's used for AWS-related operations and identity verification.

            
      
    
      

      - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

        A pagination token used to retrieve the next set of results. If there are more results available than can be returned in a single response, this token will be present. Use this token in a subsequent request to retrieve the next page of results. If there are no more results, this value will be null.
