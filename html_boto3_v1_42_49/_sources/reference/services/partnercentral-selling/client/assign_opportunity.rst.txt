.. py:method:: PartnerCentralSellingAPI.Client.assign_opportunity(**kwargs)

  

  Enables you to reassign an existing ``Opportunity`` to another user within your Partner Central account. The specified user receives the opportunity, and it appears on their Partner Central dashboard, allowing them to take necessary actions or proceed with the opportunity.

   

  This is useful for distributing opportunities to the appropriate team members or departments within your organization, ensuring that each opportunity is handled by the right person. By default, the opportunity owner is the one who creates it. Currently, there's no API to enumerate the list of available users.

    response = client.assign_opportunity(
        Catalog='string',
        Identifier='string',
        Assignee={
            'Email': 'string',

  :type Catalog: string
  :param Catalog: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies the catalog associated with the request. This field takes a string value from a predefined list: ``AWS`` or ``Sandbox``. The catalog determines which environment the opportunity is assigned in. Use ``AWS`` to assign real opportunities in the Amazon Web Services catalog, and ``Sandbox`` for testing in secure, isolated environments.

    

  
  :type Identifier: string
  :param Identifier: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Requires the ``Opportunity``'s unique identifier when you want to assign it to another user. Provide the correct identifier so the intended opportunity is reassigned.

    

  
  :type Assignee: dict
  :param Assignee: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies the user or team member responsible for managing the assigned opportunity. This field identifies the *Assignee* based on the partner's internal team structure. Ensure that the email address is associated with a registered user in your Partner Central account.

    

  
    - **Email** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

    - **FirstName** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      Specifies the first name of the assignee managing the opportunity. The system automatically retrieves this value from the user profile by referencing the associated email address.

      

    
    - **LastName** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      Specifies the last name of the assignee managing the opportunity. The system automatically retrieves this value from the user profile by referencing the associated email address.

      

    
    - **Phone** *(string) --* 

      Specifies the contact phone number of the assignee responsible for the opportunity or engagement. This field enables direct communication for time-sensitive matters and facilitates coordination between AWS and partner teams.

      

    
    - **BusinessTitle** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      Specifies the business title of the assignee managing the opportunity. This helps clarify the individual's role and responsibilities within the organization. Use the value ``PartnerAccountManager`` to update details of the opportunity owner.
