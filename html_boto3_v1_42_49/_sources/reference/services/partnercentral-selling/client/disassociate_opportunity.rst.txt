.. py:method:: PartnerCentralSellingAPI.Client.disassociate_opportunity(**kwargs)

  

  Allows you to remove an existing association between an ``Opportunity`` and related entities, such as a Partner Solution, Amazon Web Services product, or an Amazon Web Services Marketplace offer. This operation is the counterpart to ``AssociateOpportunity``, and it provides flexibility to manage associations as business needs change.

   

  Use this operation to update the associations of an ``Opportunity`` due to changes in the related entities, or if an association was made in error. Ensuring accurate associations helps maintain clarity and accuracy to track and manage business opportunities. When you replace an entity, first attach the new entity and then disassociate the one to be removed, especially if it's the last remaining entity that's required.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.disassociate_opportunity(
        Catalog='string',
        OpportunityIdentifier='string',
        RelatedEntityType='Solutions'|'AwsProducts'|'AwsMarketplaceOffers'|'AwsMarketplaceOfferSets',
        RelatedEntityIdentifier='string'
    )
    
  :type Catalog: string
  :param Catalog: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies the catalog associated with the request. This field takes a string value from a predefined list: ``AWS`` or ``Sandbox``. The catalog determines which environment the opportunity disassociation is made in. Use ``AWS`` to disassociate opportunities in the Amazon Web Services catalog, and ``Sandbox`` for testing in secure, isolated environments.

    

  
  :type OpportunityIdentifier: string
  :param OpportunityIdentifier: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The opportunity's unique identifier for when you want to disassociate it from related entities. This identifier helps to ensure that the correct opportunity is updated.

     

    Validation: Ensure that the provided identifier corresponds to an existing opportunity in the Amazon Web Services system because incorrect identifiers result in an error and no changes are made.

    

  
  :type RelatedEntityType: string
  :param RelatedEntityType: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The type of the entity that you're disassociating from the opportunity. When you specify the entity type, it helps the system correctly process the disassociation request to ensure that the right connections are removed.

     

    Examples of entity types include Partner Solution, Amazon Web Services product, and Amazon Web Services Marketplaceoffer. Ensure that the value matches one of the expected entity types.

     

    Validation: Provide a valid entity type to help ensure successful disassociation. An invalid or incorrect entity type results in an error.

    

  
  :type RelatedEntityIdentifier: string
  :param RelatedEntityIdentifier: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The related entity's identifier that you want to disassociate from the opportunity. Depending on the type of entity, this could be a simple identifier or an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for entities managed through Amazon Web Services Marketplace.

     

    For Amazon Web Services Marketplace entities, use the Amazon Web Services Marketplace API to obtain the necessary ARNs. For guidance on retrieving these ARNs, see `Amazon Web Services MarketplaceUsing the Amazon Web Services Marketplace Catalog API <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace-catalog/latest/api-reference/welcome.html>`__.

     

    Validation: Ensure the identifier or ARN is valid and corresponds to an existing entity. An incorrect or invalid identifier results in an error.
