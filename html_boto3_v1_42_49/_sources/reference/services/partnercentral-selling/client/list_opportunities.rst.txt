.. py:method:: PartnerCentralSellingAPI.Client.list_opportunities(**kwargs)

  

  This request accepts a list of filters that retrieve opportunity subsets as well as sort options. This feature is available to partners from `Partner Central <https://partnercentral.awspartner.com/>`__ using the ``ListOpportunities`` API action.

   

  To synchronize your system with Amazon Web Services, list only the opportunities that were newly created or updated. We recommend you rely on events emitted by the service into your Amazon Web Services account’s Amazon EventBridge default event bus. You can also use the ``ListOpportunities`` action.

   

  We recommend the following approach:

   

   
  * Find the latest ``LastModifiedDate`` that you stored, and only use the values that came from Amazon Web Services. Don’t use values generated by your system.
   
  * When you send a ``ListOpportunities`` request, submit the date in ISO 8601 format in the ``AfterLastModifiedDate`` filter.
   
  * Amazon Web Services only returns opportunities created or updated on or after that date and time. Use ``NextToken`` to iterate over all pages.

    )
    
  :type Catalog: string
  :param Catalog: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies the catalog associated with the request. This field takes a string value from a predefined list: ``AWS`` or ``Sandbox``. The catalog determines which environment the opportunities are listed in. Use ``AWS`` for listing real opportunities in the Amazon Web Services catalog, and ``Sandbox`` for testing in secure, isolated environments.

    

  
  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    Specifies the maximum number of results to return in a single call. This limits the number of opportunities returned in the response to avoid providing too many results at once.

     

    Default: 20

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    A pagination token used to retrieve the next set of results in subsequent calls. This token is included in the response only if there are additional result pages available.

    

  
  :type Sort: dict
  :param Sort: 

    An object that specifies how the response is sorted. The default ``Sort.SortBy`` value is ``LastModifiedDate``.

    

  
    - **SortOrder** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      Sort order.

       

      Default: ``Descending``

    - **BeforeLastModifiedDate** *(datetime) --* 

      Specifies the date before which the opportunities were modified. Use this filter to retrieve only those opportunities that were modified before a given timestamp.

      

    
  
  :type Identifier: list
  :param Identifier: 

    Filters the opportunities based on the opportunity identifier. This allows partners to retrieve specific opportunities by providing their unique identifiers, ensuring precise results.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type LifeCycleStage: list
  :param LifeCycleStage: 

    Filters the opportunities based on their lifecycle stage. This filter allows partners to retrieve opportunities at various stages in the sales cycle, such as ``Qualified``, ``Technical Validation``, ``Business Validation``, or ``Closed Won``.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type LifeCycleReviewStatus: list
  :param LifeCycleReviewStatus: 

    Filters the opportunities based on their current lifecycle approval status. Use this filter to retrieve opportunities with statuses such as ``Pending Submission``, ``In Review``, ``Action Required``, or ``Approved``.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type CustomerCompanyName: list
  :param CustomerCompanyName: 

    Filters the opportunities based on the customer's company name. This allows partners to search for opportunities associated with a specific customer by matching the provided company name string.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type CreatedDate: dict
  :param CreatedDate: 

    Filter opportunities by creation date criteria.

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **OpportunitySummaries** *(list) --* 

        An array that contains minimal details for opportunities that match the request criteria. This summary view provides a quick overview of relevant opportunities.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          An object that contains an ``Opportunity``'s subset of fields.

          
          

          - **Catalog** *(string) --* 

            Specifies the catalog associated with the opportunity, either ``AWS`` or ``Sandbox``. This indicates the environment in which the opportunity is managed.

            
          

          - **Id** *(string) --* 

            Read-only, system-generated ``Opportunity`` unique identifier.

            
          

          - **Arn** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the opportunity. This globally unique identifier can be used for IAM policies and cross-service references.

            
          

          - **PartnerOpportunityIdentifier** *(string) --* 

            Specifies the ``Opportunity``'s unique identifier in the partner's CRM system. This value is essential to track and reconcile because it's included in the outbound payload sent back to the partner. It allows partners to link an opportunity to their CRM.

            
          

          - **OpportunityType** *(string) --* 

            Specifies opportunity type as a renewal, new, or expansion.

            * New Opportunity: Represents a new business opportunity with a potential customer that's not previously engaged with your solutions or services.
             
            * Renewal Opportunity: Represents an opportunity to renew an existing contract or subscription with a current customer, ensuring continuity of service.
             
            * Expansion Opportunity: Represents an opportunity to expand the scope of an existing contract or subscription, either by adding new services or increasing the volume of existing services for a current customer.
            

            
          

          - **LastModifiedDate** *(datetime) --* 

            ``DateTime`` when the ``Opportunity`` was last modified.

            
          

          - **CreatedDate** *(datetime) --* 

            ``DateTime`` when the ``Opportunity`` was last created.

            
          

          - **LifeCycle** *(dict) --* 

            An object that contains the ``Opportunity``'s lifecycle details.

            
            

            - **Stage** *(string) --* 

              Specifies the current stage of the ``Opportunity``'s lifecycle as it maps to Amazon Web Services stages from the current stage in the partner CRM. This field provides a translated value of the stage, and offers insight into the ``Opportunity``'s progression in the sales cycle, according to Amazon Web Services definitions.

               

              .. note::

                

                A lead and a prospect must be further matured to a ``Qualified`` opportunity before submission. Opportunities that were closed/lost before submission aren't suitable for submission.

                

               

              The descriptions of each sales stage are:

               

              
              * Prospect: Amazon Web Services identifies the opportunity. It can be active (Comes directly from the end customer through a lead) or latent (Your account team believes it exists based on research, account plans, sales plays).
               
              * Qualified: Your account team engaged with the customer to discuss viability and understand requirements. The customer agreed that the opportunity is real, of interest, and may solve business/technical needs.
               
              * Technical Validation: All parties understand the implementation plan.
               
              * Business Validation: Pricing was proposed, and all parties agree to the steps to close.
               
              * Committed: The customer signed the contract, but Amazon Web Services hasn't started billing.
               
              * Launched: The workload is complete, and Amazon Web Services has started billing.
               
              * Closed Lost: The opportunity is lost, and there are no steps to move forward.
              

              
            

            - **ClosedLostReason** *(string) --* 

              Specifies the reason code when an opportunity is marked as *Closed Lost*. When you select an appropriate reason code, you communicate the context for closing the ``Opportunity``, and aid in accurate reports and analysis of opportunity outcomes.

              
            

            - **NextSteps** *(string) --* 

              Specifies the upcoming actions or tasks for the ``Opportunity``. This field is utilized to communicate to Amazon Web Services the next actions required for the ``Opportunity``.

              
            

            - **TargetCloseDate** *(string) --* 

              Specifies the date when Amazon Web Services expects to start significant billing, when the project finishes, and when it moves into production. This field informs the Amazon Web Services seller about when the opportunity launches and starts to incur Amazon Web Services usage.

               

              Ensure the ``Target Close Date`` isn't in the past.

              
            

            - **ReviewStatus** *(string) --* 

              Indicates the review status of a partner referred opportunity. This field is read-only and only applicable for partner referrals. Valid values:

               

              
              * Pending Submission: Not submitted for validation (editable).
               
              * Submitted: Submitted for validation and not yet Amazon Web Services reviewed (read-only).
               
              * In Review: Undergoing Amazon Web Services validation (read-only).
               
              * Action Required: Address any issues Amazon Web Services highlights. Use the ``UpdateOpportunity`` API action to update the opportunity, and ensure you make all required changes. Only these fields are editable when the ``Lifecycle.ReviewStatus`` is ``Action Required``: 

                
                * Customer.Account.Address.City
                 
                * Customer.Account.Address.CountryCode
                 
                * Customer.Account.Address.PostalCode
                 
                * Customer.Account.Address.StateOrRegion
                 
                * Customer.Account.Address.StreetAddress
                 
                * Customer.Account.WebsiteUrl
                 
                * LifeCycle.TargetCloseDate
                 
                * Project.ExpectedCustomerSpend.Amount
                 
                * Project.ExpectedCustomerSpend.CurrencyCode
                 
                * Project.CustomerBusinessProblem
                 
                * PartnerOpportunityIdentifier
                

               

              After updates, the opportunity re-enters the validation phase. This process repeats until all issues are resolved, and the opportunity's ``Lifecycle.ReviewStatus`` is set to ``Approved`` or ``Rejected``.

              
               
              * Approved: Validated and converted into the Amazon Web Services seller's pipeline (editable).
