    **Request Syntax**
    ::

      waiter.wait(
          ClusterIdentifier='string',
          MaxRecords=123,
          Marker='string',
          TagKeys=[
              'string',
          ],
          TagValues=[
              'string',
          ],
          WaiterConfig={
              'Delay': 123,
              'MaxAttempts': 123
          }
      )
      
    :type ClusterIdentifier: string
    :param ClusterIdentifier: 

      The unique identifier of a cluster whose properties you are requesting. This parameter is case sensitive.

       

      The default is that all clusters defined for an account are returned.

      

    
    :type MaxRecords: integer
    :param MaxRecords: 

      The maximum number of response records to return in each call. If the number of remaining response records exceeds the specified ``MaxRecords`` value, a value is returned in a ``marker`` field of the response. You can retrieve the next set of records by retrying the command with the returned marker value.

       

      Default: ``100``

       

      Constraints: minimum 20, maximum 100.

      

    
    :type Marker: string
    :param Marker: 

      An optional parameter that specifies the starting point to return a set of response records. When the results of a  DescribeClusters request exceed the value specified in ``MaxRecords``, Amazon Web Services returns a value in the ``Marker`` field of the response. You can retrieve the next set of response records by providing the returned marker value in the ``Marker`` parameter and retrying the request.

       

      Constraints: You can specify either the **ClusterIdentifier** parameter or the **Marker** parameter, but not both.

      

    
    :type TagKeys: list
    :param TagKeys: 

      A tag key or keys for which you want to return all matching clusters that are associated with the specified key or keys. For example, suppose that you have clusters that are tagged with keys called ``owner`` and ``environment``. If you specify both of these tag keys in the request, Amazon Redshift returns a response with the clusters that have either or both of these tag keys associated with them.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type TagValues: list
    :param TagValues: 

      A tag value or values for which you want to return all matching clusters that are associated with the specified tag value or values. For example, suppose that you have clusters that are tagged with values called ``admin`` and ``test``. If you specify both of these tag values in the request, Amazon Redshift returns a response with the clusters that have either or both of these tag values associated with them.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type WaiterConfig: dict
    :param WaiterConfig: 

      A dictionary that provides parameters to control waiting behavior.

      

    
      - **Delay** *(integer) --* 

        The amount of time in seconds to wait between attempts. Default: 60

        

      
      - **MaxAttempts** *(integer) --* 

        The maximum number of attempts to be made. Default: 30

        

      
    
    
    :returns: None
