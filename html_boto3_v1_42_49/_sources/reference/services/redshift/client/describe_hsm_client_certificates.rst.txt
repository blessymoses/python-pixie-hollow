.. py:method:: Redshift.Client.describe_hsm_client_certificates(**kwargs)

  

  Returns information about the specified HSM client certificate. If no certificate ID is specified, returns information about all the HSM certificates owned by your Amazon Web Services account.

   

  If you specify both tag keys and tag values in the same request, Amazon Redshift returns all HSM client certificates that match any combination of the specified keys and values. For example, if you have ``owner`` and ``environment`` for tag keys, and ``admin`` and ``test`` for tag values, all HSM client certificates that have any combination of those values are returned.

   

  If both tag keys and values are omitted from the request, HSM client certificates are returned regardless of whether they have tag keys or values associated with them.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.describe_hsm_client_certificates(
        HsmClientCertificateIdentifier='string',
        MaxRecords=123,
        Marker='string',
        TagKeys=[
            'string',
        ],
        TagValues=[
            'string',
        ]
    )
    
  :type HsmClientCertificateIdentifier: string
  :param HsmClientCertificateIdentifier: 

    The identifier of a specific HSM client certificate for which you want information. If no identifier is specified, information is returned for all HSM client certificates owned by your Amazon Web Services account.

    

  
  :type MaxRecords: integer
  :param MaxRecords: 

    The maximum number of response records to return in each call. If the number of remaining response records exceeds the specified ``MaxRecords`` value, a value is returned in a ``marker`` field of the response. You can retrieve the next set of records by retrying the command with the returned marker value.

     

    Default: ``100``

     

    Constraints: minimum 20, maximum 100.

    

  
  :type Marker: string
  :param Marker: 

    An optional parameter that specifies the starting point to return a set of response records. When the results of a  DescribeHsmClientCertificates request exceed the value specified in ``MaxRecords``, Amazon Web Services returns a value in the ``Marker`` field of the response. You can retrieve the next set of response records by providing the returned marker value in the ``Marker`` parameter and retrying the request.

    

  
  :type TagKeys: list
  :param TagKeys: 

    A tag key or keys for which you want to return all matching HSM client certificates that are associated with the specified key or keys. For example, suppose that you have HSM client certificates that are tagged with keys called ``owner`` and ``environment``. If you specify both of these tag keys in the request, Amazon Redshift returns a response with the HSM client certificates that have either or both of these tag keys associated with them.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type TagValues: list
  :param TagValues: 

    A tag value or values for which you want to return all matching HSM client certificates that are associated with the specified tag value or values. For example, suppose that you have HSM client certificates that are tagged with values called ``admin`` and ``test``. If you specify both of these tag values in the request, Amazon Redshift returns a response with the HSM client certificates that have either or both of these tag values associated with them.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **Marker** *(string) --* 

        A value that indicates the starting point for the next set of response records in a subsequent request. If a value is returned in a response, you can retrieve the next set of records by providing this returned marker value in the ``Marker`` parameter and retrying the command. If the ``Marker`` field is empty, all response records have been retrieved for the request.

        
      

      - **HsmClientCertificates** *(list) --* 

        A list of the identifiers for one or more HSM client certificates used by Amazon Redshift clusters to store and retrieve database encryption keys in an HSM.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          Returns information about an HSM client certificate. The certificate is stored in a secure Hardware Storage Module (HSM), and used by the Amazon Redshift cluster to encrypt data files.

          
          

          - **HsmClientCertificateIdentifier** *(string) --* 

            The identifier of the HSM client certificate.

            
          

          - **HsmClientCertificatePublicKey** *(string) --* 

            The public key that the Amazon Redshift cluster will use to connect to the HSM. You must register the public key in the HSM.

            
          

          - **Tags** *(list) --* 

            The list of tags for the HSM client certificate.

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

              A tag consisting of a name/value pair for a resource.

              
              

              - **Key** *(string) --* 

                The key, or name, for the resource tag.

                
              

              - **Value** *(string) --* 

                The value for the resource tag.
