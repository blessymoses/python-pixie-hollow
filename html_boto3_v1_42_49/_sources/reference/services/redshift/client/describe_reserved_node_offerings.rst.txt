.. py:method:: Redshift.Client.describe_reserved_node_offerings(**kwargs)

  

  Returns a list of the available reserved node offerings by Amazon Redshift with their descriptions including the node type, the fixed and recurring costs of reserving the node and duration the node will be reserved for you. These descriptions help you determine which reserve node offering you want to purchase. You then use the unique offering ID in you call to  PurchaseReservedNodeOffering to reserve one or more nodes for your Amazon Redshift cluster.

   

  For more information about reserved node offerings, go to `Purchasing Reserved Nodes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/purchase-reserved-node-instance.html>`__ in the *Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide*.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.describe_reserved_node_offerings(
        ReservedNodeOfferingId='string',
        MaxRecords=123,
        Marker='string'
    )
    
  :type ReservedNodeOfferingId: string
  :param ReservedNodeOfferingId: 

    The unique identifier for the offering.

    

  
  :type MaxRecords: integer
  :param MaxRecords: 

    The maximum number of response records to return in each call. If the number of remaining response records exceeds the specified ``MaxRecords`` value, a value is returned in a ``marker`` field of the response. You can retrieve the next set of records by retrying the command with the returned marker value.

     

    Default: ``100``

     

    Constraints: minimum 20, maximum 100.

    

  
  :type Marker: string
  :param Marker: 

    An optional parameter that specifies the starting point to return a set of response records. When the results of a  DescribeReservedNodeOfferings request exceed the value specified in ``MaxRecords``, Amazon Web Services returns a value in the ``Marker`` field of the response. You can retrieve the next set of response records by providing the returned marker value in the ``Marker`` parameter and retrying the request.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **Marker** *(string) --* 

        A value that indicates the starting point for the next set of response records in a subsequent request. If a value is returned in a response, you can retrieve the next set of records by providing this returned marker value in the ``Marker`` parameter and retrying the command. If the ``Marker`` field is empty, all response records have been retrieved for the request.

        
      

      - **ReservedNodeOfferings** *(list) --* 

        A list of ``ReservedNodeOffering`` objects.
