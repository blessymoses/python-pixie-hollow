.. py:method:: Redshift.Client.describe_tags(**kwargs)

  

  Returns a list of tags. You can return tags from a specific resource by specifying an ARN, or you can return all tags for a given type of resource, such as clusters, snapshots, and so on.

   

  The following are limitations for ``DescribeTags``:

   

  
  * You cannot specify an ARN and a resource-type value together in the same request.
   
  * You cannot use the ``MaxRecords`` and ``Marker`` parameters together with the ARN parameter.
   
  * The ``MaxRecords`` parameter can be a range from 10 to 50 results to return in a request.
  

   

  If you specify both tag keys and tag values in the same request, Amazon Redshift returns all resources that match any combination of the specified keys and values. For example, if you have ``owner`` and ``environment`` for tag keys, and ``admin`` and ``test`` for tag values, all resources that have any combination of those values are returned.

   

  If both tag keys and values are omitted from the request, resources are returned regardless of whether they have tag keys or values associated with them.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.describe_tags(
        ResourceName='string',
        ResourceType='string',
        MaxRecords=123,
        Marker='string',
        TagKeys=[
            'string',
        ],
        TagValues=[
            'string',
        ]
    )
    
  :type ResourceName: string
  :param ResourceName: 

    The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for which you want to describe the tag or tags. For example, ``arn:aws:redshift:us-east-2:123456789:cluster:t1``.

    

  
  :type ResourceType: string
  :param ResourceType: 

    The type of resource with which you want to view tags. Valid resource types are:

     

    
    * Cluster
     
    * CIDR/IP
     
    * EC2 security group
     
    * Snapshot
     
    * Cluster security group
     
    * Subnet group
     
    * HSM connection
     
    * HSM certificate
     
    * Parameter group
     
    * Snapshot copy grant
     
    * Integration (zero-ETL integration or S3 event integration) 

    .. note::

      To describe the tags associated with an ``integration``, don't specify ``ResourceType``, instead specify the ``ResourceName`` of the integration.

  :type MaxRecords: integer
  :param MaxRecords: 

    The maximum number or response records to return in each call. If the number of remaining response records exceeds the specified ``MaxRecords`` value, a value is returned in a ``marker`` field of the response. You can retrieve the next set of records by retrying the command with the returned ``marker`` value.

    

  
  :type Marker: string
  :param Marker: 

    A value that indicates the starting point for the next set of response records in a subsequent request. If a value is returned in a response, you can retrieve the next set of records by providing this returned marker value in the ``marker`` parameter and retrying the command. If the ``marker`` field is empty, all response records have been retrieved for the request.

    

  
  :type TagKeys: list
  :param TagKeys: 

    A tag key or keys for which you want to return all matching resources that are associated with the specified key or keys. For example, suppose that you have resources tagged with keys called ``owner`` and ``environment``. If you specify both of these tag keys in the request, Amazon Redshift returns a response with all resources that have either or both of these tag keys associated with them.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type TagValues: list
  :param TagValues: 

    A tag value or values for which you want to return all matching resources that are associated with the specified value or values. For example, suppose that you have resources tagged with values called ``admin`` and ``test``. If you specify both of these tag values in the request, Amazon Redshift returns a response with all resources that have either or both of these tag values associated with them.
