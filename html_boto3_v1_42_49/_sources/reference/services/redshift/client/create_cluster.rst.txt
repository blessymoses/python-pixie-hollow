.. py:method:: Redshift.Client.create_cluster(**kwargs)

  

  Creates a new cluster with the specified parameters.

   

  To create a cluster in Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), you must provide a cluster subnet group name. The cluster subnet group identifies the subnets of your VPC that Amazon Redshift uses when creating the cluster. For more information about managing clusters, go to `Amazon Redshift Clusters <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/working-with-clusters.html>`__ in the *Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide*.

   

  VPC Block Public Access (BPA) enables you to block resources in VPCs and subnets that you own in a Region from reaching or being reached from the internet through internet gateways and egress-only internet gateways. If a subnet group for a provisioned cluster is in an account with VPC BPA turned on, the following capabilities are blocked:

   

  
  * Creating a public cluster
   
  * Restoring a public cluster
   
  * Modifying a private cluster to be public
   
  * Adding a subnet with VPC BPA turned on to the subnet group when there's at least one public cluster within the group
  

   

  For more information about VPC BPA, see `Block public access to VPCs and subnets <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/security-vpc-bpa.html>`__ in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*.
