.. py:method:: Glue.Client.get_ml_transform(**kwargs)

  

  Gets an Glue machine learning transform artifact and all its corresponding metadata. Machine learning transforms are a special type of transform that use machine learning to learn the details of the transformation to be performed by learning from examples provided by humans. These transformations are then saved by Glue. You can retrieve their metadata by calling ``GetMLTransform``.

            * ``catalogPartitionPredicate``: to use server-side partition pruning using partition indexes in the Glue Data Catalog.
            

            
            

            - *(string) --* 
              

              - *(string) --* 
        
      
      
    
      

      - **Parameters** *(dict) --* 

        The configuration parameters that are specific to the algorithm used.

        
        

        - **TransformType** *(string) --* 

          The type of machine learning transform.

           

          For information about the types of machine learning transforms, see `Creating Machine Learning Transforms <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/add-job-machine-learning-transform.html>`__.

          
        

        - **FindMatchesParameters** *(dict) --* 

          The parameters for the find matches algorithm.

          
          

          - **PrimaryKeyColumnName** *(string) --* 

            The name of a column that uniquely identifies rows in the source table. Used to help identify matching records.

            
          

          - **PrecisionRecallTradeoff** *(float) --* 

            The value selected when tuning your transform for a balance between precision and recall. A value of 0.5 means no preference; a value of 1.0 means a bias purely for precision, and a value of 0.0 means a bias for recall. Because this is a tradeoff, choosing values close to 1.0 means very low recall, and choosing values close to 0.0 results in very low precision.

             

            The precision metric indicates how often your model is correct when it predicts a match.

             

            The recall metric indicates that for an actual match, how often your model predicts the match.

            
          

          - **AccuracyCostTradeoff** *(float) --* 

            The value that is selected when tuning your transform for a balance between accuracy and cost. A value of 0.5 means that the system balances accuracy and cost concerns. A value of 1.0 means a bias purely for accuracy, which typically results in a higher cost, sometimes substantially higher. A value of 0.0 means a bias purely for cost, which results in a less accurate ``FindMatches`` transform, sometimes with unacceptable accuracy.

             

            Accuracy measures how well the transform finds true positives and true negatives. Increasing accuracy requires more machine resources and cost. But it also results in increased recall.

             

            Cost measures how many compute resources, and thus money, are consumed to run the transform.

            
          

          - **EnforceProvidedLabels** *(boolean) --* 

            The value to switch on or off to force the output to match the provided labels from users. If the value is ``True``, the ``find matches`` transform forces the output to match the provided labels. The results override the normal conflation results. If the value is ``False``, the ``find matches`` transform does not ensure all the labels provided are respected, and the results rely on the trained model.

             

            Note that setting this value to true may increase the conflation execution time.

            
      
    
      

      - **EvaluationMetrics** *(dict) --* 

        The latest evaluation metrics.

        - **FindMatchesMetrics** *(dict) --* 

          The evaluation metrics for the find matches algorithm.

          
          

          - **AreaUnderPRCurve** *(float) --* 

            The area under the precision/recall curve (AUPRC) is a single number measuring the overall quality of the transform, that is independent of the choice made for precision vs. recall. Higher values indicate that you have a more attractive precision vs. recall tradeoff.

             

            For more information, see `Precision and recall <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall>`__ in Wikipedia.

            
          

          - **Precision** *(float) --* 

            The precision metric indicates when often your transform is correct when it predicts a match. Specifically, it measures how well the transform finds true positives from the total true positives possible.

             

            For more information, see `Precision and recall <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall>`__ in Wikipedia.

            
          

          - **Recall** *(float) --* 

            The recall metric indicates that for an actual match, how often your transform predicts the match. Specifically, it measures how well the transform finds true positives from the total records in the source data.

             

            For more information, see `Precision and recall <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall>`__ in Wikipedia.

            
          

          - **F1** *(float) --* 

            The maximum F1 metric indicates the transform's accuracy between 0 and 1, where 1 is the best accuracy.

             

            For more information, see `F1 score <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_score>`__ in Wikipedia.

            
          

          - **ConfusionMatrix** *(dict) --* 

            The confusion matrix shows you what your transform is predicting accurately and what types of errors it is making.

             

            For more information, see `Confusion matrix <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix>`__ in Wikipedia.

              The number of matches in the data that the transform didn't find, in the confusion matrix for your transform.

              
        
          

          - **ColumnImportances** *(list) --* 

            A list of ``ColumnImportance`` structures containing column importance metrics, sorted in order of descending importance.

            
            

            - *(dict) --*

For more information, see `Glue Versions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/release-notes.html#release-notes-versions>`__ in the developer guide.

        
      

      - **MaxCapacity** *(float) --* 

        The number of Glue data processing units (DPUs) that are allocated to task runs for this transform. You can allocate from 2 to 100 DPUs; the default is 10. A DPU is a relative measure of processing power that consists of 4 vCPUs of compute capacity and 16 GB of memory. For more information, see the `Glue pricing page <https://aws.amazon.com/glue/pricing/>`__.

         

        When the ``WorkerType`` field is set to a value other than ``Standard``, the ``MaxCapacity`` field is set automatically and becomes read-only.

        
      

      - **WorkerType** *(string) --* 

        The type of predefined worker that is allocated when this task runs. Accepts a value of Standard, G.1X, or G.2X.
