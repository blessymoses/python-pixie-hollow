.. py:method:: Health.Client.describe_events(**kwargs)

  

  Returns information about events that meet the specified filter criteria. Events are returned in a summary form and do not include the detailed description, any additional metadata that depends on the event type, or any affected resources. To retrieve that information, use the `DescribeEventDetails <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeEventDetails.html>`__ and `DescribeAffectedEntities <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeAffectedEntities.html>`__ operations.

   

  If no filter criteria are specified, all events are returned. Results are sorted by ``lastModifiedTime``, starting with the most recent event.

   

  .. note::

    

    
    * When you call the ``DescribeEvents`` operation and specify an entity for the ``entityValues`` parameter, Health might return public events that aren't specific to that resource. For example, if you call ``DescribeEvents`` and specify an ID for an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance, Health might return events that aren't specific to that resource or service. To get events that are specific to a service, use the ``services`` parameter in the ``filter`` object. For more information, see `Event <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/APIReference/API_Event.html>`__.
     
    * This API operation uses pagination. Specify the ``nextToken`` parameter in the next request to return more results.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **events** *(list) --* 

        The events that match the specified filter criteria.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          Summary information about an Health event.

           

          Health events can be public or account-specific:

           

          
          * *Public events* might be service events that are not specific to an Amazon Web Services account. For example, if there is an issue with an Amazon Web Services Region, Health provides information about the event, even if you don't use services or resources in that Region.
           
          * *Account-specific* events are specific to either your Amazon Web Services account or an account in your organization. For example, if there's an issue with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud in a Region that you use, Health provides information about the event and the affected resources in the account.
          

           

          You can determine if an event is public or account-specific by using the ``eventScopeCode`` parameter. For more information, see `eventScopeCode <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/APIReference/API_Event.html#AWSHealth-Type-Event-eventScopeCode>`__.

          
          

          - **arn** *(string) --* 

            The unique identifier for the event. The event ARN has the ``arn:aws:health:event-region::event/SERVICE/EVENT_TYPE_CODE/EVENT_TYPE_PLUS_ID`` format.

             

            For example, an event ARN might look like the following:

             

            ``arn:aws:health:us-east-1::event/EC2/EC2_INSTANCE_RETIREMENT_SCHEDULED/EC2_INSTANCE_RETIREMENT_SCHEDULED_ABC123-DEF456``

            
          

          - **service** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Web Services service that is affected by the event. For example, ``EC2``, ``RDS``.

            
          

          - **eventTypeCode** *(string) --* 

            The unique identifier for the event type. The format is ``AWS_SERVICE_DESCRIPTION ``; for example, ``AWS_EC2_SYSTEM_MAINTENANCE_EVENT``.

            
          

          - **eventTypeCategory** *(string) --* 

            A list of event type category codes. Possible values are ``issue``, ``accountNotification``, or ``scheduledChange``. Currently, the ``investigation`` value isn't supported at this time.

            
          

          - **region** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Web Services Region name of the event.

            
          

          - **availabilityZone** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Web Services Availability Zone of the event. For example, us-east-1a.

            
          

          - **startTime** *(datetime) --* 

            The date and time that the event began.

            
          

          - **endTime** *(datetime) --* 

            The date and time that the event ended.

            
          

          - **lastUpdatedTime** *(datetime) --* 

            The most recent date and time that the event was updated.

            
          

          - **statusCode** *(string) --* 

            The most recent status of the event. Possible values are ``open``, ``closed``, and ``upcoming``.

            
          

          - **eventScopeCode** *(string) --* 

            This parameter specifies if the Health event is a public Amazon Web Services service event or an account-specific event.

             

            
            * If the ``eventScopeCode`` value is ``PUBLIC``, then the ``affectedAccounts`` value is always empty.
             
            * If the ``eventScopeCode`` value is ``ACCOUNT_SPECIFIC``, then the ``affectedAccounts`` value lists the affected Amazon Web Services accounts in your organization. For example, if an event affects a service such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud and you have Amazon Web Services accounts that use that service, those account IDs appear in the response.
             
            * If the ``eventScopeCode`` value is ``NONE``, then the ``eventArn`` that you specified in the request is invalid or doesn't exist.
            

            
          

          - **actionability** *(string) --* 

            The actionability classification of the event. Possible values are ``ACTION_REQUIRED``, ``ACTION_MAY_BE_REQUIRED`` and ``INFORMATIONAL``. Events with ``ACTION_REQUIRED`` actionability require customer action to resolve or mitigate the event. Events with ``ACTION_MAY_BE_REQUIRED`` actionability indicates that the current status is unknown or conditional and inspection is needed to determine if action is required. Events with ``INFORMATIONAL`` actionability are provided for awareness and do not require immediate action.

            
          

          - **personas** *(list) --* 

            A list of persona classifications that indicate the target audience for the event. Possible values are ``OPERATIONS``, ``SECURITY``, and ``BILLING``. Events can be associated with multiple personas to indicate relevance to different teams or roles within an organization.

            
            

            - *(string) --* 
        
      
    
      

      - **nextToken** *(string) --* 

        If the results of a search are large, only a portion of the results are returned, and a ``nextToken`` pagination token is returned in the response. To retrieve the next batch of results, reissue the search request and include the returned token. When all results have been returned, the response does not contain a pagination token value.
