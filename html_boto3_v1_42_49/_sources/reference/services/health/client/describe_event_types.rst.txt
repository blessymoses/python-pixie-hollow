.. py:method:: Health.Client.describe_event_types(**kwargs)

  

  Returns the event types that meet the specified filter criteria. You can use this API operation to find information about the Health event, such as the category, Amazon Web Services service, and event code. The metadata for each event appears in the `EventType <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/APIReference/API_EventType.html>`__ object.

   

  If you don't specify a filter criteria, the API operation returns all event types, in no particular order.

   

  .. note::

    

    This API operation uses pagination. Specify the ``nextToken`` parameter in the next request to return more results.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **eventTypes** *(list) --* 

        A list of event types that match the filter criteria. Event types have a category ( ``issue``, ``accountNotification``, or ``scheduledChange``), a service (for example, ``EC2``, ``RDS``, ``DATAPIPELINE``, ``BILLING``), and a code (in the format ``AWS_SERVICE_DESCRIPTION ``; for example, ``AWS_EC2_SYSTEM_MAINTENANCE_EVENT``).

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          Contains the metadata about a type of event that is reported by Health. The ``EventType`` shows the category, service, and the event type code of the event. For example, an ``issue`` might be the category, ``EC2`` the service, and ``AWS_EC2_SYSTEM_MAINTENANCE_EVENT`` the event type code.

           

          You can use the `DescribeEventTypes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeEventTypes.html>`__ API operation to return this information about an event.

           

          You can also use the Amazon CloudWatch Events console to create a rule so that you can get notified or take action when Health delivers a specific event to your Amazon Web Services account. For more information, see `Monitor for Health events with Amazon CloudWatch Events <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/cloudwatch-events-health.html>`__ in the *Health User Guide*.

          
          

          - **service** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Web Services service that is affected by the event. For example, ``EC2``, ``RDS``.

            
          

          - **code** *(string) --* 

            The unique identifier for the event type. The format is ``AWS_SERVICE_DESCRIPTION ``; for example, ``AWS_EC2_SYSTEM_MAINTENANCE_EVENT``.

            
          

          - **category** *(string) --* 

            A list of event type category codes. Possible values are ``issue``, ``accountNotification``, or ``scheduledChange``. Currently, the ``investigation`` value isn't supported at this time.

            
          

          - **actionability** *(string) --* 

            The actionability classification of the event. Possible values are ``ACTION_REQUIRED``, ``ACTION_MAY_BE_REQUIRED`` and ``INFORMATIONAL``. Events with ``ACTION_REQUIRED`` actionability require customer action to resolve or mitigate the event. Events with ``ACTION_MAY_BE_REQUIRED`` actionability indicates that the current status is unknown or conditional and inspection is needed to determine if action is required. Events with ``INFORMATIONAL`` actionability are provided for awareness and do not require immediate action.

            
          

          - **personas** *(list) --* 

            A list of persona classifications that indicate the target audience for the event. Possible values are ``OPERATIONS``, ``SECURITY``, and ``BILLING``. Events can be associated with multiple personas to indicate relevance to different teams or roles within an organization.

            
            

            - *(string) --* 
        
      
    
      

      - **nextToken** *(string) --* 

        If the results of a search are large, only a portion of the results are returned, and a ``nextToken`` pagination token is returned in the response. To retrieve the next batch of results, reissue the search request and include the returned token. When all results have been returned, the response does not contain a pagination token value.
