.. py:method:: Health.Client.disable_health_service_access_for_organization()

  

  Disables Health from working with Organizations. To call this operation, you must sign in to the organization's management account. For more information, see `Aggregating Health events <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/aggregate-events.html>`__ in the *Health User Guide*.

   

  This operation doesn't remove the service-linked role from the management account in your organization. You must use the IAM console, API, or Command Line Interface (CLI) to remove the service-linked role. For more information, see `Deleting a Service-Linked Role <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html#delete-service-linked-role>`__ in the *IAM User Guide*.

   

  .. note::

    

    You can also disable the organizational feature by using the Organizations `DisableAWSServiceAccess <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/APIReference/API_DisableAWSServiceAccess.html>`__ API operation. After you call this operation, Health stops aggregating events for all other Amazon Web Services accounts in your organization. If you call the Health API operations for organizational view, Health returns an error. Health continues to aggregate health events for your Amazon Web Services account.
