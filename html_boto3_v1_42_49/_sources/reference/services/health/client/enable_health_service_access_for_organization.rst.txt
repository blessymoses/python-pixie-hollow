.. py:method:: Health.Client.enable_health_service_access_for_organization()

  

  Enables Health to work with Organizations. You can use the organizational view feature to aggregate events from all Amazon Web Services accounts in your organization in a centralized location.

   

  This operation also creates a service-linked role for the management account in the organization.

   

  .. note::

    

    To call this operation, you must meet the following requirements:

     

    
    * You must have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support plan from `Amazon Web Services Support <http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/>`__ to use the Health API. If you call the Health API from an Amazon Web Services account that doesn't have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support plan, you receive a ``SubscriptionRequiredException`` error.
     
    * You must have permission to call this operation from the organization's management account. For example IAM policies, see `Health identity-based policy examples <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.html>`__.
    

    

   

  If you don't have the required support plan, you can instead use the Health console to enable the organizational view feature. For more information, see `Aggregating Health events <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/aggregate-events.html>`__ in the *Health User Guide*.
