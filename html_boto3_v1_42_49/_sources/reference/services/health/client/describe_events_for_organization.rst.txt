.. py:method:: Health.Client.describe_events_for_organization(**kwargs)

  

  Returns information about events across your organization in Organizations. You can use the ``filters`` parameter to specify the events that you want to return. Events are returned in a summary form and don't include the affected accounts, detailed description, any additional metadata that depends on the event type, or any affected resources. To retrieve that information, use the following operations:

   

  
  * `DescribeAffectedAccountsForOrganization <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeAffectedAccountsForOrganization.html>`__
   
  * `DescribeEventDetailsForOrganization <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeEventDetailsForOrganization.html>`__
   
  * `DescribeAffectedEntitiesForOrganization <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeAffectedEntitiesForOrganization.html>`__
  

   

  If you don't specify a ``filter``, the ``DescribeEventsForOrganizations`` returns all events across your organization. Results are sorted by ``lastModifiedTime``, starting with the most recent event.

   

  For more information about the different types of Health events, see `Event <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/APIReference/API_Event.html>`__.

   

  Before you can call this operation, you must first enable Health to work with Organizations. To do this, call the `EnableHealthServiceAccessForOrganization <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/APIReference/API_EnableHealthServiceAccessForOrganization.html>`__ operation from your organization's management account.

   

  .. note::

    

    This API operation uses pagination. Specify the ``nextToken`` parameter in the next request to return more results.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **events** *(list) --* 

        The events that match the specified filter criteria.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          Summary information about an event, returned by the `DescribeEventsForOrganization <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeEventsForOrganization.html>`__ operation.

          
          

          - **arn** *(string) --* 

            The unique identifier for the event. The event ARN has the ``arn:aws:health:event-region::event/SERVICE/EVENT_TYPE_CODE/EVENT_TYPE_PLUS_ID`` format.

             

            For example, an event ARN might look like the following:

             

            ``arn:aws:health:us-east-1::event/EC2/EC2_INSTANCE_RETIREMENT_SCHEDULED/EC2_INSTANCE_RETIREMENT_SCHEDULED_ABC123-DEF456``

            
          

          - **service** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Web Services service that is affected by the event, such as EC2 and RDS.

            
          

          - **eventTypeCode** *(string) --* 

            The unique identifier for the event type. The format is ``AWS_SERVICE_DESCRIPTION``. For example, ``AWS_EC2_SYSTEM_MAINTENANCE_EVENT``.

            
          

          - **eventTypeCategory** *(string) --* 

            A list of event type category codes. Possible values are ``issue``, ``accountNotification``, or ``scheduledChange``. Currently, the ``investigation`` value isn't supported at this time.

            
          

          - **eventScopeCode** *(string) --* 

            This parameter specifies if the Health event is a public Amazon Web Services service event or an account-specific event.

             

            
            * If the ``eventScopeCode`` value is ``PUBLIC``, then the ``affectedAccounts`` value is always empty.
             
            * If the ``eventScopeCode`` value is ``ACCOUNT_SPECIFIC``, then the ``affectedAccounts`` value lists the affected Amazon Web Services accounts in your organization. For example, if an event affects a service such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud and you have Amazon Web Services accounts that use that service, those account IDs appear in the response.
             
            * If the ``eventScopeCode`` value is ``NONE``, then the ``eventArn`` that you specified in the request is invalid or doesn't exist.
            

            
          

          - **region** *(string) --*

          - **lastUpdatedTime** *(datetime) --* 

            The most recent date and time that the event was updated.

            
          

          - **statusCode** *(string) --*

          - **actionability** *(string) --* 

            The actionability classification of the event. Possible values are ``ACTION_REQUIRED``, ``ACTION_MAY_BE_REQUIRED`` and ``INFORMATIONAL``. Events with ``ACTION_REQUIRED`` actionability require customer action to resolve or mitigate the event. Events with ``ACTION_MAY_BE_REQUIRED`` actionability indicates that the current status is unknown or conditional and inspection is needed to determine if action is required. Events with ``INFORMATIONAL`` actionability are provided for awareness and do not require immediate action.

            
          

          - **personas** *(list) --* 

            A list of persona classifications that indicate the target audience for the event. Possible values are ``OPERATIONS``, ``SECURITY``, and ``BILLING``.

      - **nextToken** *(string) --* 

        If the results of a search are large, only a portion of the results are returned, and a ``nextToken`` pagination token is returned in the response. To retrieve the next batch of results, reissue the search request and include the returned token. When all results have been returned, the response does not contain a pagination token value.
