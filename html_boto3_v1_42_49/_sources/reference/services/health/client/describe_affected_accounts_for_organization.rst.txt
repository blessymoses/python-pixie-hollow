.. py:method:: Health.Client.describe_affected_accounts_for_organization(**kwargs)

  

  Returns a list of accounts in the organization from Organizations that are affected by the provided event. For more information about the different types of Health events, see `Event <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/APIReference/API_Event.html>`__.

   

  Before you can call this operation, you must first enable Health to work with Organizations. To do this, call the `EnableHealthServiceAccessForOrganization <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/APIReference/API_EnableHealthServiceAccessForOrganization.html>`__ operation from your organization's management account.

   

  .. note::

    

    This API operation uses pagination. Specify the ``nextToken`` parameter in the next request to return more results.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.describe_affected_accounts_for_organization(
        eventArn='string',
        nextToken='string',
        maxResults=123
    )
    
  :type eventArn: string
  :param eventArn: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The unique identifier for the event. The event ARN has the ``arn:aws:health:event-region::event/SERVICE/EVENT_TYPE_CODE/EVENT_TYPE_PLUS_ID`` format.

     

    For example, an event ARN might look like the following:

     

    ``arn:aws:health:us-east-1::event/EC2/EC2_INSTANCE_RETIREMENT_SCHEDULED/EC2_INSTANCE_RETIREMENT_SCHEDULED_ABC123-DEF456``

    

  
  :type nextToken: string
  :param nextToken: 

    If the results of a search are large, only a portion of the results are returned, and a ``nextToken`` pagination token is returned in the response. To retrieve the next batch of results, reissue the search request and include the returned token. When all results have been returned, the response does not contain a pagination token value.

    

  
  :type maxResults: integer
  :param maxResults: 

    The maximum number of items to return in one batch, between 10 and 100, inclusive.

    **Response Syntax**

    
    ::

      {
          'affectedAccounts': [
              'string',
          ],
          'eventScopeCode': 'PUBLIC'|'ACCOUNT_SPECIFIC'|'NONE',
          'nextToken': 'string'
      }
      
    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **affectedAccounts** *(list) --* 

        A JSON set of elements of the affected accounts.

        
        

        - *(string) --* 
    
      

      - **eventScopeCode** *(string) --* 

        This parameter specifies if the Health event is a public Amazon Web Services service event or an account-specific event.

         

        
        * If the ``eventScopeCode`` value is ``PUBLIC``, then the ``affectedAccounts`` value is always empty.
         
        * If the ``eventScopeCode`` value is ``ACCOUNT_SPECIFIC``, then the ``affectedAccounts`` value lists the affected Amazon Web Services accounts in your organization. For example, if an event affects a service such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud and you have Amazon Web Services accounts that use that service, those account IDs appear in the response.
         
        * If the ``eventScopeCode`` value is ``NONE``, then the ``eventArn`` that you specified in the request is invalid or doesn't exist.
        

        
      

      - **nextToken** *(string) --* 

        If the results of a search are large, only a portion of the results are returned, and a ``nextToken`` pagination token is returned in the response. To retrieve the next batch of results, reissue the search request and include the returned token. When all results have been returned, the response does not contain a pagination token value.
