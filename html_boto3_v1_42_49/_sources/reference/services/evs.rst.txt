.. py:class:: EVS.Client

  A low-level client representing Amazon Elastic VMware Service (EVS)
  

  Amazon Elastic VMware Service (Amazon EVS) is a service that you can use to deploy a VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) software environment directly on EC2 bare metal instances within an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).

   

  Workloads running on Amazon EVS are fully compatible with workloads running on any standard VMware vSphere environment. This means that you can migrate any VMware-based workload to Amazon EVS without workload modification.

  ::

    
    import boto3
    
    client = boto3.client('evs')
