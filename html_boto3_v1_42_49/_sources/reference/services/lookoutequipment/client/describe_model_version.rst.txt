For example, if you provide data that has been collected at a 1 second level and you want the system to resample the data at a 1 minute rate before training, the ``TargetSamplingRate`` is 1 minute.

         

        When providing a value for the ``TargetSamplingRate``, you must attach the prefix "PT" to the rate you want. The value for a 1 second rate is therefore *PT1S*, the value for a 15 minute rate is *PT15M*, and the value for a 1 hour rate is *PT1H*

      - **AutoPromotionResultReason** *(string) --* 

        Indicates the reason for the ``AutoPromotionResult``. For example, a model might not be promoted if its performance was worse than the active version, if there was an error during training, or if the retraining scheduler was using ``MANUAL`` promote mode. The model will be promoted in ``MANAGED`` promote mode if the performance is better than the previous model.

        
      

      - **ModelDiagnosticsOutputConfiguration** *(dict) --* 

        The Amazon S3 location where Amazon Lookout for Equipment saves the pointwise model diagnostics for the model version.

            When you call ``CreateModel`` or ``UpdateModel``, specify the path within the bucket that you want Lookout for Equipment to save the model to. During training, Lookout for Equipment creates the model evaluation model as a compressed JSON file with the name ``model_diagnostics_results.json.gz``.

             

            When you call ``DescribeModel`` or ``DescribeModelVersion``, ``prefix`` contains the file path and filename of the model evaluation file.

            
      
        

        - **KmsKeyId** *(string) --*

        - **Bucket** *(string) --* 

          The name of the specific S3 bucket.

          
        

        - **Key** *(string) --* 

          The Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (KMS key) key being used to encrypt the S3 object. Without this key, data in the bucket is not accessible.

          
    
      

      - **ModelQuality** *(string) --* 

        Provides a quality assessment for a model that uses labels. If Lookout for Equipment determines that the model quality is poor based on training metrics, the value is ``POOR_QUALITY_DETECTED``. Otherwise, the value is ``QUALITY_THRESHOLD_MET``.

         

        If the model is unlabeled, the model quality can't be assessed and the value of ``ModelQuality`` is ``CANNOT_DETERMINE_QUALITY``. In this situation, you can get a model quality assessment by adding labels to the input dataset and retraining the model.
