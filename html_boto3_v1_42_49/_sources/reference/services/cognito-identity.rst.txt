.. py:class:: CognitoIdentity.Client

  A low-level client representing Amazon Cognito Identity
   

  Amazon Cognito Federated Identities is a web service that delivers scoped temporary credentials to mobile devices and other untrusted environments. It uniquely identifies a device and supplies the user with a consistent identity over the lifetime of an application.

   

  Using Amazon Cognito Federated Identities, you can enable authentication with one or more third-party identity providers (Facebook, Google, or Login with Amazon) or an Amazon Cognito user pool, and you can also choose to support unauthenticated access from your app. Cognito delivers a unique identifier for each user and acts as an OpenID token provider trusted by Security Token Service (STS) to access temporary, limited-privilege Amazon Web Services credentials.

   

  For a description of the authentication flow from the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide see `Authentication Flow <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/authentication-flow.html>`__.

   

  For more information see `Amazon Cognito Federated Identities <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-identity.html>`__.
