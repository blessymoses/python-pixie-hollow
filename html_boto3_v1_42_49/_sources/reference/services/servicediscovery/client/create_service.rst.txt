.. py:method:: ServiceDiscovery.Client.create_service(**kwargs)

  

  Creates a service. This action defines the configuration for the following entities:

   

  
  * For public and private DNS namespaces, one of the following combinations of DNS records in Amazon Route 53: 

    
    * ``A``
     
    * ``AAAA``
     
    * ``A`` and ``AAAA``
     
    * ``SRV``
     
    * ``CNAME``
    

  
   
  * Optionally, a health check
  

   

  After you create the service, you can submit a `RegisterInstance <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/api/API_RegisterInstance.html>`__ request, and Cloud Map uses the values in the configuration to create the specified entities.

   

  For the current quota on the number of instances that you can register using the same namespace and using the same service, see `Cloud Map quotas <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/dg/cloud-map-limits.html>`__ in the *Cloud Map Developer Guide*.

        ],
        Type='HTTP'
    )
    
  :type Name: string
  :param Name: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name that you want to assign to the service.

     

    .. note::

      

      Do not include sensitive information in the name if the namespace is discoverable by public DNS queries.

      

     

    If you want Cloud Map to create an ``SRV`` record when you register an instance and you're using a system that requires a specific ``SRV`` format, such as `HAProxy <http://www.haproxy.org/>`__, specify the following for ``Name``:

     

    
    * Start the name with an underscore (_), such as ``_exampleservice``.
     
    * End the name with *._protocol*, such as ``._tcp``.
    

     

    When you register an instance, Cloud Map creates an ``SRV`` record and assigns a name to the record by concatenating the service name and the namespace name (for example,

     

    ``_exampleservice._tcp.example.com``).

     

    .. note::

      

      For services that are accessible by DNS queries, you can't create multiple services with names that differ only by case (such as EXAMPLE and example). Otherwise, these services have the same DNS name and can't be distinguished. However, if you use a namespace that's only accessible by API calls, then you can create services that with names that differ only by case.

      

    

  
  :type NamespaceId: string
  :param NamespaceId: 

    The ID or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the namespace that you want to use to create the service. For namespaces shared with your Amazon Web Services account, specify the namespace ARN. For more information about shared namespaces, see `Cross-account Cloud Map namespace sharing <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/dg/sharing-namespaces.html>`__ in the *Cloud Map Developer Guide*.

    

  
  :type CreatorRequestId: string
  :param CreatorRequestId: 

    A unique string that identifies the request and that allows failed ``CreateService`` requests to be retried without the risk of running the operation twice. ``CreatorRequestId`` can be any unique string (for example, a date/timestamp).

    This field is autopopulated if not provided.

  
  :type Description: string
  :param Description: 

    A description for the service.

    

  
  :type DnsConfig: dict
  :param DnsConfig: 

    A complex type that contains information about the Amazon Route 53 records that you want Cloud Map to create when you register an instance.

    

  
    - **NamespaceId** *(string) --* 

      Use NamespaceId in `Service <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/api/API_Service.html>`__ instead.

       

      The ID of the namespace to use for DNS configuration.

      

    
    - **RoutingPolicy** *(string) --* 

      The routing policy that you want to apply to all Route 53 DNS records that Cloud Map creates when you register an instance and specify this service.

       

      .. note::

        

        If you want to use this service to register instances that create alias records, specify ``WEIGHTED`` for the routing policy.

        

       

      You can specify the following values:

        MULTIVALUE  

      If you define a health check for the service and the health check is healthy, Route 53 returns the applicable value for up to eight instances.

       

      For example, suppose that the service includes configurations for one ``A`` record and a health check. You use the service to register 10 instances. Route 53 responds to DNS queries with IP addresses for up to eight healthy instances. If fewer than eight instances are healthy, Route 53 responds to every DNS query with the IP addresses for all of the healthy instances.

       

      If you don't define a health check for the service, Route 53 assumes that all instances are healthy and returns the values for up to eight instances.

       

      For more information about the multivalue routing policy, see `Multivalue Answer Routing <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html#routing-policy-multivalue>`__ in the *Route 53 Developer Guide*.

        WEIGHTED  

      Route 53 returns the applicable value from one randomly selected instance from among the instances that you registered using the same service. Currently, all records have the same weight, so you can't route more or less traffic to any instances.

       

      For example, suppose that the service includes configurations for one ``A`` record and a health check. You use the service to register 10 instances. Route 53 responds to DNS queries with the IP address for one randomly selected instance from among the healthy instances. If no instances are healthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries as if all of the instances were healthy.

       

      If you don't define a health check for the service, Route 53 assumes that all instances are healthy and returns the applicable value for one randomly selected instance.

       

      For more information about the weighted routing policy, see `Weighted Routing <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html#routing-policy-weighted>`__ in the *Route 53 Developer Guide*.

      

    
    - **DnsRecords** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      An array that contains one ``DnsRecord`` object for each Route 53 DNS record that you want Cloud Map to create when you register an instance.

       

      .. warning::

         

        The record type of a service specified in a ``DnsRecord`` object can't be updated. To change a record type, you need to delete the service and recreate it with a new ``DnsConfig``.

        

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        A complex type that contains information about the Route 53 DNS records that you want Cloud Map to create when you register an instance.

        

      
        - **Type** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The type of the resource, which indicates the type of value that Route 53 returns in response to DNS queries. You can specify values for ``Type`` in the following combinations:

           

          
          * ``A``
           
          * ``AAAA``
           
          * ``A`` and ``AAAA``
           
          * ``SRV``
           
          * ``CNAME``
          

           

          If you want Cloud Map to create a Route 53 alias record when you register an instance, specify ``A`` or ``AAAA`` for ``Type``.

           

          You specify other settings, such as the IP address for ``A`` and ``AAAA`` records, when you register an instance. For more information, see `RegisterInstance <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/api/API_RegisterInstance.html>`__.

           

          The following values are supported:

            A  

          Route 53 returns the IP address of the resource in IPv4 format, such as 192.0.2.44.

            AAAA  

          Route 53 returns the IP address of the resource in IPv6 format, such as 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345.

            CNAME  

          Route 53 returns the domain name of the resource, such as www.example.com. Note the following:

           

          
          * You specify the domain name that you want to route traffic to when you register an instance. For more information, see `Attributes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/api/API_RegisterInstance.html#cloudmap-RegisterInstance-request-Attributes>`__ in the topic `RegisterInstance <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/api/API_RegisterInstance.html>`__.
           
          * You must specify ``WEIGHTED`` for the value of ``RoutingPolicy``.
           
          * You can't specify both ``CNAME`` for ``Type`` and settings for ``HealthCheckConfig``. If you do, the request will fail with an ``InvalidInput`` error.
          

            SRV  

          Route 53 returns the value for an ``SRV`` record. The value for an ``SRV`` record uses the following values:

           

          ``priority weight port service-hostname``

           

          Note the following about the values:

           

          
          * The values of ``priority`` and ``weight`` are both set to ``1`` and can't be changed.
           
          * The value of ``port`` comes from the value that you specify for the ``AWS_INSTANCE_PORT`` attribute when you submit a `RegisterInstance <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/api/API_RegisterInstance.html>`__ request.
           
          * The value of ``service-hostname`` is a concatenation of the following values: 

            
            * The value that you specify for ``InstanceId`` when you register an instance.
             
            * The name of the service.
             
            * The name of the namespace.
            

           

          For example, if the value of ``InstanceId`` is ``test``, the name of the service is ``backend``, and the name of the namespace is ``example.com``, the value of ``service-hostname`` is the following:

           

          ``test.backend.example.com``

          
          

           

          If you specify settings for an ``SRV`` record, note the following:

           

          
          * If you specify values for ``AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4``, ``AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6``, or both in the ``RegisterInstance`` request, Cloud Map automatically creates ``A`` and/or ``AAAA`` records that have the same name as the value of ``service-hostname`` in the ``SRV`` record. You can ignore these records.
           
          * If you're using a system that requires a specific ``SRV`` format, such as HAProxy, see the `Name <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/api/API_CreateService.html#cloudmap-CreateService-request-Name>`__ element in the documentation about ``CreateService`` for information about how to specify the correct name format.
          

          

        
        - **TTL** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The amount of time, in seconds, that you want DNS resolvers to cache the settings for this record.

           

          .. note::

            

            Alias records don't include a TTL because Route 53 uses the TTL for the Amazon Web Services resource that an alias record routes traffic to. If you include the ``AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME`` attribute when you submit a `RegisterInstance <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/api/API_RegisterInstance.html>`__ request, the ``TTL`` value is ignored. Always specify a TTL for the service; you can use a service to register instances that create either alias or non-alias records.

            

          

        
      
  
  
  :type HealthCheckConfig: dict
  :param HealthCheckConfig: 

    *Public DNS and HTTP namespaces only.* A complex type that contains settings for an optional Route 53 health check. If you specify settings for a health check, Cloud Map associates the health check with all the Route 53 DNS records that you specify in ``DnsConfig``.

     

    .. warning::

       

      If you specify a health check configuration, you can specify either ``HealthCheckCustomConfig`` or ``HealthCheckConfig`` but not both.

       

     

    For information about the charges for health checks, see `Cloud Map Pricing <http://aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/pricing/>`__.

    

  
    - **Type** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The type of health check that you want to create, which indicates how Route 53 determines whether an endpoint is healthy.

       

      .. warning::

         

        You can't change the value of ``Type`` after you create a health check.

         

       

      You can create the following types of health checks:

       

      
      * **HTTP**: Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53 submits an HTTP request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.
       
      * **HTTPS**: Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53 submits an HTTPS request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400. 

      .. warning::

        If you specify HTTPS for the value of ``Type``, the endpoint must support TLS v1.0 or later.

      
       
      * **TCP**: Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If you specify ``TCP`` for ``Type``, don't specify a value for ``ResourcePath``.
      

       

      For more information, see `How Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__ in the *Route 53 Developer Guide*.

      

    
    - **ResourcePath** *(string) --* 

      The path that you want Route 53 to request when performing health checks. The path can be any value that your endpoint returns an HTTP status code of a 2xx or 3xx format for when the endpoint is healthy. An example file is ``/docs/route53-health-check.html``. Route 53 automatically adds the DNS name for the service. If you don't specify a value for ``ResourcePath``, the default value is ``/``.

       

      If you specify ``TCP`` for ``Type``, you must *not* specify a value for ``ResourcePath``.

      

    
    - **FailureThreshold** *(integer) --* 

      The number of consecutive health checks that an endpoint must pass or fail for Route 53 to change the current status of the endpoint from unhealthy to healthy or the other way around. For more information, see `How Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__ in the *Route 53 Developer Guide*.

      

    
  
  :type HealthCheckCustomConfig: dict
  :param HealthCheckCustomConfig: 

    A complex type that contains information about an optional custom health check.

     

    .. warning::

       

      If you specify a health check configuration, you can specify either ``HealthCheckCustomConfig`` or ``HealthCheckConfig`` but not both.

       

     

    You can't add, update, or delete a ``HealthCheckCustomConfig`` configuration from an existing service.

    

  
    - **FailureThreshold** *(integer) --* 

      .. warning::

        

        This parameter is no longer supported and is always set to 1. Cloud Map waits for approximately 30 seconds after receiving an ``UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus`` request before changing the status of the service instance.

         

       

      The number of 30-second intervals that you want Cloud Map to wait after receiving an ``UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus`` request before it changes the health status of a service instance.

       

      Sending a second or subsequent ``UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus`` request with the same value before 30 seconds has passed doesn't accelerate the change. Cloud Map still waits ``30`` seconds after the first request to make the change.

      

    
  
  :type Tags: list
  :param Tags: 

    The tags to add to the service. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value that you define. Tags keys can be up to 128 characters in length, and tag values can be up to 256 characters in length.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      A custom key-value pair that's associated with a resource.

      

    
      - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The key identifier, or name, of the tag.

        

      
      - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The string value that's associated with the key of the tag. You can set the value of a tag to an empty string, but you can't set the value of a tag to null.

        

      
    

  :type Type: string
  :param Type: 

    If present, specifies that the service instances are only discoverable using the ``DiscoverInstances`` API operation. No DNS records is registered for the service instances. The only valid value is ``HTTP``.

              If you want to use this service to register instances that create alias records, specify ``WEIGHTED`` for the routing policy.

              

             

            You can specify the following values:

              MULTIVALUE  

            If you define a health check for the service and the health check is healthy, Route 53 returns the applicable value for up to eight instances.

             

            For example, suppose that the service includes configurations for one ``A`` record and a health check. You use the service to register 10 instances. Route 53 responds to DNS queries with IP addresses for up to eight healthy instances. If fewer than eight instances are healthy, Route 53 responds to every DNS query with the IP addresses for all of the healthy instances.

             

            If you don't define a health check for the service, Route 53 assumes that all instances are healthy and returns the values for up to eight instances.

             

            For more information about the multivalue routing policy, see `Multivalue Answer Routing <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html#routing-policy-multivalue>`__ in the *Route 53 Developer Guide*.

              WEIGHTED  

            Route 53 returns the applicable value from one randomly selected instance from among the instances that you registered using the same service. Currently, all records have the same weight, so you can't route more or less traffic to any instances.

             

            For example, suppose that the service includes configurations for one ``A`` record and a health check. You use the service to register 10 instances. Route 53 responds to DNS queries with the IP address for one randomly selected instance from among the healthy instances. If no instances are healthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries as if all of the instances were healthy.

             

            If you don't define a health check for the service, Route 53 assumes that all instances are healthy and returns the applicable value for one randomly selected instance.

             

            For more information about the weighted routing policy, see `Weighted Routing <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html#routing-policy-weighted>`__ in the *Route 53 Developer Guide*.

            
          

          - **DnsRecords** *(list) --* 

            An array that contains one ``DnsRecord`` object for each Route 53 DNS record that you want Cloud Map to create when you register an instance.

             

            .. warning::

               

              The record type of a service specified in a ``DnsRecord`` object can't be updated. To change a record type, you need to delete the service and recreate it with a new ``DnsConfig``.

              

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

              A complex type that contains information about the Route 53 DNS records that you want Cloud Map to create when you register an instance.

              
              

              - **Type** *(string) --* 

                The type of the resource, which indicates the type of value that Route 53 returns in response to DNS queries. You can specify values for ``Type`` in the following combinations:

                 

                
                * ``A``
                 
                * ``AAAA``
                 
                * ``A`` and ``AAAA``
                 
                * ``SRV``
                 
                * ``CNAME``
                

                 

                If you want Cloud Map to create a Route 53 alias record when you register an instance, specify ``A`` or ``AAAA`` for ``Type``.

                 

                You specify other settings, such as the IP address for ``A`` and ``AAAA`` records, when you register an instance. For more information, see `RegisterInstance <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/api/API_RegisterInstance.html>`__.

                 

                The following values are supported:

                  A  

                Route 53 returns the IP address of the resource in IPv4 format, such as 192.0.2.44.

                  AAAA  

                Route 53 returns the IP address of the resource in IPv6 format, such as 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345.

                  CNAME  

                Route 53 returns the domain name of the resource, such as www.example.com. Note the following:

                 

                
                * You specify the domain name that you want to route traffic to when you register an instance. For more information, see `Attributes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/api/API_RegisterInstance.html#cloudmap-RegisterInstance-request-Attributes>`__ in the topic `RegisterInstance <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/api/API_RegisterInstance.html>`__.
                 
                * You must specify ``WEIGHTED`` for the value of ``RoutingPolicy``.
                 
                * You can't specify both ``CNAME`` for ``Type`` and settings for ``HealthCheckConfig``. If you do, the request will fail with an ``InvalidInput`` error.
                

                  SRV  

                Route 53 returns the value for an ``SRV`` record. The value for an ``SRV`` record uses the following values:

                 

                ``priority weight port service-hostname``

                 

                Note the following about the values:

                 

                
                * The values of ``priority`` and ``weight`` are both set to ``1`` and can't be changed.
                 
                * The value of ``port`` comes from the value that you specify for the ``AWS_INSTANCE_PORT`` attribute when you submit a `RegisterInstance <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/api/API_RegisterInstance.html>`__ request.
                 
                * The value of ``service-hostname`` is a concatenation of the following values: 

                  
                  * The value that you specify for ``InstanceId`` when you register an instance.
                   
                  * The name of the service.
                   
                  * The name of the namespace.
                  

                 

                For example, if the value of ``InstanceId`` is ``test``, the name of the service is ``backend``, and the name of the namespace is ``example.com``, the value of ``service-hostname`` is the following:

                 

                ``test.backend.example.com``

                
                

                 

                If you specify settings for an ``SRV`` record, note the following:

                 

                
                * If you specify values for ``AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4``, ``AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6``, or both in the ``RegisterInstance`` request, Cloud Map automatically creates ``A`` and/or ``AAAA`` records that have the same name as the value of ``service-hostname`` in the ``SRV`` record. You can ignore these records.
                 
                * If you're using a system that requires a specific ``SRV`` format, such as HAProxy, see the `Name <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/api/API_CreateService.html#cloudmap-CreateService-request-Name>`__ element in the documentation about ``CreateService`` for information about how to specify the correct name format.
                

                
              

              - **TTL** *(integer) --* 

                The amount of time, in seconds, that you want DNS resolvers to cache the settings for this record.

                 

                .. note::

                  

                  Alias records don't include a TTL because Route 53 uses the TTL for the Amazon Web Services resource that an alias record routes traffic to. If you include the ``AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME`` attribute when you submit a `RegisterInstance <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/api/API_RegisterInstance.html>`__ request, the ``TTL`` value is ignored. Always specify a TTL for the service; you can use a service to register instances that create either alias or non-alias records.

                  

                
          
        
      
        

        - **Type** *(string) --* 

          Describes the systems that can be used to discover the service instances.

            DNS_HTTP  

          The service instances can be discovered using either DNS queries or the ``DiscoverInstances`` API operation.

            HTTP  

          The service instances can only be discovered using the ``DiscoverInstances`` API operation.

            DNS  

          Reserved.

          
        

        - **HealthCheckConfig** *(dict) --* 

          *Public DNS and HTTP namespaces only.* A complex type that contains settings for an optional health check. If you specify settings for a health check, Cloud Map associates the health check with the records that you specify in ``DnsConfig``.

           

          For information about the charges for health checks, see `Amazon Route 53 Pricing <http://aws.amazon.com/route53/pricing/>`__.

          
          

          - **Type** *(string) --* 

            The type of health check that you want to create, which indicates how Route 53 determines whether an endpoint is healthy.

             

            .. warning::

               

              You can't change the value of ``Type`` after you create a health check.

               

             

            You can create the following types of health checks:

             

            
            * **HTTP**: Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53 submits an HTTP request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.
             
            * **HTTPS**: Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53 submits an HTTPS request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400. 

            .. warning::

              If you specify HTTPS for the value of ``Type``, the endpoint must support TLS v1.0 or later.

            
             
            * **TCP**: Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If you specify ``TCP`` for ``Type``, don't specify a value for ``ResourcePath``.
            

             

            For more information, see `How Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__ in the *Route 53 Developer Guide*.

            
          

          - **ResourcePath** *(string) --* 

            The path that you want Route 53 to request when performing health checks. The path can be any value that your endpoint returns an HTTP status code of a 2xx or 3xx format for when the endpoint is healthy. An example file is ``/docs/route53-health-check.html``. Route 53 automatically adds the DNS name for the service. If you don't specify a value for ``ResourcePath``, the default value is ``/``.

             

            If you specify ``TCP`` for ``Type``, you must *not* specify a value for ``ResourcePath``.

            
          

          - **FailureThreshold** *(integer) --* 

            The number of consecutive health checks that an endpoint must pass or fail for Route 53 to change the current status of the endpoint from unhealthy to healthy or the other way around. For more information, see `How Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__ in the *Route 53 Developer Guide*.

            
      
        

        - **HealthCheckCustomConfig** *(dict) --* 

          A complex type that contains information about an optional custom health check.

           

          .. warning::

             

            If you specify a health check configuration, you can specify either ``HealthCheckCustomConfig`` or ``HealthCheckConfig`` but not both.

            

          
          

          - **FailureThreshold** *(integer) --* 

            .. warning::

              

              This parameter is no longer supported and is always set to 1. Cloud Map waits for approximately 30 seconds after receiving an ``UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus`` request before changing the status of the service instance.

               

             

            The number of 30-second intervals that you want Cloud Map to wait after receiving an ``UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus`` request before it changes the health status of a service instance.

             

            Sending a second or subsequent ``UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus`` request with the same value before 30 seconds has passed doesn't accelerate the change. Cloud Map still waits ``30`` seconds after the first request to make the change.

            
      
        

        - **CreateDate** *(datetime) --* 

          The date and time that the service was created, in Unix format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of ``CreateDate`` is accurate to milliseconds. For example, the value ``1516925490.087`` represents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.

          
        

        - **CreatorRequestId** *(string) --* 

          A unique string that identifies the request and that allows failed requests to be retried without the risk of running the operation twice. ``CreatorRequestId`` can be any unique string (for example, a date/timestamp).

          
        

        - **CreatedByAccount** *(string) --* 

          The ID of the Amazon Web Services account that created the service. If this isn't your account ID, it is the ID of account of the namespace owner or of another account with which the namespace has been shared. For more information about shared namespaces, see `Cross-account Cloud Map namespace sharing <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/dg/sharing-namespaces.html>`__ in the *Cloud Map Developer Guide*.
