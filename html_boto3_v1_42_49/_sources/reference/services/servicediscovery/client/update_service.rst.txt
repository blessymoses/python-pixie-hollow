.. py:method:: ServiceDiscovery.Client.update_service(**kwargs)

  

  Submits a request to perform the following operations:

   

  
  * Update the TTL setting for existing ``DnsRecords`` configurations
   
  * Add, update, or delete ``HealthCheckConfig`` for a specified service 

  .. note::

    You can't add, update, or delete a ``HealthCheckCustomConfig`` configuration.

  
  

   

  For public and private DNS namespaces, note the following:

   

  
  * If you omit any existing ``DnsRecords`` or ``HealthCheckConfig`` configurations from an ``UpdateService`` request, the configurations are deleted from the service.
   
  * If you omit an existing ``HealthCheckCustomConfig`` configuration from an ``UpdateService`` request, the configuration isn't deleted from the service.
  

   

  .. note::

    

    You can't call ``UpdateService`` and update settings in the following scenarios:

     

    
    * When the service is associated with an HTTP namespace
     
    * When the service is associated with a shared namespace and contains instances that were registered by Amazon Web Services accounts other than the account making the ``UpdateService`` call
    

    

   

  When you update settings for a service, Cloud Map also updates the corresponding settings in all the records and health checks that were created by using the specified service.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.update_service(
        Id='string',
        Service={
            'Description': 'string',
            'DnsConfig': {
                'DnsRecords': [
                    {
                        'Type': 'SRV'|'A'|'AAAA'|'CNAME',
                        'TTL': 123
                    },
                ]
            },
            'HealthCheckConfig': {
                'Type': 'HTTP'|'HTTPS'|'TCP',
                'ResourcePath': 'string',
                'FailureThreshold': 123
            }
        }
    )
    
  :type Id: string
  :param Id: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ID or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the service that you want to update. If the namespace associated with the service is shared with your Amazon Web Services account, specify the service ARN. For more information about shared namespaces, see `Cross-account Cloud Map namespace sharing <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/dg/sharing-namespaces.html>`__ in the *Cloud Map Developer Guide*

    

  
  :type Service: dict
  :param Service: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A complex type that contains the new settings for the service. You can specify a maximum of 30 attributes (key-value pairs).

    

  
    - **Description** *(string) --* 

      A description for the service.

      

    
    - **DnsConfig** *(dict) --* 

      Information about the Route 53 DNS records that you want Cloud Map to create when you register an instance.

      

    
      - **DnsRecords** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        An array that contains one ``DnsRecord`` object for each Route 53 record that you want Cloud Map to create when you register an instance.

        

      
        - *(dict) --* 

          A complex type that contains information about the Route 53 DNS records that you want Cloud Map to create when you register an instance.

          

        
          - **Type** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The type of the resource, which indicates the type of value that Route 53 returns in response to DNS queries. You can specify values for ``Type`` in the following combinations:

             

            
            * ``A``
             
            * ``AAAA``
             
            * ``A`` and ``AAAA``
             
            * ``SRV``
             
            * ``CNAME``
            

             

            If you want Cloud Map to create a Route 53 alias record when you register an instance, specify ``A`` or ``AAAA`` for ``Type``.

             

            You specify other settings, such as the IP address for ``A`` and ``AAAA`` records, when you register an instance. For more information, see `RegisterInstance <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/api/API_RegisterInstance.html>`__.

             

            The following values are supported:

              A  

            Route 53 returns the IP address of the resource in IPv4 format, such as 192.0.2.44.

              AAAA  

            Route 53 returns the IP address of the resource in IPv6 format, such as 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345.

              CNAME  

            Route 53 returns the domain name of the resource, such as www.example.com. Note the following:

             

            
            * You specify the domain name that you want to route traffic to when you register an instance. For more information, see `Attributes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/api/API_RegisterInstance.html#cloudmap-RegisterInstance-request-Attributes>`__ in the topic `RegisterInstance <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/api/API_RegisterInstance.html>`__.
             
            * You must specify ``WEIGHTED`` for the value of ``RoutingPolicy``.
             
            * You can't specify both ``CNAME`` for ``Type`` and settings for ``HealthCheckConfig``. If you do, the request will fail with an ``InvalidInput`` error.
            

              SRV  

            Route 53 returns the value for an ``SRV`` record. The value for an ``SRV`` record uses the following values:

             

            ``priority weight port service-hostname``

             

            Note the following about the values:

             

            
            * The values of ``priority`` and ``weight`` are both set to ``1`` and can't be changed.
             
            * The value of ``port`` comes from the value that you specify for the ``AWS_INSTANCE_PORT`` attribute when you submit a `RegisterInstance <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/api/API_RegisterInstance.html>`__ request.
             
            * The value of ``service-hostname`` is a concatenation of the following values: 

              
              * The value that you specify for ``InstanceId`` when you register an instance.
               
              * The name of the service.
               
              * The name of the namespace.
              

             

            For example, if the value of ``InstanceId`` is ``test``, the name of the service is ``backend``, and the name of the namespace is ``example.com``, the value of ``service-hostname`` is the following:

             

            ``test.backend.example.com``

            
            

             

            If you specify settings for an ``SRV`` record, note the following:

             

            
            * If you specify values for ``AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4``, ``AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6``, or both in the ``RegisterInstance`` request, Cloud Map automatically creates ``A`` and/or ``AAAA`` records that have the same name as the value of ``service-hostname`` in the ``SRV`` record. You can ignore these records.
             
            * If you're using a system that requires a specific ``SRV`` format, such as HAProxy, see the `Name <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/api/API_CreateService.html#cloudmap-CreateService-request-Name>`__ element in the documentation about ``CreateService`` for information about how to specify the correct name format.
            

            

          
          - **TTL** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The amount of time, in seconds, that you want DNS resolvers to cache the settings for this record.

             

            .. note::

              

              Alias records don't include a TTL because Route 53 uses the TTL for the Amazon Web Services resource that an alias record routes traffic to. If you include the ``AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME`` attribute when you submit a `RegisterInstance <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/api/API_RegisterInstance.html>`__ request, the ``TTL`` value is ignored. Always specify a TTL for the service; you can use a service to register instances that create either alias or non-alias records.

              

            

          
        
    
    
    - **HealthCheckConfig** *(dict) --* 

      *Public DNS and HTTP namespaces only.* Settings for an optional health check. If you specify settings for a health check, Cloud Map associates the health check with the records that you specify in ``DnsConfig``.

      

    
      - **Type** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The type of health check that you want to create, which indicates how Route 53 determines whether an endpoint is healthy.

         

        .. warning::

           

          You can't change the value of ``Type`` after you create a health check.

           

         

        You can create the following types of health checks:

         

        
        * **HTTP**: Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53 submits an HTTP request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.
         
        * **HTTPS**: Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53 submits an HTTPS request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400. 

        .. warning::

          If you specify HTTPS for the value of ``Type``, the endpoint must support TLS v1.0 or later.

        
         
        * **TCP**: Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If you specify ``TCP`` for ``Type``, don't specify a value for ``ResourcePath``.
        

         

        For more information, see `How Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__ in the *Route 53 Developer Guide*.

        

      
      - **ResourcePath** *(string) --* 

        The path that you want Route 53 to request when performing health checks. The path can be any value that your endpoint returns an HTTP status code of a 2xx or 3xx format for when the endpoint is healthy. An example file is ``/docs/route53-health-check.html``. Route 53 automatically adds the DNS name for the service. If you don't specify a value for ``ResourcePath``, the default value is ``/``.

         

        If you specify ``TCP`` for ``Type``, you must *not* specify a value for ``ResourcePath``.

        

      
      - **FailureThreshold** *(integer) --* 

        The number of consecutive health checks that an endpoint must pass or fail for Route 53 to change the current status of the endpoint from unhealthy to healthy or the other way around. For more information, see `How Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__ in the *Route 53 Developer Guide*.
