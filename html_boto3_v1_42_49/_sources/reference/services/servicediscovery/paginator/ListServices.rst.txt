    :type Filters: list
    :param Filters: 

      A complex type that contains specifications for the namespaces that you want to list services for.

       

      If you specify more than one filter, an operation must match all filters to be returned by ``ListServices``.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        A complex type that lets you specify the namespaces that you want to list services for.

        

      
        - **Name** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          Specify the services that you want to get using one of the following.

           

          
          * ``NAMESPACE_ID``: Gets the services associated with the specified namespace.
           
          * ``RESOURCE_OWNER``: Gets the services associated with the namespaces created by your Amazon Web Services account or by other accounts. This can be used to filter for services created in a shared namespace. For more information about shared namespaces, see `Cross-account Cloud Map namespace sharing <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/dg/sharing-namespaces.html>`__ in the *Cloud Map Developer Guide*.
          

          

        
        - **Values** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The values that are applicable to the value that you specify for ``Condition`` to filter the list of services.

           

          
          * **NAMESPACE_ID**: Specify one namespace ID or ARN. Specify the namespace ARN for namespaces that are shared with your Amazon Web Services account.
           
          * **RESOURCE_OWNER**: Specify one of ``SELF`` or ``OTHER_ACCOUNTS``. ``SELF`` can be used to filter services associated with namespaces created by you and ``OTHER_ACCOUNTS`` can be used to filter services associated with namespaces that were shared with you.

            - **ResourceOwner** *(string) --* 

              The ID of the Amazon Web Services account that created the namespace with which the service is associated. If this isn't your account ID, it is the ID of the account that shared the namespace with your account. For more information about shared namespaces, see `Cross-account Cloud Map namespace sharing <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/dg/sharing-namespaces.html>`__ in the *Cloud Map Developer Guide*.

              
            

            - **Name** *(string) --* 

              The name of the service.

              
            

            - **Type** *(string) --*

                DNS_HTTP  

              The service instances can be discovered using either DNS queries or the ``DiscoverInstances`` API operation.

                HTTP  

              The service instances can only be discovered using the ``DiscoverInstances`` API operation.

                DNS  

              Reserved.

              
            

            - **Description** *(string) --* 

              The description that you specify when you create the service.

              
            

            - **InstanceCount** *(integer) --* 

              The number of instances that are currently associated with the service. Instances that were previously associated with the service but that are deleted aren't included in the count. The count might not reflect pending registrations and deregistrations.

              
            

            - **DnsConfig** *(dict) --* 

              Information about the Route 53 DNS records that you want Cloud Map to create when you register an instance.

              
              

              - **NamespaceId** *(string) --* 

                Use NamespaceId in `Service <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/api/API_Service.html>`__ instead.

                 

                The ID of the namespace to use for DNS configuration.

                
              

              - **RoutingPolicy** *(string) --* 

                The routing policy that you want to apply to all Route 53 DNS records that Cloud Map creates when you register an instance and specify this service.

                 

                .. note::

                  

                  If you want to use this service to register instances that create alias records, specify ``WEIGHTED`` for the routing policy.

                  

                 

                You can specify the following values:

                  MULTIVALUE  

                If you define a health check for the service and the health check is healthy, Route 53 returns the applicable value for up to eight instances.

                 

                For example, suppose that the service includes configurations for one ``A`` record and a health check. You use the service to register 10 instances. Route 53 responds to DNS queries with IP addresses for up to eight healthy instances. If fewer than eight instances are healthy, Route 53 responds to every DNS query with the IP addresses for all of the healthy instances.

                 

                If you don't define a health check for the service, Route 53 assumes that all instances are healthy and returns the values for up to eight instances.

                 

                For more information about the multivalue routing policy, see `Multivalue Answer Routing <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html#routing-policy-multivalue>`__ in the *Route 53 Developer Guide*.

                  WEIGHTED  

                Route 53 returns the applicable value from one randomly selected instance from among the instances that you registered using the same service. Currently, all records have the same weight, so you can't route more or less traffic to any instances.

                 

                For example, suppose that the service includes configurations for one ``A`` record and a health check. You use the service to register 10 instances. Route 53 responds to DNS queries with the IP address for one randomly selected instance from among the healthy instances. If no instances are healthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries as if all of the instances were healthy.

                 

                If you don't define a health check for the service, Route 53 assumes that all instances are healthy and returns the applicable value for one randomly selected instance.

                 

                For more information about the weighted routing policy, see `Weighted Routing <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html#routing-policy-weighted>`__ in the *Route 53 Developer Guide*.

                
              

              - **DnsRecords** *(list) --* 

                An array that contains one ``DnsRecord`` object for each Route 53 DNS record that you want Cloud Map to create when you register an instance.

                 

                .. warning::

                   

                  The record type of a service specified in a ``DnsRecord`` object can't be updated. To change a record type, you need to delete the service and recreate it with a new ``DnsConfig``.

                  

                
                

                - *(dict) --* 

                  A complex type that contains information about the Route 53 DNS records that you want Cloud Map to create when you register an instance.

                  
                  

                  - **Type** *(string) --* 

                    The type of the resource, which indicates the type of value that Route 53 returns in response to DNS queries. You can specify values for ``Type`` in the following combinations:

                     

                    
                    * ``A``
                     
                    * ``AAAA``
                     
                    * ``A`` and ``AAAA``
                     
                    * ``SRV``
                     
                    * ``CNAME``
                    

                     

                    If you want Cloud Map to create a Route 53 alias record when you register an instance, specify ``A`` or ``AAAA`` for ``Type``.

                     

                    You specify other settings, such as the IP address for ``A`` and ``AAAA`` records, when you register an instance. For more information, see `RegisterInstance <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/api/API_RegisterInstance.html>`__.

                     

                    The following values are supported:

                      A  

                    Route 53 returns the IP address of the resource in IPv4 format, such as 192.0.2.44.

                      AAAA  

                    Route 53 returns the IP address of the resource in IPv6 format, such as 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345.

                      CNAME  

                    Route 53 returns the domain name of the resource, such as www.example.com. Note the following:

                     

                    
                    * You specify the domain name that you want to route traffic to when you register an instance. For more information, see `Attributes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/api/API_RegisterInstance.html#cloudmap-RegisterInstance-request-Attributes>`__ in the topic `RegisterInstance <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/api/API_RegisterInstance.html>`__.
                     
                    * You must specify ``WEIGHTED`` for the value of ``RoutingPolicy``.
                     
                    * You can't specify both ``CNAME`` for ``Type`` and settings for ``HealthCheckConfig``. If you do, the request will fail with an ``InvalidInput`` error.
                    

                      SRV  

                    Route 53 returns the value for an ``SRV`` record. The value for an ``SRV`` record uses the following values:

                     

                    ``priority weight port service-hostname``

                     

                    Note the following about the values:

                     

                    
                    * The values of ``priority`` and ``weight`` are both set to ``1`` and can't be changed.
                     
                    * The value of ``port`` comes from the value that you specify for the ``AWS_INSTANCE_PORT`` attribute when you submit a `RegisterInstance <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/api/API_RegisterInstance.html>`__ request.
                     
                    * The value of ``service-hostname`` is a concatenation of the following values: 

                      
                      * The value that you specify for ``InstanceId`` when you register an instance.
                       
                      * The name of the service.
                       
                      * The name of the namespace.
                      

                     

                    For example, if the value of ``InstanceId`` is ``test``, the name of the service is ``backend``, and the name of the namespace is ``example.com``, the value of ``service-hostname`` is the following:

                     

                    ``test.backend.example.com``

                    
                    

                     

                    If you specify settings for an ``SRV`` record, note the following:

                     

                    
                    * If you specify values for ``AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4``, ``AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6``, or both in the ``RegisterInstance`` request, Cloud Map automatically creates ``A`` and/or ``AAAA`` records that have the same name as the value of ``service-hostname`` in the ``SRV`` record. You can ignore these records.
                     
                    * If you're using a system that requires a specific ``SRV`` format, such as HAProxy, see the `Name <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/api/API_CreateService.html#cloudmap-CreateService-request-Name>`__ element in the documentation about ``CreateService`` for information about how to specify the correct name format.
                    

                    
                  

                  - **TTL** *(integer) --* 

                    The amount of time, in seconds, that you want DNS resolvers to cache the settings for this record.

                     

                    .. note::

                      

                      Alias records don't include a TTL because Route 53 uses the TTL for the Amazon Web Services resource that an alias record routes traffic to. If you include the ``AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME`` attribute when you submit a `RegisterInstance <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/api/API_RegisterInstance.html>`__ request, the ``TTL`` value is ignored. Always specify a TTL for the service; you can use a service to register instances that create either alias or non-alias records.

                      

                    
              
            
          
            

            - **HealthCheckConfig** *(dict) --* 

              *Public DNS and HTTP namespaces only.* Settings for an optional health check. If you specify settings for a health check, Cloud Map associates the health check with the records that you specify in ``DnsConfig``.

              
              

              - **Type** *(string) --* 

                The type of health check that you want to create, which indicates how Route 53 determines whether an endpoint is healthy.

                  You can't change the value of ``Type`` after you create a health check.

                   

                 

                You can create the following types of health checks:

                 

                
                * **HTTP**: Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53 submits an HTTP request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.
                 
                * **HTTPS**: Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53 submits an HTTPS request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400. 

                .. warning::

                  If you specify HTTPS for the value of ``Type``, the endpoint must support TLS v1.0 or later.

                
                 
                * **TCP**: Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If you specify ``TCP`` for ``Type``, don't specify a value for ``ResourcePath``.
                

                 

                For more information, see `How Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__ in the *Route 53 Developer Guide*.

                
              

              - **ResourcePath** *(string) --* 

                The path that you want Route 53 to request when performing health checks. The path can be any value that your endpoint returns an HTTP status code of a 2xx or 3xx format for when the endpoint is healthy. An example file is ``/docs/route53-health-check.html``. Route 53 automatically adds the DNS name for the service. If you don't specify a value for ``ResourcePath``, the default value is ``/``.

                 

                If you specify ``TCP`` for ``Type``, you must *not* specify a value for ``ResourcePath``.

                
              

              - **FailureThreshold** *(integer) --* 

                The number of consecutive health checks that an endpoint must pass or fail for Route 53 to change the current status of the endpoint from unhealthy to healthy or the other way around. For more information, see `How Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html>`__ in the *Route 53 Developer Guide*.

                
          
            

            - **HealthCheckCustomConfig** *(dict) --* 

              Information about an optional custom health check. A custom health check, which requires that you use a third-party health checker to evaluate the health of your resources, is useful in the following circumstances:

               

              
              * You can't use a health check that's defined by ``HealthCheckConfig`` because the resource isn't available over the internet. For example, you can use a custom health check when the instance is in an Amazon VPC. (To check the health of resources in a VPC, the health checker must also be in the VPC.)
               
              * You want to use a third-party health checker regardless of where your resources are located.
              

               

              .. warning::

                 

                If you specify a health check configuration, you can specify either ``HealthCheckCustomConfig`` or ``HealthCheckConfig`` but not both.

                

              
              

              - **FailureThreshold** *(integer) --* 

                .. warning::

                  

                  This parameter is no longer supported and is always set to 1. Cloud Map waits for approximately 30 seconds after receiving an ``UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus`` request before changing the status of the service instance.

                   

                 

                The number of 30-second intervals that you want Cloud Map to wait after receiving an ``UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus`` request before it changes the health status of a service instance.

                 

                Sending a second or subsequent ``UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus`` request with the same value before 30 seconds has passed doesn't accelerate the change. Cloud Map still waits ``30`` seconds after the first request to make the change.

                
          
            

            - **CreateDate** *(datetime) --* 

              The date and time that the service was created.

              
            

            - **CreatedByAccount** *(string) --* 

              The ID of the Amazon Web Services account that created the service. If this isn't your account ID, it is the account ID of the namespace owner or of another account with which the namespace has been shared. For more information about shared namespaces, see `Cross-account Cloud Map namespace sharing <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/dg/sharing-namespaces.html>`__ in the *Cloud Map Developer Guide*.
