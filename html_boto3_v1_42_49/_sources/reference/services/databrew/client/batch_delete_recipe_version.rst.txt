.. py:method:: GlueDataBrew.Client.batch_delete_recipe_version(**kwargs)

  

  Deletes one or more versions of a recipe at a time.

   

  The entire request will be rejected if:

   

  
  * The recipe does not exist.
   
  * There is an invalid version identifier in the list of versions.
   
  * The version list is empty.
   
  * The version list size exceeds 50.
   
  * The version list contains duplicate entries.
  

   

  The request will complete successfully, but with partial failures, if:

   

  
  * A version does not exist.
   
  * A version is being used by a job.
   
  * You specify ``LATEST_WORKING``, but it's being used by a project.
   
  * The version fails to be deleted.
  

   

  The ``LATEST_WORKING`` version will only be deleted if the recipe has no other versions. If you try to delete ``LATEST_WORKING`` while other versions exist (or if they can't be deleted), then ``LATEST_WORKING`` will be listed as partial failure in the response.
