    **If you will no longer be using a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) as the registration code for your WorkSpaces users, you must take certain precautions to prevent potential security issues.** For more information, see `Security Considerations if You Stop Using Cross-Region Redirection <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/cross-region-redirection.html#cross-region-redirection-security-considerations>`__.

     

   

  .. note::

    

    To delete a connection alias that has been shared, the shared account must first disassociate the connection alias from any directories it has been associated with. Then you must unshare the connection alias from the account it has been shared with. You can delete a connection alias only after it is no longer shared with any accounts or associated with any directories.
