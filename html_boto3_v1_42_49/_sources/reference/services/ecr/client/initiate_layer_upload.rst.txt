.. py:method:: ECR.Client.initiate_layer_upload(**kwargs)

  

  Notifies Amazon ECR that you intend to upload an image layer.

   

  When an image is pushed, the InitiateLayerUpload API is called once per image layer that has not already been uploaded. Whether or not an image layer has been uploaded is determined by the BatchCheckLayerAvailability API action.

   

  .. note::

    

    This operation is used by the Amazon ECR proxy and is not generally used by customers for pulling and pushing images. In most cases, you should use the ``docker`` CLI to pull, tag, and push images.
