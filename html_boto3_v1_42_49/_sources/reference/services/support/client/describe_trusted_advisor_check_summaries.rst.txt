    * You must have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support plan to use the Amazon Web Services Support API.
     
    * If you call the Amazon Web Services Support API from an account that doesn't have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support plan, the ``SubscriptionRequiredException`` error message appears. For information about changing your support plan, see `Amazon Web Services Support <http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/>`__.
    

    

   

  To call the Trusted Advisor operations in the Amazon Web Services Support API, you must use the US East (N. Virginia) endpoint. Currently, the US West (Oregon) and Europe (Ireland) endpoints don't support the Trusted Advisor operations. For more information, see `About the Amazon Web Services Support API <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/about-support-api.html#endpoint>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services Support User Guide*.
