.. py:method:: Support.Client.describe_services(**kwargs)

  

  Returns the current list of Amazon Web Services services and a list of service categories for each service. You then use service names and categories in your  CreateCase requests. Each Amazon Web Services service has its own set of categories.

   

  The service codes and category codes correspond to the values that appear in the **Service** and **Category** lists on the Amazon Web Services Support Center `Create Case <https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create>`__ page. The values in those fields don't necessarily match the service codes and categories returned by the ``DescribeServices`` operation. Always use the service codes and categories that the ``DescribeServices`` operation returns, so that you have the most recent set of service and category codes.

   

  .. note::

    

    
    * You must have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support plan to use the Amazon Web Services Support API.
     
    * If you call the Amazon Web Services Support API from an account that doesn't have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support plan, the ``SubscriptionRequiredException`` error message appears. For information about changing your support plan, see `Amazon Web Services Support <http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/>`__.
