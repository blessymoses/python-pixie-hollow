.. py:method:: Support.Client.create_case(**kwargs)

  

  Creates a case in the Amazon Web Services Support Center. This operation is similar to how you create a case in the Amazon Web Services Support Center `Create Case <https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create>`__ page.

   

  The Amazon Web Services Support API doesn't support requesting service limit increases. You can submit a service limit increase in the following ways:

   

  
  * Submit a request from the Amazon Web Services Support Center `Create Case <https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create>`__ page.
   
  * Use the Service Quotas `RequestServiceQuotaIncrease <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/2019-06-24/apireference/API_RequestServiceQuotaIncrease.html>`__ operation.
  

   

  A successful ``CreateCase`` request returns an Amazon Web Services Support case number. You can use the  DescribeCases operation and specify the case number to get existing Amazon Web Services Support cases. After you create a case, use the  AddCommunicationToCase operation to add additional communication or attachments to an existing case.

   

  The ``caseId`` is separate from the ``displayId`` that appears in the `Amazon Web Services Support Center <https://console.aws.amazon.com/support>`__. Use the  DescribeCases operation to get the ``displayId``.

   

  .. note::

    

    
    * You must have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support plan to use the Amazon Web Services Support API.
     
    * If you call the Amazon Web Services Support API from an account that doesn't have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support plan, the ``SubscriptionRequiredException`` error message appears. For information about changing your support plan, see `Amazon Web Services Support <http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/>`__.

        attachmentSetId='string'
    )
    
  :type subject: string
  :param subject: **[REQUIRED]**

  :type severityCode: string
  :param severityCode: 

    A value that indicates the urgency of the case. This value determines the response time according to your service level agreement with Amazon Web Services Support. You can use the  DescribeSeverityLevels operation to get the possible values for ``severityCode``.

     

    For more information, see  SeverityLevel and `Choosing a Severity <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/getting-started.html#choosing-severity>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services Support User Guide*.

     

    .. note::

      

      The availability of severity levels depends on the support plan for the Amazon Web Services account.

      

    

  
  :type categoryCode: string
  :param categoryCode:
