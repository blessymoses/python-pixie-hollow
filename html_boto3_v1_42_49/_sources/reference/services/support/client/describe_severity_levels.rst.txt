.. py:method:: Support.Client.describe_severity_levels(**kwargs)

  

  Returns the list of severity levels that you can assign to a support case. The severity level for a case is also a field in the  CaseDetails data type that you include for a  CreateCase request.

   

  .. note::

    

    
    * You must have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support plan to use the Amazon Web Services Support API.
     
    * If you call the Amazon Web Services Support API from an account that doesn't have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support plan, the ``SubscriptionRequiredException`` error message appears. For information about changing your support plan, see `Amazon Web Services Support <http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/>`__.

    ::

      {
          'severityLevels': [
              {
                  'code': 'string',

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 

      The list of severity levels returned by the  DescribeSeverityLevels operation.

      
      

      - **severityLevels** *(list) --* 

        The available severity levels for the support case. Available severity levels are defined by your service level agreement with Amazon Web Services.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          A code and name pair that represents the severity level of a support case. The available values depend on the support plan for the account. For more information, see `Choosing a severity <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/case-management.html#choosing-severity>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services Support User Guide*.

          
          

          - **code** *(string) --* 

            The code for case severity level.

             

            Valid values: ``low`` | ``normal`` | ``high`` | ``urgent`` | ``critical``

            
          

          - **name** *(string) --* 

            The name of the severity level that corresponds to the severity level code.

             

            .. note::

              

              The values returned by the API are different from the values that appear in the Amazon Web Services Support Center. For example, the API uses the code ``low``, but the name appears as General guidance in Support Center.

               

              The following are the API code names and how they appear in the console:

               

              
              * ``low`` - General guidance
               
              * ``normal`` - System impaired
               
              * ``high`` - Production system impaired
               
              * ``urgent`` - Production system down
               
              * ``critical`` - Business-critical system down
