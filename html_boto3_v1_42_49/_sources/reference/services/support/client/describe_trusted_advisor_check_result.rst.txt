.. py:method:: Support.Client.describe_trusted_advisor_check_result(**kwargs)

  

  Returns the results of the Trusted Advisor check that has the specified check ID. You can get the check IDs by calling the  DescribeTrustedAdvisorChecks operation.

   

  The response contains a  TrustedAdvisorCheckResult object, which contains these three objects:

   

  
  *  TrustedAdvisorCategorySpecificSummary
   
  *  TrustedAdvisorResourceDetail
   
  *  TrustedAdvisorResourcesSummary
  

   

  In addition, the response contains these fields:

   

  
  * **status** - The alert status of the check can be ``ok`` (green), ``warning`` (yellow), ``error`` (red), or ``not_available``.
   
  * **timestamp** - The time of the last refresh of the check.
   
  * **checkId** - The unique identifier for the check.
  

   

  .. note::

    

    
    * You must have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support plan to use the Amazon Web Services Support API.
     
    * If you call the Amazon Web Services Support API from an account that doesn't have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support plan, the ``SubscriptionRequiredException`` error message appears. For information about changing your support plan, see `Amazon Web Services Support <http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/>`__.
    

    

   

  To call the Trusted Advisor operations in the Amazon Web Services Support API, you must use the US East (N. Virginia) endpoint. Currently, the US West (Oregon) and Europe (Ireland) endpoints don't support the Trusted Advisor operations. For more information, see `About the Amazon Web Services Support API <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/about-support-api.html#endpoint>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services Support User Guide*.
