.. py:method:: Support.Client.describe_cases(**kwargs)

  

  Returns a list of cases that you specify by passing one or more case IDs. You can use the ``afterTime`` and ``beforeTime`` parameters to filter the cases by date. You can set values for the ``includeResolvedCases`` and ``includeCommunications`` parameters to specify how much information to return.

   

  The response returns the following in JSON format:

   

  
  * One or more `CaseDetails <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/APIReference/API_CaseDetails.html>`__ data types.
   
  * One or more ``nextToken`` values, which specify where to paginate the returned records represented by the ``CaseDetails`` objects.
  

   

  Case data is available for 12 months after creation. If a case was created more than 12 months ago, a request might return an error.

   

  .. note::

    

    
    * You must have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support plan to use the Amazon Web Services Support API.
     
    * If you call the Amazon Web Services Support API from an account that doesn't have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support plan, the ``SubscriptionRequiredException`` error message appears. For information about changing your support plan, see `Amazon Web Services Support <http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/>`__.
