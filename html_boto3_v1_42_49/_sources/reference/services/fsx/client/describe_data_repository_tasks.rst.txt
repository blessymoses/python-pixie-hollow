.. py:method:: FSx.Client.describe_data_repository_tasks(**kwargs)

  

  Returns the description of specific Amazon FSx for Lustre or Amazon File Cache data repository tasks, if one or more ``TaskIds`` values are provided in the request, or if filters are used in the request. You can use filters to narrow the response to include just tasks for specific file systems or caches, or tasks in a specific lifecycle state. Otherwise, it returns all data repository tasks owned by your Amazon Web Services account in the Amazon Web Services Region of the endpoint that you're calling.

   

  When retrieving all tasks, you can paginate the response by using the optional ``MaxResults`` parameter to limit the number of tasks returned in a response. If more tasks remain, a ``NextToken`` value is returned in the response. In this case, send a later request with the ``NextToken`` request parameter set to the value of ``NextToken`` from the last response.

          - **Report** *(dict) --* 

            Provides a report detailing the data repository task results of the files processed that match the criteria specified in the report ``Scope`` parameter. FSx delivers the report to the file system's linked data repository in Amazon S3, using the path specified in the report ``Path`` parameter. You can specify whether or not a report gets generated for a task using the ``Enabled`` parameter.

            
            

            - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

              Set ``Enabled`` to ``True`` to generate a ``CompletionReport`` when the task completes. If set to ``true``, then you need to provide a report ``Scope``, ``Path``, and ``Format``. Set ``Enabled`` to ``False`` if you do not want a ``CompletionReport`` generated when the task completes.

              
            

            - **Path** *(string) --* 

              Required if ``Enabled`` is set to ``true``. Specifies the location of the report on the file system's linked S3 data repository. An absolute path that defines where the completion report will be stored in the destination location. The ``Path`` you provide must be located within the file system’s ExportPath. An example ``Path`` value is "s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/myExportPath/optionalPrefix". The report provides the following information for each file in the report: FilePath, FileStatus, and ErrorCode.

              
            

            - **Format** *(string) --* 

              Required if ``Enabled`` is set to ``true``. Specifies the format of the ``CompletionReport``. ``REPORT_CSV_20191124`` is the only format currently supported. When ``Format`` is set to ``REPORT_CSV_20191124``, the ``CompletionReport`` is provided in CSV format, and is delivered to ``{path}/task-{id}/failures.csv``.

              
            

            - **Scope** *(string) --* 

              Required if ``Enabled`` is set to ``true``. Specifies the scope of the ``CompletionReport``; ``FAILED_FILES_ONLY`` is the only scope currently supported. When ``Scope`` is set to ``FAILED_FILES_ONLY``, the ``CompletionReport`` only contains information about files that the data repository task failed to process.

              
        
          

          - **CapacityToRelease** *(integer) --* 

            Specifies the amount of data to release, in GiB, by an Amazon File Cache AUTO_RELEASE_DATA task that automatically releases files from the cache.

            The system-generated, unique ID of the cache.

            
          

          - **ReleaseConfiguration** *(dict) --* 

            The configuration that specifies the last accessed time criteria for files that will be released from an Amazon FSx for Lustre file system.

            
            

            - **DurationSinceLastAccess** *(dict) --* 

              Defines the point-in-time since an exported file was last accessed, in order for that file to be eligible for release. Only files that were last accessed before this point-in-time are eligible to be released from the file system.

              
              

              - **Unit** *(string) --* 

                The unit of time used by the ``Value`` parameter to determine if a file can be released, based on when it was last accessed. ``DAYS`` is the only supported value. This is a required parameter.

                
              

              - **Value** *(integer) --* 

                An integer that represents the minimum amount of time (in days) since a file was last accessed in the file system. Only exported files with a ``MAX(atime, ctime, mtime)`` timestamp that is more than this amount of time in the past (relative to the task create time) will be released. The default of ``Value`` is ``0``. This is a required parameter.

                 

                .. note::

                  

                  If an exported file meets the last accessed time criteria, its file or directory path must also be specified in the ``Paths`` parameter of the operation in order for the file to be released.

                  

                
          
        
      
    
      

      - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

        (Optional) Opaque pagination token returned from a previous operation (String). If present, this token indicates from what point you can continue processing the request, where the previous ``NextToken`` value left off.
