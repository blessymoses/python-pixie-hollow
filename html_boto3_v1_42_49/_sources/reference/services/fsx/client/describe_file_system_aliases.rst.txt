  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.describe_file_system_aliases(
        ClientRequestToken='string',
        FileSystemId='string',
        MaxResults=123,
        NextToken='string'
    )
    
  :type ClientRequestToken: string
  :param ClientRequestToken: 

    (Optional) An idempotency token for resource creation, in a string of up to 63 ASCII characters. This token is automatically filled on your behalf when you use the Command Line Interface (CLI) or an Amazon Web Services SDK.

    This field is autopopulated if not provided.

  
  :type FileSystemId: string
  :param FileSystemId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ID of the file system to return the associated DNS aliases for (String).

    

  
  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    Maximum number of DNS aliases to return in the response (integer). This parameter value must be greater than 0. The number of items that Amazon FSx returns is the minimum of the ``MaxResults`` parameter specified in the request and the service's internal maximum number of items per page.

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    Opaque pagination token returned from a previous ``DescribeFileSystemAliases`` operation (String). If a token is included in the request, the action continues the list from where the previous returning call left off.

    **Response Syntax**

    
    ::

      {
          'Aliases': [
              {
                  'Name': 'string',
                  'Lifecycle': 'AVAILABLE'|'CREATING'|'DELETING'|'CREATE_FAILED'|'DELETE_FAILED'

      }
      
    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 

      The response object for ``DescribeFileSystemAliases`` operation.

      
      

      - **Aliases** *(list) --* 

        An array of one or more DNS aliases currently associated with the specified file system.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          A DNS alias that is associated with the file system. You can use a DNS alias to access a file system using user-defined DNS names, in addition to the default DNS name that Amazon FSx assigns to the file system. For more information, see `DNS aliases <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/managing-dns-aliases.html>`__ in the *FSx for Windows File Server User Guide*.

          
          

          - **Name** *(string) --* 

            The name of the DNS alias. The alias name has to meet the following requirements:

             

            
            * Formatted as a fully-qualified domain name (FQDN), ``hostname.domain``, for example, ``accounting.example.com``.
             
            * Can contain alphanumeric characters, the underscore (_), and the hyphen (-).
             
            * Cannot start or end with a hyphen.
             
            * Can start with a numeric.
            

             

            For DNS names, Amazon FSx stores alphabetic characters as lowercase letters (a-z), regardless of how you specify them: as uppercase letters, lowercase letters, or the corresponding letters in escape codes.

            
          

          - **Lifecycle** *(string) --* 

            Describes the state of the DNS alias.

             

            
            * AVAILABLE - The DNS alias is associated with an Amazon FSx file system.
             
            * CREATING - Amazon FSx is creating the DNS alias and associating it with the file system.
             
            * CREATE_FAILED - Amazon FSx was unable to associate the DNS alias with the file system.
             
            * DELETING - Amazon FSx is disassociating the DNS alias from the file system and deleting it.
             
            * DELETE_FAILED - Amazon FSx was unable to disassociate the DNS alias from the file system.
            

            
      
    
      

      - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

        Present if there are more DNS aliases than returned in the response (String). You can use the ``NextToken`` value in a later request to fetch additional descriptions.
