.. py:method:: FSx.Client.delete_file_system(**kwargs)

  

  Deletes a file system. After deletion, the file system no longer exists, and its data is gone. Any existing automatic backups and snapshots are also deleted.

   

  To delete an Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file system, first delete all the volumes and storage virtual machines (SVMs) on the file system. Then provide a ``FileSystemId`` value to the ``DeleteFileSystem`` operation.

   

  Before deleting an Amazon FSx for OpenZFS file system, make sure that there aren't any Amazon S3 access points attached to any volume. For more information on how to list S3 access points that are attached to volumes, see `Listing S3 access point attachments <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/OpenZFSGuide/access-points-list.html>`__. For more information on how to delete S3 access points, see `Deleting an S3 access point attachment <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/OpenZFSGuide/delete-access-point.html>`__.

   

  By default, when you delete an Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file system, a final backup is created upon deletion. This final backup isn't subject to the file system's retention policy, and must be manually deleted.

   

  To delete an Amazon FSx for Lustre file system, first `unmount <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/unmounting-fs.html>`__ it from every connected Amazon EC2 instance, then provide a ``FileSystemId`` value to the ``DeleteFileSystem`` operation. By default, Amazon FSx will not take a final backup when the ``DeleteFileSystem`` operation is invoked. On file systems not linked to an Amazon S3 bucket, set ``SkipFinalBackup`` to ``false`` to take a final backup of the file system you are deleting. Backups cannot be enabled on S3-linked file systems. To ensure all of your data is written back to S3 before deleting your file system, you can either monitor for the `AgeOfOldestQueuedMessage <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/monitoring-cloudwatch.html#auto-import-export-metrics>`__ metric to be zero (if using automatic export) or you can run an `export data repository task <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/export-data-repo-task-dra.html>`__. If you have automatic export enabled and want to use an export data repository task, you have to disable automatic export before executing the export data repository task.

   

  The ``DeleteFileSystem`` operation returns while the file system has the ``DELETING`` status. You can check the file system deletion status by calling the `DescribeFileSystems <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeFileSystems.html>`__ operation, which returns a list of file systems in your account. If you pass the file system ID for a deleted file system, the ``DescribeFileSystems`` operation returns a ``FileSystemNotFound`` error.

   

  .. note::

    

    If a data repository task is in a ``PENDING`` or ``EXECUTING`` state, deleting an Amazon FSx for Lustre file system will fail with an HTTP status code 400 (Bad Request).

    

   

  .. warning::

     

    The data in a deleted file system is also deleted and can't be recovered by any means.

  :type FileSystemId: string
  :param FileSystemId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ID of the file system that you want to delete.

    

  
  :type ClientRequestToken: string
  :param ClientRequestToken: 

    A string of up to 63 ASCII characters that Amazon FSx uses to ensure idempotent deletion. This token is automatically filled on your behalf when using the Command Line Interface (CLI) or an Amazon Web Services SDK.

    This field is autopopulated if not provided.

  
  :type WindowsConfiguration: dict
  :param WindowsConfiguration: 

    The configuration object for the Microsoft Windows file system used in the ``DeleteFileSystem`` operation.

    

  
    - **SkipFinalBackup** *(boolean) --* 

      By default, Amazon FSx for Windows takes a final backup on your behalf when the ``DeleteFileSystem`` operation is invoked. Doing this helps protect you from data loss, and we highly recommend taking the final backup. If you want to skip this backup, use this flag to do so.

      

    
    - **FinalBackupTags** *(list) --* 

      A set of tags for your final backup.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        Specifies a key-value pair for a resource tag.

        

      
        - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          A value that specifies the ``TagKey``, the name of the tag. Tag keys must be unique for the resource to which they are attached.

          

        
        - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          A value that specifies the ``TagValue``, the value assigned to the corresponding tag key. Tag values can be null and don't have to be unique in a tag set. For example, you can have a key-value pair in a tag set of ``finances : April`` and also of ``payroll : April``.

          

        
      
  
  
  :type LustreConfiguration: dict
  :param LustreConfiguration: 

    The configuration object for the Amazon FSx for Lustre file system being deleted in the ``DeleteFileSystem`` operation.

    

  
    - **SkipFinalBackup** *(boolean) --* 

      Set ``SkipFinalBackup`` to false if you want to take a final backup of the file system you are deleting. By default, Amazon FSx will not take a final backup on your behalf when the ``DeleteFileSystem`` operation is invoked. (Default = true)

       

      .. note::

        

        The ``fsx:CreateBackup`` permission is required if you set ``SkipFinalBackup`` to ``false`` in order to delete the file system and take a final backup.

        

      

    
    - **FinalBackupTags** *(list) --* 

      Use if ``SkipFinalBackup`` is set to ``false``, and you want to apply an array of tags to the final backup. If you have set the file system property ``CopyTagsToBackups`` to true, and you specify one or more ``FinalBackupTags`` when deleting a file system, Amazon FSx will not copy any existing file system tags to the backup.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        Specifies a key-value pair for a resource tag.

        

      
        - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          A value that specifies the ``TagKey``, the name of the tag. Tag keys must be unique for the resource to which they are attached.

          

        
        - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          A value that specifies the ``TagValue``, the value assigned to the corresponding tag key. Tag values can be null and don't have to be unique in a tag set. For example, you can have a key-value pair in a tag set of ``finances : April`` and also of ``payroll : April``.

          

        
      
  
  
  :type OpenZFSConfiguration: dict
  :param OpenZFSConfiguration: 

    The configuration object for the OpenZFS file system used in the ``DeleteFileSystem`` operation.

    

  
    - **SkipFinalBackup** *(boolean) --* 

      By default, Amazon FSx for OpenZFS takes a final backup on your behalf when the ``DeleteFileSystem`` operation is invoked. Doing this helps protect you from data loss, and we highly recommend taking the final backup. If you want to skip taking a final backup, set this value to ``true``.

      

    
    - **FinalBackupTags** *(list) --* 

      A list of tags to apply to the file system's final backup.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        Specifies a key-value pair for a resource tag.

        

      
        - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          A value that specifies the ``TagKey``, the name of the tag. Tag keys must be unique for the resource to which they are attached.

          

        
        - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

For example, you can have a key-value pair in a tag set of ``finances : April`` and also of ``payroll : April``.

          

        
      
  
    - **Options** *(list) --* 

      To delete a file system if there are child volumes present below the root volume, use the string ``DELETE_CHILD_VOLUMES_AND_SNAPSHOTS``. If your file system has child volumes and you don't use this option, the delete request will fail.
