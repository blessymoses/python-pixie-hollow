.. py:method:: FSx.Client.disassociate_file_system_aliases(**kwargs)

  

  Use this action to disassociate, or remove, one or more Domain Name Service (DNS) aliases from an Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file system. If you attempt to disassociate a DNS alias that is not associated with the file system, Amazon FSx responds with an HTTP status code 400 (Bad Request). For more information, see `Working with DNS Aliases <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/managing-dns-aliases.html>`__.

   

  The system generated response showing the DNS aliases that Amazon FSx is attempting to disassociate from the file system. Use the API operation to monitor the status of the aliases Amazon FSx is disassociating with the file system.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 

      The system generated response showing the DNS aliases that Amazon FSx is attempting to disassociate from the file system. Use the API operation to monitor the status of the aliases Amazon FSx is removing from the file system.

      
      

      - **Aliases** *(list) --* 

        An array of one or more DNS aliases that Amazon FSx is attempting to disassociate from the file system.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          A DNS alias that is associated with the file system. You can use a DNS alias to access a file system using user-defined DNS names, in addition to the default DNS name that Amazon FSx assigns to the file system. For more information, see `DNS aliases <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/managing-dns-aliases.html>`__ in the *FSx for Windows File Server User Guide*.

          
          

          - **Name** *(string) --* 

            The name of the DNS alias. The alias name has to meet the following requirements:

             

            
            * Formatted as a fully-qualified domain name (FQDN), ``hostname.domain``, for example, ``accounting.example.com``.
             
            * Can contain alphanumeric characters, the underscore (_), and the hyphen (-).
             
            * Cannot start or end with a hyphen.
             
            * Can start with a numeric.
            

             

            For DNS names, Amazon FSx stores alphabetic characters as lowercase letters (a-z), regardless of how you specify them: as uppercase letters, lowercase letters, or the corresponding letters in escape codes.

            
          

          - **Lifecycle** *(string) --* 

            Describes the state of the DNS alias.

             

            
            * AVAILABLE - The DNS alias is associated with an Amazon FSx file system.
             
            * CREATING - Amazon FSx is creating the DNS alias and associating it with the file system.
             
            * CREATE_FAILED - Amazon FSx was unable to associate the DNS alias with the file system.
             
            * DELETING - Amazon FSx is disassociating the DNS alias from the file system and deleting it.
             
            * DELETE_FAILED - Amazon FSx was unable to disassociate the DNS alias from the file system.
