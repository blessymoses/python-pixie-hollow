.. py:method:: FSx.Client.create_data_repository_task(**kwargs)

  

  Creates an Amazon FSx for Lustre data repository task. A ``CreateDataRepositoryTask`` operation will fail if a data repository is not linked to the FSx file system.

   

  You use import and export data repository tasks to perform bulk operations between your FSx for Lustre file system and its linked data repositories. An example of a data repository task is exporting any data and metadata changes, including POSIX metadata, to files, directories, and symbolic links (symlinks) from your FSx file system to a linked data repository.

   

  You use release data repository tasks to release data from your file system for files that are exported to S3. The metadata of released files remains on the file system so users or applications can still access released files by reading the files again, which will restore data from Amazon S3 to the FSx for Lustre file system.

   

  To learn more about data repository tasks, see `Data Repository Tasks <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/data-repository-tasks.html>`__. To learn more about linking a data repository to your file system, see `Linking your file system to an S3 bucket <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/create-dra-linked-data-repo.html>`__.

    )
    
  :type Type: string
  :param Type: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies the type of data repository task to create.

     

    
    * ``EXPORT_TO_REPOSITORY`` tasks export from your Amazon FSx for Lustre file system to a linked data repository.
     
    * ``IMPORT_METADATA_FROM_REPOSITORY`` tasks import metadata changes from a linked S3 bucket to your Amazon FSx for Lustre file system.
     
    * ``RELEASE_DATA_FROM_FILESYSTEM`` tasks release files in your Amazon FSx for Lustre file system that have been exported to a linked S3 bucket and that meet your specified release criteria.
     
    * ``AUTO_RELEASE_DATA`` tasks automatically release files from an Amazon File Cache resource.
    

    

  
  :type Paths: list
  :param Paths: 

    A list of paths for the data repository task to use when the task is processed. If a path that you provide isn't valid, the task fails. If you don't provide paths, the default behavior is to export all files to S3 (for export tasks), import all files from S3 (for import tasks), or release all exported files that meet the last accessed time criteria (for release tasks).

     

    
    * For export tasks, the list contains paths on the FSx for Lustre file system from which the files are exported to the Amazon S3 bucket. The default path is the file system root directory. The paths you provide need to be relative to the mount point of the file system. If the mount point is ``/mnt/fsx`` and ``/mnt/fsx/path1`` is a directory or file on the file system you want to export, then the path to provide is ``path1``.
     
    * For import tasks, the list contains paths in the Amazon S3 bucket from which POSIX metadata changes are imported to the FSx for Lustre file system. The path can be an S3 bucket or prefix in the format ``s3://bucket-name/prefix`` (where ``prefix`` is optional).
     
    * For release tasks, the list contains directory or file paths on the FSx for Lustre file system from which to release exported files. If a directory is specified, files within the directory are released. If a file path is specified, only that file is released. To release all exported files in the file system, specify a forward slash (/) as the path. 

    .. note::

      A file must also meet the last accessed time criteria specified in for the file to be released.

    
    

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type FileSystemId: string
  :param FileSystemId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The globally unique ID of the file system, assigned by Amazon FSx.

    

  
  :type Report: dict
  :param Report: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Defines whether or not Amazon FSx provides a CompletionReport once the task has completed. A CompletionReport provides a detailed report on the files that Amazon FSx processed that meet the criteria specified by the ``Scope`` parameter. For more information, see `Working with Task Completion Reports <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/task-completion-report.html>`__.

    

  
    - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      Set ``Enabled`` to ``True`` to generate a ``CompletionReport`` when the task completes. If set to ``true``, then you need to provide a report ``Scope``, ``Path``, and ``Format``. Set ``Enabled`` to ``False`` if you do not want a ``CompletionReport`` generated when the task completes.

      

    
    - **Path** *(string) --* 

      Required if ``Enabled`` is set to ``true``. Specifies the location of the report on the file system's linked S3 data repository. An absolute path that defines where the completion report will be stored in the destination location. The ``Path`` you provide must be located within the file system’s ExportPath. An example ``Path`` value is "s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/myExportPath/optionalPrefix". The report provides the following information for each file in the report: FilePath, FileStatus, and ErrorCode.

      

    
    - **Format** *(string) --* 

      Required if ``Enabled`` is set to ``true``. Specifies the format of the ``CompletionReport``. ``REPORT_CSV_20191124`` is the only format currently supported. When ``Format`` is set to ``REPORT_CSV_20191124``, the ``CompletionReport`` is provided in CSV format, and is delivered to ``{path}/task-{id}/failures.csv``.

      

    
    - **Scope** *(string) --* 

      Required if ``Enabled`` is set to ``true``. Specifies the scope of the ``CompletionReport``; ``FAILED_FILES_ONLY`` is the only scope currently supported. When ``Scope`` is set to ``FAILED_FILES_ONLY``, the ``CompletionReport`` only contains information about files that the data repository task failed to process.

      

    
  
  :type ClientRequestToken: string
  :param ClientRequestToken: 

    (Optional) An idempotency token for resource creation, in a string of up to 63 ASCII characters. This token is automatically filled on your behalf when you use the Command Line Interface (CLI) or an Amazon Web Services SDK.

    This field is autopopulated if not provided.

  
  :type Tags: list
  :param Tags: 

    A list of ``Tag`` values, with a maximum of 50 elements.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      Specifies a key-value pair for a resource tag.

      

    
      - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        A value that specifies the ``TagKey``, the name of the tag. Tag keys must be unique for the resource to which they are attached.

        

      
      - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        A value that specifies the ``TagValue``, the value assigned to the corresponding tag key. Tag values can be null and don't have to be unique in a tag set. For example, you can have a key-value pair in a tag set of ``finances : April`` and also of ``payroll : April``.

        

      
    

  :type CapacityToRelease: integer
  :param CapacityToRelease: 

    Specifies the amount of data to release, in GiB, by an Amazon File Cache ``AUTO_RELEASE_DATA`` task that automatically releases files from the cache.

    

  
  :type ReleaseConfiguration: dict
  :param ReleaseConfiguration: 

    The configuration that specifies the last accessed time criteria for files that will be released from an Amazon FSx for Lustre file system.

    

  
    - **DurationSinceLastAccess** *(dict) --* 

      Defines the point-in-time since an exported file was last accessed, in order for that file to be eligible for release. Only files that were last accessed before this point-in-time are eligible to be released from the file system.

      

    
      - **Unit** *(string) --* 

        The unit of time used by the ``Value`` parameter to determine if a file can be released, based on when it was last accessed. ``DAYS`` is the only supported value. This is a required parameter.

        

      
      - **Value** *(integer) --* 

        An integer that represents the minimum amount of time (in days) since a file was last accessed in the file system. Only exported files with a ``MAX(atime, ctime, mtime)`` timestamp that is more than this amount of time in the past (relative to the task create time) will be released. The default of ``Value`` is ``0``. This is a required parameter.

         

        .. note::

          

          If an exported file meets the last accessed time criteria, its file or directory path must also be specified in the ``Paths`` parameter of the operation in order for the file to be released.
