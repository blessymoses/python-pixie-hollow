.. py:method:: LocationService.Client.create_route_calculator(**kwargs)

  

  

  .. warning::

    

    This operation is no longer current and may be deprecated in the future. We recommend you upgrade to the Routes API V2 unless you require Grab data.

     

    
    * ``CreateRouteCalculator`` is part of a previous Amazon Location Service Routes API (version 1) which has been superseded by a more intuitive, powerful, and complete API (version 2).
     
    * The Routes API version 2 has a simplified interface that can be used without creating or managing route calculator resources.
     
    * If you are using an Amazon Web Services SDK or the Amazon Web Services CLI, note that the Routes API version 2 is found under ``geo-routes`` or ``geo_routes``, not under ``location``.
     
    * Since Grab is not yet fully supported in Routes API version 2, we recommend you continue using API version 1 when using Grab.
     
    * Start your version 2 API journey with the Routes V2 `API Reference </location/latest/APIReference/API_Operations_Amazon_Location_Service_Routes_V2.html>`__ or the `Developer Guide </location/latest/developerguide/routes.html>`__.
    

    

   

  Creates a route calculator resource in your Amazon Web Services account.

   

  You can send requests to a route calculator resource to estimate travel time, distance, and get directions. A route calculator sources traffic and road network data from your chosen data provider.

   

  .. note::

    

    If your application is tracking or routing assets you use in your business, such as delivery vehicles or employees, you must not use Esri as your geolocation provider. See section 82 of the `Amazon Web Services service terms <http://aws.amazon.com/service-terms>`__ for more details.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.create_route_calculator(
        CalculatorName='string',
        DataSource='string',
        PricingPlan='RequestBasedUsage'|'MobileAssetTracking'|'MobileAssetManagement',
        Description='string',
        Tags={
            'string': 'string'
        }
    )
    
  :type CalculatorName: string
  :param CalculatorName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of the route calculator resource.

     

    Requirements:

     

    
    * Can use alphanumeric characters (A–Z, a–z, 0–9) , hyphens (-), periods (.), and underscores (_).
     
    * Must be a unique Route calculator resource name.
     
    * No spaces allowed. For example, ``ExampleRouteCalculator``.
    

    

  
  :type DataSource: string
  :param DataSource: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies the data provider of traffic and road network data.

     

    .. note::

      

      This field is case-sensitive. Enter the valid values as shown. For example, entering ``HERE`` returns an error.

      

     

    Valid values include:

     

    
    * ``Esri`` – For additional information about `Esri <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/location/previous/developerguide/esri.html>`__'s coverage in your region of interest, see `Esri details on street networks and traffic coverage <https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/reference/network-coverage.htm>`__. Route calculators that use Esri as a data source only calculate routes that are shorter than 400 km.
     
    * ``Grab`` – Grab provides routing functionality for Southeast Asia. For additional information about `GrabMaps <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/location/previous/developerguide/grab.html>`__' coverage, see `GrabMaps countries and areas covered <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/location/previous/developerguide/grab.html#grab-coverage-area>`__.
     
    * ``Here`` – For additional information about `HERE Technologies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/location/previous/developerguide/HERE.html>`__' coverage in your region of interest, see `HERE car routing coverage <https://developer.here.com/documentation/routing-api/dev_guide/topics/coverage/car-routing.html>`__ and `HERE truck routing coverage <https://developer.here.com/documentation/routing-api/dev_guide/topics/coverage/truck-routing.html>`__.

  :param Description: 

    The optional description for the route calculator resource.

    

  
  :type Tags: dict
  :param Tags: 

    Applies one or more tags to the route calculator resource. A tag is a key-value pair helps manage, identify, search, and filter your resources by labelling them.

    Format: ``"key" : "value"``

     

    Restrictions:
