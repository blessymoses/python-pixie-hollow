.. py:method:: LocationService.Client.delete_place_index(**kwargs)

  

  

  .. warning::

    

    This operation is no longer current and may be deprecated in the future. We recommend you upgrade to the Places API V2 unless you require Grab data.

     

    
    * ``DeletePlaceIndex`` is part of a previous Amazon Location Service Places API (version 1) which has been superseded by a more intuitive, powerful, and complete API (version 2).
     
    * The Places API version 2 has a simplified interface that can be used without creating or managing place index resources.
     
    * If you are using an Amazon Web Services SDK or the Amazon Web Services CLI, note that the Places API version 2 is found under ``geo-places`` or ``geo_places``, not under ``location``.
     
    * Since Grab is not yet fully supported in Places API version 2, we recommend you continue using API version 1 when using Grab.
     
    * Start your version 2 API journey with the Places V2 `API Reference </location/latest/APIReference/API_Operations_Amazon_Location_Service_Places_V2.html>`__ or the `Developer Guide </location/latest/developerguide/places.html>`__.
