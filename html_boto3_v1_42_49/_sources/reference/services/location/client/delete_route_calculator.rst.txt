.. py:method:: LocationService.Client.delete_route_calculator(**kwargs)

  

  

  .. warning::

    

    This operation is no longer current and may be deprecated in the future. We recommend you upgrade to the Routes API V2 unless you require Grab data.

     

    
    * ``DeleteRouteCalculator`` is part of a previous Amazon Location Service Routes API (version 1) which has been superseded by a more intuitive, powerful, and complete API (version 2).
     
    * The Routes API version 2 has a simplified interface that can be used without creating or managing route calculator resources.
     
    * If you are using an Amazon Web Services SDK or the Amazon Web Services CLI, note that the Routes API version 2 is found under ``geo-routes`` or ``geo_routes``, not under ``location``.
     
    * Since Grab is not yet fully supported in Routes API version 2, we recommend you continue using API version 1 when using Grab.
     
    * Start your version 2 API journey with the Routes V2 `API Reference </location/latest/APIReference/API_Operations_Amazon_Location_Service_Routes_V2.html>`__ or the `Developer Guide </location/latest/developerguide/routes.html>`__.
