.. py:method:: LocationService.Client.delete_map(**kwargs)

  

  

  .. warning::

    

    This operation is no longer current and may be deprecated in the future. We recommend upgrading to the Maps API V2 unless you require ``Grab`` data.

     

    
    * ``DeleteMap`` is part of a previous Amazon Location Service Maps API (version 1) which has been superseded by a more intuitive, powerful, and complete API (version 2).
     
    * The Maps API version 2 has a simplified interface that can be used without creating or managing map resources.
     
    * If you are using an AWS SDK or the AWS CLI, note that the Maps API version 2 is found under ``geo-maps`` or ``geo_maps``, not under ``location``.
     
    * Since ``Grab`` is not yet fully supported in Maps API version 2, we recommend you continue using API version 1 when using ``Grab``.
     
    * Start your version 2 API journey with the `Maps V2 API Reference <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/location/latest/APIReference/API_Operations_Amazon_Location_Service_Maps_V2.html>`__ or the `Developer Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/location/latest/developerguide/maps.html>`__.
    

    

   

  Deletes a map resource from your Amazon Web Services account.
