.. py:method:: LocationService.Client.get_place(**kwargs)

  

  

  .. warning::

    

    This operation is no longer current and may be deprecated in the future. We recommend you upgrade to the `V2 GetPlace </location/latest/APIReference/API_geoplaces_GetPlace.html>`__ operation unless you require Grab data.

     

    
    * This version of ``GetPlace`` is part of a previous Amazon Location Service Places API (version 1) which has been superseded by a more intuitive, powerful, and complete API (version 2).
     
    * Version 2 of the ``GetPlace`` operation interoperates with the rest of the Places V2 API, while this version does not.
     
    * If you are using an Amazon Web Services SDK or the Amazon Web Services CLI, note that the Places API version 2 is found under ``geo-places`` or ``geo_places``, not under ``location``.
     
    * Since Grab is not yet fully supported in Places API version 2, we recommend you continue using API version 1 when using Grab.
     
    * Start your version 2 API journey with the Places V2 `API Reference </location/latest/APIReference/API_Operations_Amazon_Location_Service_Places_V2.html>`__ or the `Developer Guide </location/latest/developerguide/places.html>`__.
    

    

   

  Finds a place by its unique ID. A ``PlaceId`` is returned by other search operations.

   

  .. note::

    

    A PlaceId is valid only if all of the following are the same in the original search request and the call to ``GetPlace``.

     

    
    * Customer Amazon Web Services account
     
    * Amazon Web Services Region
     
    * Data provider specified in the place index resource
    

    

   

  .. note::

    

    If your Place index resource is configured with Grab as your geolocation provider and Storage as Intended use, the GetPlace operation is unavailable. For more information, see `AWS service terms <http://aws.amazon.com/service-terms>`__.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.get_place(
        IndexName='string',
        PlaceId='string',
        Language='string',
        Key='string'
    )
    
  :type IndexName: string
  :param IndexName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of the place index resource that you want to use for the search.

    

  
  :type PlaceId: string
  :param PlaceId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The identifier of the place to find.

    

  
  :type Language: string
  :param Language: 

    The preferred language used to return results. The value must be a valid `BCP 47 <https://tools.ietf.org/search/bcp47>`__ language tag, for example, ``en`` for English.

     

    This setting affects the languages used in the results, but not the results themselves. If no language is specified, or not supported for a particular result, the partner automatically chooses a language for the result.

     

    For an example, we'll use the Greek language. You search for a location around Athens, Greece, with the ``language`` parameter set to ``en``. The ``city`` in the results will most likely be returned as ``Athens``.

     

    If you set the ``language`` parameter to ``el``, for Greek, then the ``city`` in the results will more likely be returned as ``Αθήνα``.

     

    If the data provider does not have a value for Greek, the result will be in a language that the provider does support.

    

  
  :type Key: string
  :param Key: 

    The optional `API key <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/location/previous/developerguide/using-apikeys.html>`__ to authorize the request.
