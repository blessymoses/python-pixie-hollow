    - **Hosts** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      Specifies the location of the LDAP server such as Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory. Optional failover server.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    - **RoleBase** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The distinguished name of the node in the directory information tree (DIT) to search for roles or groups. For example, ou=group, ou=corp, dc=corp, dc=example, dc=com.

      

    
    - **RoleName** *(string) --* 

      Specifies the LDAP attribute that identifies the group name attribute in the object returned from the group membership query.

      

    
    - **RoleSearchMatching** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The LDAP search filter used to find roles within the roleBase. The distinguished name of the user matched by userSearchMatching is substituted into the {0} placeholder in the search filter. The client's username is substituted into the {1} placeholder. For example, if you set this option to (member=uid={1})for the user janedoe, the search filter becomes (member=uid=janedoe) after string substitution. It matches all role entries that have a member attribute equal to uid=janedoe under the subtree selected by the roleBase.

      

    
    - **RoleSearchSubtree** *(boolean) --* 

      The directory search scope for the role. If set to true, scope is to search the entire subtree.

    - **ServiceAccountUsername** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      Service account username. A service account is an account in your LDAP server that has access to initiate a connection. For example, cn=admin,dc=corp, dc=example, dc=com.

      

    
    - **UserBase** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      Select a particular subtree of the directory information tree (DIT) to search for user entries. The subtree is specified by a DN, which specifies the base node of the subtree. For example, by setting this option to ou=Users,ou=corp, dc=corp, dc=example, dc=com, the search for user entries is restricted to the subtree beneath ou=Users, ou=corp, dc=corp, dc=example, dc=com.

      

    
    - **UserRoleName** *(string) --* 

      Specifies the name of the LDAP attribute for the user group membership.

      

    
    - **UserSearchMatching** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The LDAP search filter used to find users within the userBase. The client's username is substituted into the {0} placeholder in the search filter. For example, if this option is set to (uid={0}) and the received username is janedoe, the search filter becomes (uid=janedoe) after string substitution. It will result in matching an entry like uid=janedoe, ou=Users,ou=corp, dc=corp, dc=example, dc=com.

      

    
    - **UserSearchSubtree** *(boolean) --* 

      The directory search scope for the user. If set to true, scope is to search the entire subtree.

A SINGLE_INSTANCE deployment requires one subnet (for example, the default subnet). An ACTIVE_STANDBY_MULTI_AZ Amazon MQ for ActiveMQ deployment requires two subnets. A CLUSTER_MULTI_AZ Amazon MQ for RabbitMQ deployment has no subnet requirements when deployed with public accessibility. Deployment without public accessibility requires at least one subnet.

     

    .. warning::

      

      If you specify subnets in a `shared VPC <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-sharing.html>`__ for a RabbitMQ broker, the associated VPC to which the specified subnets belong must be owned by your Amazon Web Services account.

        * para>For Amazon MQ for RabbitMQ brokers, this value can contain only alphanumeric characters, dashes, periods, underscores (- . _). This value must not contain a tilde (~) character. Amazon MQ prohibts using guest as a valid usename. This value must be 2-100 characters long.
