  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_compliance_status(
        PolicyId='string',
        NextToken='string',
        MaxResults=123
    )
    
  :type PolicyId: string
  :param PolicyId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ID of the Firewall Manager policy that you want the details for.

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    If you specify a value for ``MaxResults`` and you have more ``PolicyComplianceStatus`` objects than the number that you specify for ``MaxResults``, Firewall Manager returns a ``NextToken`` value in the response that allows you to list another group of ``PolicyComplianceStatus`` objects. For the second and subsequent ``ListComplianceStatus`` requests, specify the value of ``NextToken`` from the previous response to get information about another batch of ``PolicyComplianceStatus`` objects.

    

  
  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    Specifies the number of ``PolicyComplianceStatus`` objects that you want Firewall Manager to return for this request. If you have more ``PolicyComplianceStatus`` objects than the number that you specify for ``MaxResults``, the response includes a ``NextToken`` value that you can use to get another batch of ``PolicyComplianceStatus`` objects.
