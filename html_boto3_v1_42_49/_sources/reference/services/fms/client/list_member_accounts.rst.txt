.. py:method:: FMS.Client.list_member_accounts(**kwargs)

  

  Returns a ``MemberAccounts`` object that lists the member accounts in the administrator's Amazon Web Services organization.

   

  Either an Firewall Manager administrator or the organization's management account can make this request.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_member_accounts(
        NextToken='string',
        MaxResults=123
    )
    
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    If you specify a value for ``MaxResults`` and you have more account IDs than the number that you specify for ``MaxResults``, Firewall Manager returns a ``NextToken`` value in the response that allows you to list another group of IDs. For the second and subsequent ``ListMemberAccountsRequest`` requests, specify the value of ``NextToken`` from the previous response to get information about another batch of member account IDs.

    

  
  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    Specifies the number of member account IDs that you want Firewall Manager to return for this request. If you have more IDs than the number that you specify for ``MaxResults``, the response includes a ``NextToken`` value that you can use to get another batch of member account IDs.
