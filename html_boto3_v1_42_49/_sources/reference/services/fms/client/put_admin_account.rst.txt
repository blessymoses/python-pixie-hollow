.. py:method:: FMS.Client.put_admin_account(**kwargs)

  

  Creates or updates an Firewall Manager administrator account. The account must be a member of the organization that was onboarded to Firewall Manager by  AssociateAdminAccount. Only the organization's management account can create an Firewall Manager administrator account. When you create an Firewall Manager administrator account, the service checks to see if the account is already a delegated administrator within Organizations. If the account isn't a delegated administrator, Firewall Manager calls Organizations to delegate the account within Organizations. For more information about administrator accounts within Organizations, see `Managing the Amazon Web Services Accounts in Your Organization <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts.html>`__.
