  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_admins_managing_account(
        NextToken='string',
        MaxResults=123
    )
    
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    When you request a list of objects with a ``MaxResults`` setting, if the number of objects that are still available for retrieval exceeds the maximum you requested, Firewall Manager returns a ``NextToken`` value in the response. To retrieve the next batch of objects, use the token returned from the prior request in your next request.

    

  
  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    The maximum number of objects that you want Firewall Manager to return for this request. If more objects are available, in the response, Firewall Manager provides a ``NextToken`` value that you can use in a subsequent call to get the next batch of objects.
