        ],
        ResourceType='string',

    )
    
  :type MemberAccountIds: list
  :param MemberAccountIds: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The Amazon Web Services account IDs to discover resources in. Only one account is supported per request. The account must be a member of your organization.

    The type of resources to discover.

    

  
  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    The maximum number of objects that you want Firewall Manager to return for this request. If more objects are available, in the response, Firewall Manager provides a ``NextToken`` value that you can use in a subsequent call to get the next batch of objects.

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    When you request a list of objects with a ``MaxResults`` setting, if the number of objects that are still available for retrieval exceeds the maximum you requested, Firewall Manager returns a ``NextToken`` value in the response.
