  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_event_sources(
        NamePrefix='string',
        NextToken='string',
        Limit=123
    )
    
  :type NamePrefix: string
  :param NamePrefix: 

    Specifying this limits the results to only those partner event sources with names that start with the specified prefix.

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    The token returned by a previous call, which you can use to retrieve the next set of results.

     

    The value of ``nextToken`` is a unique pagination token for each page. To retrieve the next page of results, make the call again using the returned token. Keep all other arguments unchanged.

     

    Using an expired pagination token results in an ``HTTP 400 InvalidToken`` error.

    

  
  :type Limit: integer
  :param Limit: 

    Specifying this limits the number of results returned by this operation. The operation also returns a NextToken which you can use in a subsequent operation to retrieve the next set of results.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **EventSources** *(list) --* 

        The list of event sources.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          A partner event source is created by an SaaS partner. If a customer creates a partner event bus that matches this event source, that Amazon Web Services account can receive events from the partner's applications or services.

          
          

          - **Arn** *(string) --* 

            The ARN of the event source.

            
          

          - **CreatedBy** *(string) --* 

            The name of the partner that created the event source.

            
          

          - **CreationTime** *(datetime) --* 

            The date and time the event source was created.

            
          

          - **ExpirationTime** *(datetime) --* 

            The date and time that the event source will expire, if the Amazon Web Services account doesn't create a matching event bus for it.

            
          

          - **Name** *(string) --* 

            The name of the event source.

            
          

          - **State** *(string) --* 

            The state of the event source. If it is ACTIVE, you have already created a matching event bus for this event source, and that event bus is active. If it is PENDING, either you haven't yet created a matching event bus, or that event bus is deactivated. If it is DELETED, you have created a matching event bus, but the event source has since been deleted.

            
      
    
      

      - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

        A token indicating there are more results available. If there are no more results, no token is included in the response.

         

        The value of ``nextToken`` is a unique pagination token for each page. To retrieve the next page of results, make the call again using the returned token. Keep all other arguments unchanged.

         

        Using an expired pagination token results in an ``HTTP 400 InvalidToken`` error.
