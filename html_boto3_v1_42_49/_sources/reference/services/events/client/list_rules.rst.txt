.. py:method:: EventBridge.Client.list_rules(**kwargs)

  

  Lists your Amazon EventBridge rules. You can either list all the rules or you can provide a prefix to match to the rule names.

   

  The maximum number of results per page for requests is 100.

   

  ListRules does not list the targets of a rule. To see the targets associated with a rule, use `ListTargetsByRule <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/APIReference/API_ListTargetsByRule.html>`__.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_rules(
        NamePrefix='string',
        EventBusName='string',
        NextToken='string',
        Limit=123
    )
    
  :type NamePrefix: string
  :param NamePrefix: 

    The prefix matching the rule name.

    

  
  :type EventBusName: string
  :param EventBusName: 

    The name or ARN of the event bus to list the rules for. If you omit this, the default event bus is used.

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    The token returned by a previous call, which you can use to retrieve the next set of results.

     

    The value of ``nextToken`` is a unique pagination token for each page. To retrieve the next page of results, make the call again using the returned token. Keep all other arguments unchanged.

     

    Using an expired pagination token results in an ``HTTP 400 InvalidToken`` error.

    

  
  :type Limit: integer
  :param Limit: 

    The maximum number of results to return.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **Rules** *(list) --* 

        The rules that match the specified criteria.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          Contains information about a rule in Amazon EventBridge.

          
          

          - **Name** *(string) --* 

            The name of the rule.

            
          

          - **Arn** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the rule.

            
          

          - **EventPattern** *(string) --* 

            The event pattern of the rule. For more information, see `Events and Event Patterns <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eventbridge-and-event-patterns.html>`__ in the *Amazon EventBridge User Guide* .

            
          

          - **State** *(string) --* 

            The state of the rule.

             

            Valid values include:

             

            
            * ``DISABLED``: The rule is disabled. EventBridge does not match any events against the rule.
             
            * ``ENABLED``: The rule is enabled. EventBridge matches events against the rule, *except* for Amazon Web Services management events delivered through CloudTrail.
             
            * ``ENABLED_WITH_ALL_CLOUDTRAIL_MANAGEMENT_EVENTS``: The rule is enabled for all events, including Amazon Web Services management events delivered through CloudTrail. Management events provide visibility into management operations that are performed on resources in your Amazon Web Services account. These are also known as control plane operations. For more information, see `Logging management events <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-management-events-with-cloudtrail.html#logging-management-events>`__ in the *CloudTrail User Guide*, and `Filtering management events from Amazon Web Services services <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-service-event.html#eb-service-event-cloudtrail>`__ in the *Amazon EventBridge User Guide* . This value is only valid for rules on the `default <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-what-is-how-it-works-concepts.html#eb-bus-concepts-buses>`__ event bus or `custom event buses <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-create-event-bus.html>`__. It does not apply to `partner event buses <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-saas.html>`__.
            

            
          

          - **Description** *(string) --* 

            The description of the rule.

            
          

          - **ScheduleExpression** *(string) --* 

            The scheduling expression. For example, "cron(0 20 * * ? *)", "rate(5 minutes)". For more information, see `Creating an Amazon EventBridge rule that runs on a schedule <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-create-rule-schedule.html>`__.

            
          

          - **RoleArn** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the role that is used for target invocation.

             

            If you're setting an event bus in another account as the target and that account granted permission to your account through an organization instead of directly by the account ID, you must specify a ``RoleArn`` with proper permissions in the ``Target`` structure, instead of here in this parameter.

            
          

          - **ManagedBy** *(string) --* 

            If the rule was created on behalf of your account by an Amazon Web Services service, this field displays the principal name of the service that created the rule.

            
          

          - **EventBusName** *(string) --* 

            The name or ARN of the event bus associated with the rule. If you omit this, the default event bus is used.

            
      
    
      

      - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

        A token indicating there are more results available. If there are no more results, no token is included in the response.

         

        The value of ``nextToken`` is a unique pagination token for each page. To retrieve the next page of results, make the call again using the returned token. Keep all other arguments unchanged.

         

        Using an expired pagination token results in an ``HTTP 400 InvalidToken`` error.
