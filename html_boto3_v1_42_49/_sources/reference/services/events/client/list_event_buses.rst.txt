  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_event_buses(
        NamePrefix='string',
        NextToken='string',
        Limit=123
    )
    
  :type NamePrefix: string
  :param NamePrefix: 

    Specifying this limits the results to only those event buses with names that start with the specified prefix.

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    The token returned by a previous call, which you can use to retrieve the next set of results.

     

    The value of ``nextToken`` is a unique pagination token for each page. To retrieve the next page of results, make the call again using the returned token. Keep all other arguments unchanged.

     

    Using an expired pagination token results in an ``HTTP 400 InvalidToken`` error.

    

  
  :type Limit: integer
  :param Limit: 

    Specifying this limits the number of results returned by this operation. The operation also returns a NextToken which you can use in a subsequent operation to retrieve the next set of results.

        - *(dict) --* 

          An event bus receives events from a source, uses rules to evaluate them, applies any configured input transformation, and routes them to the appropriate target(s). Your account's default event bus receives events from Amazon Web Services services. A custom event bus can receive events from your custom applications and services. A partner event bus receives events from an event source created by an SaaS partner. These events come from the partners services or applications.

          
          

          - **Name** *(string) --* 

            The name of the event bus.

            
          

          - **Arn** *(string) --* 

            The ARN of the event bus.

            
          

          - **Description** *(string) --* 

            The event bus description.

            
          

          - **Policy** *(string) --* 

            The permissions policy of the event bus, describing which other Amazon Web Services accounts can write events to this event bus.

            
          

          - **CreationTime** *(datetime) --* 

            The time the event bus was created.

            
          

          - **LastModifiedTime** *(datetime) --* 

            The time the event bus was last modified.

            
      
    
      

      - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

        A token indicating there are more results available. If there are no more results, no token is included in the response.

         

        The value of ``nextToken`` is a unique pagination token for each page. To retrieve the next page of results, make the call again using the returned token. Keep all other arguments unchanged.

         

        Using an expired pagination token results in an ``HTTP 400 InvalidToken`` error.
