  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_partner_event_sources(
        NamePrefix='string',
        NextToken='string',
        Limit=123
    )
    
  :type NamePrefix: string
  :param NamePrefix: **[REQUIRED]** 

    If you specify this, the results are limited to only those partner event sources that start with the string you specify.

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    The token returned by a previous call, which you can use to retrieve the next set of results.

     

    The value of ``nextToken`` is a unique pagination token for each page. To retrieve the next page of results, make the call again using the returned token. Keep all other arguments unchanged.

     

    Using an expired pagination token results in an ``HTTP 400 InvalidToken`` error.

    

  
  :type Limit: integer
  :param Limit: 

    pecifying this limits the number of results returned by this operation. The operation also returns a NextToken which you can use in a subsequent operation to retrieve the next set of results.

          A partner event source is created by an SaaS partner. If a customer creates a partner event bus that matches this event source, that Amazon Web Services account can receive events from the partner's applications or services.

          
          

          - **Arn** *(string) --*

      - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

        A token indicating there are more results available. If there are no more results, no token is included in the response.

         

        The value of ``nextToken`` is a unique pagination token for each page. To retrieve the next page of results, make the call again using the returned token. Keep all other arguments unchanged.

         

        Using an expired pagination token results in an ``HTTP 400 InvalidToken`` error.
