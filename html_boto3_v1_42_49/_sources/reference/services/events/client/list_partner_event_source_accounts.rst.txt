  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_partner_event_source_accounts(
        EventSourceName='string',
        NextToken='string',
        Limit=123
    )
    
  :type EventSourceName: string
  :param EventSourceName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of the partner event source to display account information about.

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    The token returned by a previous call, which you can use to retrieve the next set of results.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **PartnerEventSourceAccounts** *(list) --* 

        The list of partner event sources returned by the operation.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          The Amazon Web Services account that a partner event source has been offered to.

          
          

          - **Account** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Web Services account ID that the partner event source was offered to.

            
          

          - **CreationTime** *(datetime) --* 

            The date and time the event source was created.

            
          

          - **ExpirationTime** *(datetime) --* 

            The date and time that the event source will expire, if the Amazon Web Services account doesn't create a matching event bus for it.

            
          

          - **State** *(string) --* 

            The state of the event source. If it is ACTIVE, you have already created a matching event bus for this event source, and that event bus is active. If it is PENDING, either you haven't yet created a matching event bus, or that event bus is deactivated. If it is DELETED, you have created a matching event bus, but the event source has since been deleted.

            
      
    
      

      - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

        A token indicating there are more results available. If there are no more results, no token is included in the response.

         

        The value of ``nextToken`` is a unique pagination token for each page. To retrieve the next page of results, make the call again using the returned token. Keep all other arguments unchanged.

         

        Using an expired pagination token results in an ``HTTP 400 InvalidToken`` error.
