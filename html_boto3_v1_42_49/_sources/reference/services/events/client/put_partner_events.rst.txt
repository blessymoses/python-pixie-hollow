.. py:method:: EventBridge.Client.put_partner_events(**kwargs)

  

  This is used by SaaS partners to write events to a customer's partner event bus. Amazon Web Services customers do not use this operation.

   

  For information on calculating event batch size, see `Calculating EventBridge PutEvents event entry size <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-putevent-size.html>`__ in the *EventBridge User Guide*.

            },
        ]
    )
    
  :type Entries: list
  :param Entries: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The list of events to write to the event bus.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      The details about an event generated by an SaaS partner.

      

    
      - **Time** *(datetime) --* 

        The date and time of the event.

        

      
      - **Source** *(string) --*

        .. note::

          

          ``Detail``, ``DetailType``, and ``Source`` are required for EventBridge to successfully send an event to an event bus. If you include event entries in a request that do not include each of those properties, EventBridge fails that entry. If you submit a request in which *none* of the entries have each of these properties, EventBridge fails the entire request.

          

        

      
      - **Resources** *(list) --* 

        Amazon Web Services resources, identified by Amazon Resource Name (ARN), which the event primarily concerns. Any number, including zero, may be present.

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
    
      - **DetailType** *(string) --* 

        A free-form string, with a maximum of 128 characters, used to decide what fields to expect in the event detail.

      - **Detail** *(string) --* 

        A valid JSON string. There is no other schema imposed. The JSON string may contain fields and nested sub-objects.

      - **Entries** *(list) --* 

        The results for each event entry the partner submitted in this request. If the event was successfully submitted, the entry has the event ID in it. Otherwise, you can use the error code and error message to identify the problem with the entry.
