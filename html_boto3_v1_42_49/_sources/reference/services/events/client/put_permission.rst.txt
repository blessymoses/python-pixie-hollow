.. py:method:: EventBridge.Client.put_permission(**kwargs)

  

  Running ``PutPermission`` permits the specified Amazon Web Services account or Amazon Web Services organization to put events to the specified *event bus*. Amazon EventBridge rules in your account are triggered by these events arriving to an event bus in your account.

   

  For another account to send events to your account, that external account must have an EventBridge rule with your account's event bus as a target.

   

  To enable multiple Amazon Web Services accounts to put events to your event bus, run ``PutPermission`` once for each of these accounts. Or, if all the accounts are members of the same Amazon Web Services organization, you can run ``PutPermission`` once specifying ``Principal`` as "*" and specifying the Amazon Web Services organization ID in ``Condition``, to grant permissions to all accounts in that organization.

   

  If you grant permissions using an organization, then accounts in that organization must specify a ``RoleArn`` with proper permissions when they use ``PutTarget`` to add your account's event bus as a target. For more information, see `Sending and Receiving Events Between Amazon Web Services Accounts <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eventbridge-cross-account-event-delivery.html>`__ in the *Amazon EventBridge User Guide*.

   

  The permission policy on the event bus cannot exceed 10 KB in size.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.put_permission(
        EventBusName='string',
        Action='string',
        Principal='string',
        StatementId='string',
        Condition={
            'Type': 'string',
            'Key': 'string',
            'Value': 'string'
        },
        Policy='string'
    )
    
  :type EventBusName: string
  :param EventBusName: 

    The name of the event bus associated with the rule. If you omit this, the default event bus is used.

    

  
  :type Action: string
  :param Action: 

    The action that you are enabling the other account to perform.

    

  
  :type Principal: string
  :param Principal: 

    The 12-digit Amazon Web Services account ID that you are permitting to put events to your default event bus. Specify "*" to permit any account to put events to your default event bus.

     

    If you specify "*" without specifying ``Condition``, avoid creating rules that may match undesirable events. To create more secure rules, make sure that the event pattern for each rule contains an ``account`` field with a specific account ID from which to receive events. Rules with an account field do not match any events sent from other accounts.

    

  
  :type StatementId: string
  :param StatementId: 

    An identifier string for the external account that you are granting permissions to. If you later want to revoke the permission for this external account, specify this ``StatementId`` when you run `RemovePermission <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/APIReference/API_RemovePermission.html>`__.

     

    .. note::

      

      Each ``StatementId`` must be unique.

      

    

  
  :type Condition: dict
  :param Condition: 

    This parameter enables you to limit the permission to accounts that fulfill a certain condition, such as being a member of a certain Amazon Web Services organization. For more information about Amazon Web Services Organizations, see `What Is Amazon Web Services Organizations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_introduction.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services Organizations User Guide*.

     

    If you specify ``Condition`` with an Amazon Web Services organization ID, and specify "*" as the value for ``Principal``, you grant permission to all the accounts in the named organization.

     

    The ``Condition`` is a JSON string which must contain ``Type``, ``Key``, and ``Value`` fields.

    

  
    - **Type** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      Specifies the type of condition. Currently the only supported value is ``StringEquals``.

      

    
    - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      Specifies the key for the condition. Currently the only supported key is ``aws:PrincipalOrgID``.

      

    
    - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      Specifies the value for the key. Currently, this must be the ID of the organization.

      

    
  
  :type Policy: string
  :param Policy: 

    A JSON string that describes the permission policy statement. You can include a ``Policy`` parameter in the request instead of using the ``StatementId``, ``Action``, ``Principal``, or ``Condition`` parameters.
