    )
    
  :type reportArn: string
  :param reportArn: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ARN of the report for which test cases are returned.

    

  
  :type nextToken: string
  :param nextToken: 

    The ``nextToken`` value returned from a previous call to ``DescribeCodeCoverages``. This specifies the next item to return. To return the beginning of the list, exclude this parameter.

  :param maxResults: 

    The maximum number of results to return.

    

  
  :type sortOrder: string
  :param sortOrder: 

    Specifies if the results are sorted in ascending or descending order.

    

  
  :type sortBy: string
  :param sortBy: 

    Specifies how the results are sorted. Possible values are:

      FILE_PATH  

    The results are sorted by file path.

      LINE_COVERAGE_PERCENTAGE  

    The results are sorted by the percentage of lines that are covered.

    

  
  :type minLineCoveragePercentage: float
  :param minLineCoveragePercentage: 

    The minimum line coverage percentage to report.

    

  
  :type maxLineCoveragePercentage: float
  :param maxLineCoveragePercentage: 

    The maximum line coverage percentage to report.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **nextToken** *(string) --* 

        If there are more items to return, this contains a token that is passed to a subsequent call to ``DescribeCodeCoverages`` to retrieve the next set of items.

        
      

      - **codeCoverages** *(list) --* 

        An array of ``CodeCoverage`` objects that contain the results.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          Contains code coverage report information.

           

          Line coverage measures how many statements your tests cover. A statement is a single instruction, not including comments, conditionals, etc.

           

          Branch coverage determines if your tests cover every possible branch of a control structure, such as an ``if`` or ``case`` statement.

          
          

          - **id** *(string) --* 

            The identifier of the code coverage report.

            
          

          - **reportARN** *(string) --* 

            The ARN of the report.

            
          

          - **filePath** *(string) --* 

            The path of the test report file.

            
          

          - **lineCoveragePercentage** *(float) --* 

            The percentage of lines that are covered by your tests.

            
          

          - **linesCovered** *(integer) --* 

            The number of lines that are covered by your tests.

            
          

          - **linesMissed** *(integer) --* 

            The number of lines that are not covered by your tests.

            
          

          - **branchCoveragePercentage** *(float) --* 

            The percentage of branches that are covered by your tests.

            
          

          - **branchesCovered** *(integer) --* 

            The number of conditional branches that are covered by your tests.

            
          

          - **branchesMissed** *(integer) --* 

            The number of conditional branches that are not covered by your tests.
