  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_reports_for_report_group(
        reportGroupArn='string',
        nextToken='string',
        sortOrder='ASCENDING'|'DESCENDING',
        maxResults=123,
        filter={
            'status': 'GENERATING'|'SUCCEEDED'|'FAILED'|'INCOMPLETE'|'DELETING'
        }
    )
    
  :type reportGroupArn: string
  :param reportGroupArn: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ARN of the report group for which you want to return report ARNs.

    

  
  :type nextToken: string
  :param nextToken: 

    During a previous call, the maximum number of items that can be returned is the value specified in ``maxResults``. If there more items in the list, then a unique string called a *nextToken* is returned. To get the next batch of items in the list, call this operation again, adding the next token to the call. To get all of the items in the list, keep calling this operation with each subsequent next token that is returned, until no more next tokens are returned.

    

  
  :type sortOrder: string
  :param sortOrder: 

    Use to specify whether the results are returned in ascending or descending order.

    

  
  :type maxResults: integer
  :param maxResults: 

    The maximum number of paginated reports in this report group returned per response. Use ``nextToken`` to iterate pages in the list of returned ``Report`` objects. The default value is 100.

    

  
  :type filter: dict
  :param filter: 

    A ``ReportFilter`` object used to filter the returned reports.

    

  
    - **status** *(string) --* 

      The status used to filter reports. You can filter using one status only.
