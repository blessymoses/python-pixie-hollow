.. py:method:: CodeBuild.Client.list_fleets(**kwargs)

  

  Gets a list of compute fleet names with each compute fleet name representing a single compute fleet.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_fleets(
        nextToken='string',
        maxResults=123,
        sortOrder='ASCENDING'|'DESCENDING',
        sortBy='NAME'|'CREATED_TIME'|'LAST_MODIFIED_TIME'
    )
    
  :type nextToken: string
  :param nextToken: 

    During a previous call, if there are more than 100 items in the list, only the first 100 items are returned, along with a unique string called a *nextToken*. To get the next batch of items in the list, call this operation again, adding the next token to the call. To get all of the items in the list, keep calling this operation with each subsequent next token that is returned, until no more next tokens are returned.

    

  
  :type maxResults: integer
  :param maxResults: 

    The maximum number of paginated compute fleets returned per response. Use ``nextToken`` to iterate pages in the list of returned compute fleets.

    

  
  :type sortOrder: string
  :param sortOrder: 

    The order in which to list compute fleets. Valid values include:

     

    
    * ``ASCENDING``: List in ascending order.
     
    * ``DESCENDING``: List in descending order.
    

     

    Use ``sortBy`` to specify the criterion to be used to list compute fleet names.

    

  
  :type sortBy: string
  :param sortBy: 

    The criterion to be used to list compute fleet names. Valid values include:

     

    
    * ``CREATED_TIME``: List based on when each compute fleet was created.
     
    * ``LAST_MODIFIED_TIME``: List based on when information about each compute fleet was last changed.
     
    * ``NAME``: List based on each compute fleet's name.
    

     

    Use ``sortOrder`` to specify in what order to list the compute fleet names based on the preceding criteria.

        If there are more than 100 items in the list, only the first 100 items are returned, along with a unique string called a *nextToken*. To get the next batch of items in the list, call this operation again, adding the next token to the call.
