      )
      
    :type reportArn: string
    :param reportArn: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The ARN of the report for which test cases are returned.

      

    
    :type sortOrder: string
    :param sortOrder: 

      Specifies if the results are sorted in ascending or descending order.

      

    
    :type sortBy: string
    :param sortBy: 

      Specifies how the results are sorted. Possible values are:

        FILE_PATH  

      The results are sorted by file path.

        LINE_COVERAGE_PERCENTAGE  

      The results are sorted by the percentage of lines that are covered.

      

    
    :type minLineCoveragePercentage: float
    :param minLineCoveragePercentage: 

      The minimum line coverage percentage to report.

      

    
    :type maxLineCoveragePercentage: float
    :param maxLineCoveragePercentage: 

      The maximum line coverage percentage to report.

      

    
    :type PaginationConfig: dict
    :param PaginationConfig: 

      A dictionary that provides parameters to control pagination.

      

    
      - **MaxItems** *(integer) --* 

        The total number of items to return. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified in max-items then a ``NextToken`` will be provided in the output that you can use to resume pagination.

        

      
      - **PageSize** *(integer) --* 

        The size of each page.

        

      
      - **StartingToken** *(string) --* 

        A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previous response.
