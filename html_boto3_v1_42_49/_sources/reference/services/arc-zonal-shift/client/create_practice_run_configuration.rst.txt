.. py:method:: ARCZonalShift.Client.create_practice_run_configuration(**kwargs)

  

  A practice run configuration for zonal autoshift is required when you enable zonal autoshift. A practice run configuration includes specifications for blocked dates and blocked time windows, and for Amazon CloudWatch alarms that you create to use with practice runs. The alarms that you specify are an *outcome alarm*, to monitor application health during practice runs and, optionally, a *blocking alarm*, to block practice runs from starting.

   

  When a resource has a practice run configuration, ARC starts zonal shifts for the resource weekly, to shift traffic for practice runs. Practice runs help you to ensure that shifting away traffic from an Availability Zone during an autoshift is safe for your application.

   

  For more information, see `Considerations when you configure zonal autoshift <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/arc-zonal-autoshift.considerations.html>`__ in the Amazon Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide.

  :type resourceIdentifier: string
  :param resourceIdentifier: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The identifier of the resource that Amazon Web Services shifts traffic for with a practice run zonal shift. The identifier is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the resource.

     

    Amazon Application Recovery Controller currently supports enabling the following resources for zonal shift and zonal autoshift:

     

    
    * `Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/arc-zonal-shift.resource-types.ec2-auto-scaling-groups.html>`__
     
    * `Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/arc-zonal-shift.resource-types.eks.html>`__
     
    * `Application Load Balancer <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/arc-zonal-shift.resource-types.app-load-balancers.html>`__
     
    * `Network Load Balancer <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/arc-zonal-shift.resource-types.network-load-balancers.html>`__
    

    

  
  :type blockedWindows: list
  :param blockedWindows: 

    Optionally, you can block ARC from starting practice runs for specific windows of days and times.

     

    The format for blocked windows is: DAY:HH:SS-DAY:HH:SS. Keep in mind, when you specify dates, that dates and times for practice runs are in UTC. Also, be aware of potential time adjustments that might be required for daylight saving time differences. Separate multiple blocked windows with spaces.

     

    For example, say you run business report summaries three days a week. For this scenario, you could set the following recurring days and times as blocked windows, for example: ``Mon:00:00-Mon:10:00 Wed-20:30-Wed:21:30 Fri-20:30-Fri:21:30``.

     

    .. warning::

       

      The ``blockedWindows`` have to start and end on the same day. Windows that span multiple days aren't supported.

      

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type blockedDates: list
  :param blockedDates: 

    Optionally, you can block ARC from starting practice runs for a resource on specific calendar dates.

     

    The format for blocked dates is: YYYY-MM-DD. Keep in mind, when you specify dates, that dates and times for practice runs are in UTC. Separate multiple blocked dates with spaces.

     

    For example, if you have an application update scheduled to launch on May 1, 2024, and you don't want practice runs to shift traffic away at that time, you could set a blocked date for ``2024-05-01``.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type blockingAlarms: list
  :param blockingAlarms: 

    *Blocking alarms* for practice runs are optional alarms that you can specify that block practice runs when one or more of the alarms is in an ``ALARM`` state.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      A control condition is an alarm that you specify for a practice run. When you configure practice runs with zonal autoshift for a resource, you specify Amazon CloudWatch alarms, which you create in CloudWatch to use with the practice run. The alarms that you specify are an *outcome alarm*, to monitor application health during practice runs and, optionally, a *blocking alarm*, to block practice runs from starting or to interrupt a practice run in progress.

       

      Control condition alarms do not apply for autoshifts.

       

      For more information, see `Considerations when you configure zonal autoshift <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/arc-zonal-autoshift.considerations.html>`__ in the Amazon Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide.

      

    
      - **type** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The type of alarm specified for a practice run. You can only specify Amazon CloudWatch alarms for practice runs, so the only valid value is ``CLOUDWATCH``.

        

      
      - **alarmIdentifier** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for an Amazon CloudWatch alarm that you specify as a control condition for a practice run.

        

      
    

  :type allowedWindows: list
  :param allowedWindows: 

    Optionally, you can allow ARC to start practice runs for specific windows of days and times.

     

    The format for allowed windows is: DAY:HH:SS-DAY:HH:SS. Keep in mind, when you specify dates, that dates and times for practice runs are in UTC. Also, be aware of potential time adjustments that might be required for daylight saving time differences. Separate multiple allowed windows with spaces.

     

    For example, say you want to allow practice runs only on Wednesdays and Fridays from noon to 5 p.m. For this scenario, you could set the following recurring days and times as allowed windows, for example: ``Wed-12:00-Wed:17:00 Fri-12:00-Fri:17:00``.

     

    .. warning::

       

      The ``allowedWindows`` have to start and end on the same day. Windows that span multiple days aren't supported.

      

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type outcomeAlarms: list
  :param outcomeAlarms: **[REQUIRED]** 

    *Outcome alarms* for practice runs are alarms that you specify that end a practice run when one or more of the alarms is in an ``ALARM`` state.

     

    Configure one or more of these alarms to monitor the health of your application when traffic is shifted away from an Availability Zone during each practice run. You should configure these alarms to go into an ``ALARM`` state if you want to stop a zonal shift, to let traffic for the resource return to the original Availability Zone.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      A control condition is an alarm that you specify for a practice run. When you configure practice runs with zonal autoshift for a resource, you specify Amazon CloudWatch alarms, which you create in CloudWatch to use with the practice run.
