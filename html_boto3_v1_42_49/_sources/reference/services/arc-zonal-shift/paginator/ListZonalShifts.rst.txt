      response_iterator = paginator.paginate(
          status='ACTIVE'|'EXPIRED'|'CANCELED',
          resourceIdentifier='string',
          PaginationConfig={
              'MaxItems': 123,
              'PageSize': 123,

          }
      )
      
    :type status: string
    :param status: 

      A status for a zonal shift.

       

      The ``Status`` for a zonal shift can have one of the following values:

       

      
      * **ACTIVE**: The zonal shift has been started and is active.
       
      * **EXPIRED**: The zonal shift has expired (the expiry time was exceeded).
       
      * **CANCELED**: The zonal shift was canceled.
      

      

    
    :type resourceIdentifier: string
    :param resourceIdentifier: 

      The identifier for the resource that you want to list zonal shifts for. The identifier is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the resource.

      

    
    :type PaginationConfig: dict
    :param PaginationConfig: 

      A dictionary that provides parameters to control pagination.

      

    
      - **MaxItems** *(integer) --* 

        The total number of items to return. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified in max-items then a ``NextToken`` will be provided in the output that you can use to resume pagination.

        

      
      - **PageSize** *(integer) --* 

        The size of each page.

        

      
      - **StartingToken** *(string) --* 

        A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previous response.

      **Response Structure**

      

      - *(dict) --* 
        

        - **items** *(list) --* 

          The items in the response list.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            Lists information about zonal shifts in Amazon Application Recovery Controller, including zonal shifts that you start yourself and zonal shifts that ARC starts on your behalf for practice runs with zonal autoshift.

             

            Zonal shifts are temporary, including customer-initiated zonal shifts and the zonal autoshift practice run zonal shifts that ARC starts weekly, on your behalf. A zonal shift that a customer starts can be active for up to three days (72 hours). A practice run zonal shift has a 30 minute duration.

            
            

            - **zonalShiftId** *(string) --* 

              The identifier of a zonal shift.

              
            

            - **resourceIdentifier** *(string) --* 

              The identifier for the resource to include in a zonal shift. The identifier is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the resource.

               

              Amazon Application Recovery Controller currently supports enabling the following resources for zonal shift and zonal autoshift:

               

              
              * `Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/arc-zonal-shift.resource-types.ec2-auto-scaling-groups.html>`__
               
              * `Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/arc-zonal-shift.resource-types.eks.html>`__
               
              * `Application Load Balancers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/arc-zonal-shift.resource-types.app-load-balancers.html>`__
               
              * `Network Load Balancers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/arc-zonal-shift.resource-types.network-load-balancers.html>`__
              

              
            

            - **awayFrom** *(string) --* 

              The Availability Zone (for example, ``use1-az1``) that traffic is moved away from for a resource when you start a zonal shift. Until the zonal shift expires or you cancel it, traffic for the resource is instead moved to other Availability Zones in the Amazon Web Services Region.

              
            

            - **expiryTime** *(datetime) --* 

              The expiry time (expiration time) for a customer-initiated zonal shift. A zonal shift is temporary and must be set to expire when you start the zonal shift. You can initially set a zonal shift to expire in a maximum of three days (72 hours). However, you can update a zonal shift to set a new expiration at any time.

               

              When you start a zonal shift, you specify how long you want it to be active, which ARC converts to an expiry time (expiration time). You can cancel a zonal shift when you're ready to restore traffic to the Availability Zone, or just wait for it to expire. Or you can update the zonal shift to specify another length of time to expire in.

              
            

            - **startTime** *(datetime) --* 

              The time (UTC) when the zonal shift starts.

              
            

            - **status** *(string) --* 

              A status for a zonal shift.

               

              The ``Status`` for a zonal shift can have one of the following values:

               

              
              * **ACTIVE:** The zonal shift has been started and is active.
               
              * **EXPIRED:** The zonal shift has expired (the expiry time was exceeded).
               
              * **CANCELED:** The zonal shift was canceled.
              

              
            

            - **comment** *(string) --* 

              A comment that you enter about the zonal shift. Only the latest comment is retained; no comment history is maintained. That is, a new comment overwrites any existing comment string.

              
            

            - **shiftType** *(string) --* 

              Defines the zonal shift type.

              
            

            - **practiceRunOutcome** *(string) --* 

              The outcome, or end state, of a practice run. The following values can be returned:

               

              
              * **PENDING:** Outcome value when the practice run is in progress.
               
              * **SUCCEEDED:** Outcome value when the outcome alarm specified for the practice run configuration does not go into an ``ALARM`` state during the practice run, and the practice run was not interrupted before it completed.
               
              * **INTERRUPTED:** Outcome value when the practice run did not run for the expected 30 minutes or there was another problem with the practice run that created an inconclusive outcome.
               
              * **FAILED:** Outcome value when the outcome alarm specified for the practice run configuration goes into an ``ALARM`` state during the practice run, and the practice run was not interrupted before it completed.
               
              * **CAPACITY_CHECK_FAILED:** The check for balanced capacity across Availability Zones for your load balancing and Auto Scaling group resources failed.
              

               

              For more information about practice run outcomes, see `Considerations when you configure zonal autoshift <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/arc-zonal-autoshift.configure.html>`__ in the Amazon Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide.

              
        
      
        

        - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

          A token to resume pagination.
