    :type submitTimeAfter: datetime
    :param submitTimeAfter: 

      Specify a time to filter for batch inference jobs that were submitted after the time you specify.

      

    
    :type submitTimeBefore: datetime
    :param submitTimeBefore: 

      Specify a time to filter for batch inference jobs that were submitted before the time you specify.

      

    
    :type statusEquals: string
    :param statusEquals: 

      Specify a status to filter for batch inference jobs whose statuses match the string you specify.

       

      The following statuses are possible:

       

      
      * Submitted – This job has been submitted to a queue for validation.
       
      * Validating – This job is being validated for the requirements described in `Format and upload your batch inference data <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/batch-inference-data.html>`__. The criteria include the following: 

        
        * Your IAM service role has access to the Amazon S3 buckets containing your files.
         
        * Your files are .jsonl files and each individual record is a JSON object in the correct format. Note that validation doesn't check if the ``modelInput`` value matches the request body for the model.
         
        * Your files fulfill the requirements for file size and number of records. For more information, see `Quotas for Amazon Bedrock <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/quotas.html>`__.
        

      
       
      * Scheduled – This job has been validated and is now in a queue. The job will automatically start when it reaches its turn.
       
      * Expired – This job timed out because it was scheduled but didn't begin before the set timeout duration. Submit a new job request.
       
      * InProgress – This job has begun. You can start viewing the results in the output S3 location.
       
      * Completed – This job has successfully completed. View the output files in the output S3 location.
       
      * PartiallyCompleted – This job has partially completed. Not all of your records could be processed in time. View the output files in the output S3 location.
       
      * Failed – This job has failed. Check the failure message for any further details. For further assistance, reach out to the `Amazon Web Services Support Center <https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home/>`__.
       
      * Stopped – This job was stopped by a user.
       
      * Stopping – This job is being stopped by a user.
      

      

    
    :type nameContains: string
    :param nameContains: 

      Specify a string to filter for batch inference jobs whose names contain the string.

      

    
    :type sortBy: string
    :param sortBy: 

      An attribute by which to sort the results.

    :type PaginationConfig: dict
    :param PaginationConfig: 

      A dictionary that provides parameters to control pagination.

      

    
      - **MaxItems** *(integer) --* 

        The total number of items to return. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified in max-items then a ``NextToken`` will be provided in the output that you can use to resume pagination.

        

      
      - **PageSize** *(integer) --* 

        The size of each page.

        

      
      - **StartingToken** *(string) --*
