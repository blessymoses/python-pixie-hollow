.. py:class:: MigrationHub.Client

  A low-level client representing AWS Migration Hub
  

  The AWS Migration Hub API methods help to obtain server and application migration status and integrate your resource-specific migration tool by providing a programmatic interface to Migration Hub.

   

  Remember that you must set your AWS Migration Hub home region before you call any of these APIs, or a ``HomeRegionNotSetException`` error will be returned. Also, you must make the API calls while in your home region.

  ::

    
    import boto3
    
    client = boto3.client('mgh')

  

These are the available methods:
