      **Response Structure**

      

      - *(dict) --* 

        Response of GetNotificationsForBudget

        
        

        - **Notifications** *(list) --* 

          A list of notifications that are associated with a budget.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            A notification that's associated with a budget. A budget can have up to ten notifications.

             

            Each notification must have at least one subscriber. A notification can have one SNS subscriber and up to 10 email subscribers, for a total of 11 subscribers.

             

            For example, if you have a budget for 200 dollars and you want to be notified when you go over 160 dollars, create a notification with the following parameters:

             

            
            * A notificationType of ``ACTUAL``
             
            * A ``thresholdType`` of ``PERCENTAGE``
             
            * A ``comparisonOperator`` of ``GREATER_THAN``
             
            * A notification ``threshold`` of ``80``
            

            
            

            - **NotificationType** *(string) --* 

              Specifies whether the notification is for how much you have spent ( ``ACTUAL``) or for how much that you're forecasted to spend ( ``FORECASTED``).

              
            

            - **ComparisonOperator** *(string) --* 

              The comparison that's used for this notification.

              
            

            - **Threshold** *(float) --* 

              The threshold that's associated with a notification. Thresholds are always a percentage, and many customers find value being alerted between 50% - 200% of the budgeted amount. The maximum limit for your threshold is 1,000,000% above the budgeted amount.

              
            

            - **ThresholdType** *(string) --* 

              The type of threshold for a notification. For ``ABSOLUTE_VALUE`` thresholds, Amazon Web Services notifies you when you go over or are forecasted to go over your total cost threshold. For ``PERCENTAGE`` thresholds, Amazon Web Services notifies you when you go over or are forecasted to go over a certain percentage of your forecasted spend. For example, if you have a budget for 200 dollars and you have a ``PERCENTAGE`` threshold of 80%, Amazon Web Services notifies you when you go over 160 dollars.

              
            

            - **NotificationState** *(string) --* 

              Specifies whether this notification is in alarm. If a budget notification is in the ``ALARM`` state, you passed the set threshold for the budget.
