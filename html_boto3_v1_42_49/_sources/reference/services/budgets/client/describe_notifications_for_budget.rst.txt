    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 

      Response of GetNotificationsForBudget

      
      

      - **Notifications** *(list) --* 

        A list of notifications that are associated with a budget.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          A notification that's associated with a budget. A budget can have up to ten notifications.

           

          Each notification must have at least one subscriber. A notification can have one SNS subscriber and up to 10 email subscribers, for a total of 11 subscribers.

           

          For example, if you have a budget for 200 dollars and you want to be notified when you go over 160 dollars, create a notification with the following parameters:

           

          
          * A notificationType of ``ACTUAL``
           
          * A ``thresholdType`` of ``PERCENTAGE``
           
          * A ``comparisonOperator`` of ``GREATER_THAN``
           
          * A notification ``threshold`` of ``80``
          

          
          

          - **NotificationType** *(string) --* 

            Specifies whether the notification is for how much you have spent ( ``ACTUAL``) or for how much that you're forecasted to spend ( ``FORECASTED``).

            
          

          - **ComparisonOperator** *(string) --* 

            The comparison that's used for this notification.

            
          

          - **Threshold** *(float) --* 

            The threshold that's associated with a notification. Thresholds are always a percentage, and many customers find value being alerted between 50% - 200% of the budgeted amount. The maximum limit for your threshold is 1,000,000% above the budgeted amount.

            
          

          - **ThresholdType** *(string) --* 

            The type of threshold for a notification. For ``ABSOLUTE_VALUE`` thresholds, Amazon Web Services notifies you when you go over or are forecasted to go over your total cost threshold. For ``PERCENTAGE`` thresholds, Amazon Web Services notifies you when you go over or are forecasted to go over a certain percentage of your forecasted spend. For example, if you have a budget for 200 dollars and you have a ``PERCENTAGE`` threshold of 80%, Amazon Web Services notifies you when you go over 160 dollars.

            
          

          - **NotificationState** *(string) --* 

            Specifies whether this notification is in alarm. If a budget notification is in the ``ALARM`` state, you passed the set threshold for the budget.

            
      
    
      

      - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

        The pagination token in the service response that indicates the next set of results that you can retrieve.
