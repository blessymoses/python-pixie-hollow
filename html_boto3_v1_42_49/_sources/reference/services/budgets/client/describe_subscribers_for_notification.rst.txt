  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.describe_subscribers_for_notification(
        AccountId='string',
        BudgetName='string',
        Notification={
            'NotificationType': 'ACTUAL'|'FORECASTED',
            'ComparisonOperator': 'GREATER_THAN'|'LESS_THAN'|'EQUAL_TO',
            'Threshold': 123.0,
            'ThresholdType': 'PERCENTAGE'|'ABSOLUTE_VALUE',
            'NotificationState': 'OK'|'ALARM'
        },
        MaxResults=123,
        NextToken='string'
    )
    
  :type AccountId: string
  :param AccountId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ``accountId`` that is associated with the budget whose subscribers you want descriptions of.

    

  
  :type BudgetName: string
  :param BudgetName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of the budget whose subscribers you want descriptions of.

    

  
  :type Notification: dict
  :param Notification: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The notification whose subscribers you want to list.

    

  
    - **NotificationType** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      Specifies whether the notification is for how much you have spent ( ``ACTUAL``) or for how much that you're forecasted to spend ( ``FORECASTED``).

      

    
    - **ComparisonOperator** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The comparison that's used for this notification.

      

    
    - **Threshold** *(float) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The threshold that's associated with a notification. Thresholds are always a percentage, and many customers find value being alerted between 50% - 200% of the budgeted amount. The maximum limit for your threshold is 1,000,000% above the budgeted amount.

      

    
    - **ThresholdType** *(string) --* 

      The type of threshold for a notification. For ``ABSOLUTE_VALUE`` thresholds, Amazon Web Services notifies you when you go over or are forecasted to go over your total cost threshold. For ``PERCENTAGE`` thresholds, Amazon Web Services notifies you when you go over or are forecasted to go over a certain percentage of your forecasted spend. For example, if you have a budget for 200 dollars and you have a ``PERCENTAGE`` threshold of 80%, Amazon Web Services notifies you when you go over 160 dollars.

      

    
    - **NotificationState** *(string) --* 

      Specifies whether this notification is in alarm. If a budget notification is in the ``ALARM`` state, you passed the set threshold for the budget.

      

    
  
  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    An optional integer that represents how many entries a paginated response contains.

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    The pagination token that you include in your request to indicate the next set of results that you want to retrieve.

      Response of DescribeSubscribersForNotification

          The subscriber to a budget notification. The subscriber consists of a subscription type and either an Amazon SNS topic or an email address.

           

          For example, an email subscriber has the following parameters:

           

          
          * A ``subscriptionType`` of ``EMAIL``
           
          * An ``address`` of ``example@example.com``

            The type of notification that Amazon Web Services sends to a subscriber.

            
          

          - **Address** *(string) --* 

            The address that Amazon Web Services sends budget notifications to, either an SNS topic or an email.

             

            When you create a subscriber, the value of ``Address`` can't contain line breaks.
