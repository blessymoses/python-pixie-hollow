            },
        ]
    )
    
  :type AccountId: string
  :param AccountId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ``accountId`` that is associated with the budget that you want to create a notification for.

    

  
  :type BudgetName: string
  :param BudgetName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of the budget that you want Amazon Web Services to notify you about. Budget names must be unique within an account.

    

  
  :type Notification: dict
  :param Notification: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The notification that you want to create.

    

  
    - **NotificationType** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      Specifies whether the notification is for how much you have spent ( ``ACTUAL``) or for how much that you're forecasted to spend ( ``FORECASTED``).

      

    
    - **ComparisonOperator** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The comparison that's used for this notification.

      

    
    - **Threshold** *(float) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The threshold that's associated with a notification. Thresholds are always a percentage, and many customers find value being alerted between 50% - 200% of the budgeted amount. The maximum limit for your threshold is 1,000,000% above the budgeted amount.

      

    
    - **ThresholdType** *(string) --* 

      The type of threshold for a notification. For ``ABSOLUTE_VALUE`` thresholds, Amazon Web Services notifies you when you go over or are forecasted to go over your total cost threshold. For ``PERCENTAGE`` thresholds, Amazon Web Services notifies you when you go over or are forecasted to go over a certain percentage of your forecasted spend. For example, if you have a budget for 200 dollars and you have a ``PERCENTAGE`` threshold of 80%, Amazon Web Services notifies you when you go over 160 dollars.

      

    
    - **NotificationState** *(string) --* 

      Specifies whether this notification is in alarm. If a budget notification is in the ``ALARM`` state, you passed the set threshold for the budget.

      

    
  
  :type Subscribers: list
  :param Subscribers: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A list of subscribers that you want to associate with the notification. Each notification can have one SNS subscriber and up to 10 email subscribers.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      The subscriber to a budget notification. The subscriber consists of a subscription type and either an Amazon SNS topic or an email address.

       

      For example, an email subscriber has the following parameters:

       

      
      * A ``subscriptionType`` of ``EMAIL``
       
      * An ``address`` of ``example@example.com``
      

      

    
      - **SubscriptionType** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The type of notification that Amazon Web Services sends to a subscriber.

        

      
      - **Address** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The address that Amazon Web Services sends budget notifications to, either an SNS topic or an email.

         

        When you create a subscriber, the value of ``Address`` can't contain line breaks.
