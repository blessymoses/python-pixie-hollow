  :type AccountId: string
  :param AccountId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ``accountId`` that is associated with the budget whose notification you want to update.

    

  
  :type BudgetName: string
  :param BudgetName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of the budget whose notification you want to update.

    

  
  :type OldNotification: dict
  :param OldNotification: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The previous notification that is associated with a budget.

    

  
    - **NotificationType** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      Specifies whether the notification is for how much you have spent ( ``ACTUAL``) or for how much that you're forecasted to spend ( ``FORECASTED``).

      

    
    - **ComparisonOperator** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The comparison that's used for this notification.

      

    
    - **Threshold** *(float) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The threshold that's associated with a notification. Thresholds are always a percentage, and many customers find value being alerted between 50% - 200% of the budgeted amount. The maximum limit for your threshold is 1,000,000% above the budgeted amount.

      

    
    - **ThresholdType** *(string) --* 

      The type of threshold for a notification. For ``ABSOLUTE_VALUE`` thresholds, Amazon Web Services notifies you when you go over or are forecasted to go over your total cost threshold. For ``PERCENTAGE`` thresholds, Amazon Web Services notifies you when you go over or are forecasted to go over a certain percentage of your forecasted spend. For example, if you have a budget for 200 dollars and you have a ``PERCENTAGE`` threshold of 80%, Amazon Web Services notifies you when you go over 160 dollars.

      

    
    - **NotificationState** *(string) --*
