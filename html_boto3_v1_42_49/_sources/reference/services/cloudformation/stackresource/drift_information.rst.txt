  - *(dict) --* 

    Information about whether the resource's actual configuration differs, or has *drifted*, from its expected configuration, as defined in the stack template and any values specified as template parameters. For more information, see `Detect unmanaged configuration changes to stacks and resources with drift detection <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-stack-drift.html>`__.

    
    

    - **StackResourceDriftStatus** *(string) --* 

      Status of the resource's actual configuration compared to its expected configuration

       

      
      * ``DELETED``: The resource differs from its expected configuration in that it has been deleted.
       
      * ``MODIFIED``: The resource differs from its expected configuration.
       
      * ``NOT_CHECKED``: CloudFormation has not checked if the resource differs from its expected configuration. Any resources that do not currently support drift detection have a status of ``NOT_CHECKED``. For more information, see `Resource type support for imports and drift detection <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/resource-import-supported-resources.html>`__.
       
      * ``IN_SYNC``: The resource's actual configuration matches its expected configuration.
      

      
    

    - **LastCheckTimestamp** *(datetime) --*
