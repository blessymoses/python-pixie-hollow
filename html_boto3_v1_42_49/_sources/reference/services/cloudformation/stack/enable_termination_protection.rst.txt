  - *(boolean) --* 

    Whether termination protection is enabled for the stack.

     

    For `nested stacks <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-nested-stacks.html>`__, termination protection is set on the root stack and can't be changed directly on the nested stack. For more information, see `Protect a CloudFormation stack from being deleted <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-protect-stacks.html>`__ in the *CloudFormation User Guide*.
