  - *(dict) --* 

    Information about whether a stack's actual configuration differs, or has *drifted*, from its expected configuration, as defined in the stack template and any values specified as template parameters. For more information, see `Detect unmanaged configuration changes to stacks and resources with drift detection <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-stack-drift.html>`__.

    
    

    - **StackDriftStatus** *(string) --* 

      Status of the stack's actual configuration compared to its expected template configuration.

       

      
      * ``DRIFTED``: The stack differs from its expected template configuration. A stack is considered to have drifted if one or more of its resources have drifted.
       
      * ``NOT_CHECKED``: CloudFormation hasn't checked if the stack differs from its expected template configuration.
       
      * ``IN_SYNC``: The stack's actual configuration matches its expected template configuration.
       
      * ``UNKNOWN``: CloudFormation could not run drift detection for a resource in the stack.
      

      
    

    - **LastCheckTimestamp** *(datetime) --* 

      Most recent time when a drift detection operation was initiated on the stack, or any of its individual resources that support drift detection.
