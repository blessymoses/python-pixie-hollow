    **Request Syntax**
    ::

      waiter.wait(
          StackName='string',
          NextToken='string',
          WaiterConfig={
              'Delay': 123,
              'MaxAttempts': 123
          }
      )
      
    :type StackName: string
    :param StackName: 

      .. note::

        

        If you don't pass a parameter to ``StackName``, the API returns a response that describes all resources in the account, which can impact performance. This requires ``ListStacks`` and ``DescribeStacks`` permissions.

         

        Consider using the  ListStacks API if you're not passing a parameter to ``StackName``.

         

        The IAM policy below can be added to IAM policies when you want to limit resource-level permissions and avoid returning a response when no parameter is sent in the request:

         

        { "Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": [{ "Effect": "Deny", "Action": "cloudformation:DescribeStacks", "NotResource": "arn:aws:cloudformation:*:*:stack/*/*" }] }

        

       

      The name or the unique stack ID that's associated with the stack, which aren't always interchangeable:

       

      
      * Running stacks: You can specify either the stack's name or its unique stack ID.
       
      * Deleted stacks: You must specify the unique stack ID.
      

      

    
    :type NextToken: string
    :param NextToken: 

      The token for the next set of items to return. (You received this token from a previous call.)

      

    
    :type WaiterConfig: dict
    :param WaiterConfig: 

      A dictionary that provides parameters to control waiting behavior.

      

    
      - **Delay** *(integer) --* 

        The amount of time in seconds to wait between attempts. Default: 30

        

      
      - **MaxAttempts** *(integer) --* 

        The maximum number of attempts to be made. Default: 120

        

      
    
    
    :returns: None
