.. py:attribute:: CloudFormation.StackResourceSummary.drift_information

  

  - *(dict) --* 

    Information about whether the resource's actual configuration differs, or has *drifted*, from its expected configuration, as defined in the stack template and any values specified as template parameters. For more information, see `Detect unmanaged configuration changes to stacks and resources with drift detection <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-stack-drift.html>`__.

    
    

    - **StackResourceDriftStatus** *(string) --* 

      Status of the resource's actual configuration compared to its expected configuration.

       

      
      * ``DELETED``: The resource differs from its expected configuration in that it has been deleted.
       
      * ``MODIFIED``: The resource differs from its expected configuration.
       
      * ``NOT_CHECKED``: CloudFormation hasn't checked if the resource differs from its expected configuration. Any resources that don't currently support drift detection have a status of ``NOT_CHECKED``. For more information, see `Resource type support for imports and drift detection <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/resource-import-supported-resources.html>`__. If you performed an  ContinueUpdateRollback operation on a stack, any resources included in ``ResourcesToSkip`` will also have a status of ``NOT_CHECKED``. For more information about skipping resources during rollback operations, see `Continue rolling back an update <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-continueupdaterollback.html>`__ in the *CloudFormation User Guide*.
       
      * ``IN_SYNC``: The resource's actual configuration matches its expected configuration.
      

      
    

    - **LastCheckTimestamp** *(datetime) --* 

      When CloudFormation last checked if the resource had drifted from its expected configuration.
