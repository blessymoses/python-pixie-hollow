.. py:attribute:: CloudFormation.Event.client_request_token

  

  - *(string) --* 

    The token passed to the operation that generated this event.

     

    All events triggered by a given stack operation are assigned the same client request token, which you can use to track operations. For example, if you execute a ``CreateStack`` operation with the token ``token1``, then all the ``StackEvents`` generated by that operation will have ``ClientRequestToken`` set as ``token1``.

     

    In the console, stack operations display the client request token on the Events tab. Stack operations that are initiated from the console use the token format *Console-StackOperation-ID*, which helps you easily identify the stack operation . For example, if you create a stack using the console, each stack event would be assigned the same token in the following format: ``Console-CreateStack-7f59c3cf-00d2-40c7-b2ff-e75db0987002``.
