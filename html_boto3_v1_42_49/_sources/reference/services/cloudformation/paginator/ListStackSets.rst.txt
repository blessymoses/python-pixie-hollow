          }
      )
      
    :type Status: string
    :param Status: 

      The status of the StackSets that you want to get summary information about.

      

    
    :type CallAs: string
    :param CallAs: 

      [Service-managed permissions] Specifies whether you are acting as an account administrator in the management account or as a delegated administrator in a member account.

       

      By default, ``SELF`` is specified. Use ``SELF`` for StackSets with self-managed permissions.

       

      
      * If you are signed in to the management account, specify ``SELF``.
       
      * If you are signed in to a delegated administrator account, specify ``DELEGATED_ADMIN``. Your Amazon Web Services account must be registered as a delegated administrator in the management account. For more information, see `Register a delegated administrator <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-orgs-delegated-admin.html>`__ in the *CloudFormation User Guide*.
      

      

    
    :type PaginationConfig: dict
    :param PaginationConfig: 

      A dictionary that provides parameters to control pagination.

      

    
      - **MaxItems** *(integer) --* 

        The total number of items to return. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified in max-items then a ``NextToken`` will be provided in the output that you can use to resume pagination.

        

      
      - **PageSize** *(integer) --* 

        The size of each page.

        

      
      - **StartingToken** *(string) --* 

        A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previous response.

      **Response Structure**

      

      - *(dict) --* 
        

        - **Summaries** *(list) --* 

          A list of ``StackSetSummary`` structures that contain information about the user's StackSets.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            The structures that contain summary information about the specified StackSet.

            
            

            - **StackSetName** *(string) --* 

              The name of the StackSet.

              
            

            - **StackSetId** *(string) --* 

              The ID of the StackSet.

              
            

            - **Description** *(string) --* 

              A description of the StackSet that you specify when the StackSet is created or updated.

              
            

            - **Status** *(string) --* 

              The status of the StackSet.

              
            

            - **AutoDeployment** *(dict) --* 

              [Service-managed permissions] Describes whether StackSets automatically deploys to Organizations accounts that are added to a target organizational unit (OU).

              
              

              - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

                If set to ``true``, StackSets automatically deploys additional stack instances to Organizations accounts that are added to a target organization or organizational unit (OU) in the specified Regions. If an account is removed from a target organization or OU, StackSets deletes stack instances from the account in the specified Regions.

                
              

              - **RetainStacksOnAccountRemoval** *(boolean) --* 

                If set to ``true``, stack resources are retained when an account is removed from a target organization or OU. If set to ``false``, stack resources are deleted. Specify only if ``Enabled`` is set to ``True``.

                
              

              - **DependsOn** *(list) --* 

                A list of StackSet ARNs that this StackSet depends on for auto-deployment operations. When auto-deployment is triggered, operations will be sequenced to ensure all dependencies complete successfully before this StackSet's operation begins.

                
                

                - *(string) --* 
            
          
            

            - **PermissionModel** *(string) --* 

              Describes how the IAM roles required for StackSet operations are created.

               

              
              * With ``self-managed`` permissions, you must create the administrator and execution roles required to deploy to target accounts. For more information, see `Grant self-managed permissions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-prereqs-self-managed.html>`__.
               
              * With ``service-managed`` permissions, StackSets automatically creates the IAM roles required to deploy to accounts managed by Organizations. For more information, see `Activate trusted access for StackSets with Organizations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-orgs-activate-trusted-access.html>`__.
              

              
            

            - **DriftStatus** *(string) --* 

              Status of the StackSet's actual configuration compared to its expected template and parameter configuration.

               

              
              * ``DRIFTED``: One or more of the stack instances belonging to the StackSet differs from the expected template and parameter configuration. A stack instance is considered to have drifted if one or more of the resources in the associated stack have drifted.
               
              * ``NOT_CHECKED``: CloudFormation hasn't checked the StackSet for drift.
               
              * ``IN_SYNC``: All the stack instances belonging to the StackSet match the expected template and parameter configuration.
               
              * ``UNKNOWN``: This value is reserved for future use.
              

              
            

            - **LastDriftCheckTimestamp** *(datetime) --* 

              Most recent time when CloudFormation performed a drift detection operation on the StackSet. This value will be ``NULL`` for any StackSet that drift detection hasn't yet been performed on.

              
            

            - **ManagedExecution** *(dict) --* 

              Describes whether StackSets performs non-conflicting operations concurrently and queues conflicting operations.

              
              

              - **Active** *(boolean) --* 

                When ``true``, CloudFormation performs non-conflicting operations concurrently and queues conflicting operations. After conflicting operations finish, CloudFormation starts queued operations in request order.

                 

                .. note::

                  

                  If there are already running or queued operations, CloudFormation queues all incoming operations even if they are non-conflicting.

                   

                  You can't modify your StackSet's execution configuration while there are running or queued operations for that StackSet.

                  

                 

                When ``false`` (default), StackSets performs one operation at a time in request order.
