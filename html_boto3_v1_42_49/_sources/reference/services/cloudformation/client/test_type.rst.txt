.. py:method:: CloudFormation.Client.test_type(**kwargs)

  

  Tests a registered extension to make sure it meets all necessary requirements for being published in the CloudFormation registry.

   

  
  * For resource types, this includes passing all contracts tests defined for the type.
   
  * For modules, this includes determining if the module's model meets all necessary requirements.
  

   

  For more information, see `Testing your public extension before publishing <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation-cli/latest/userguide/publish-extension.html#publish-extension-testing>`__ in the *CloudFormation Command Line Interface (CLI) User Guide*.

   

  If you don't specify a version, CloudFormation uses the default version of the extension in your account and Region for testing.

   

  To perform testing, CloudFormation assumes the execution role specified when the type was registered. For more information, see `RegisterType <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_RegisterType.html>`__.

   

  Once you've initiated testing on an extension using ``TestType``, you can pass the returned ``TypeVersionArn`` into `DescribeType <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeType.html>`__ to monitor the current test status and test status description for the extension.

   

  An extension must have a test status of ``PASSED`` before it can be published. For more information, see `Publishing extensions to make them available for public use <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation-cli/latest/userguide/resource-type-publish.html>`__ in the *CloudFormation Command Line Interface (CLI) User Guide*.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.test_type(
        Arn='string',
        Type='RESOURCE'|'MODULE'|'HOOK',
        TypeName='string',
        VersionId='string',
        LogDeliveryBucket='string'
    )
    
  :type Arn: string
  :param Arn: 

    The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the extension.

     

    Conditional: You must specify ``Arn``, or ``TypeName`` and ``Type``.

    

  
  :type Type: string
  :param Type: 

    The type of the extension to test.

     

    Conditional: You must specify ``Arn``, or ``TypeName`` and ``Type``.

    

  
  :type TypeName: string
  :param TypeName: 

    The name of the extension to test.

     

    Conditional: You must specify ``Arn``, or ``TypeName`` and ``Type``.

    

  
  :type VersionId: string
  :param VersionId: 

    The version of the extension to test.

     

    You can specify the version id with either ``Arn``, or with ``TypeName`` and ``Type``.

     

    If you don't specify a version, CloudFormation uses the default version of the extension in this account and Region for testing.

    

  
  :type LogDeliveryBucket: string
  :param LogDeliveryBucket: 

    The S3 bucket to which CloudFormation delivers the contract test execution logs.

     

    CloudFormation delivers the logs by the time contract testing has completed and the extension has been assigned a test type status of ``PASSED`` or ``FAILED``.

     

    The user calling ``TestType`` must be able to access items in the specified S3 bucket. Specifically, the user needs the following permissions:

     

    
    * ``GetObject``
     
    * ``PutObject``
    

     

    For more information, see `Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for Amazon S3 <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_amazons3.html>`__ in the *Identity and Access Management User Guide*.
