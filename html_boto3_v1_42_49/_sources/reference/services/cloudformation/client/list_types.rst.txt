        MaxResults=123,
        NextToken='string'
    )
    
  :type Visibility: string
  :param Visibility: 

    The scope at which the extensions are visible and usable in CloudFormation operations.

     

    Valid values include:

     

    
    * ``PRIVATE``: Extensions that are visible and usable within this account and Region. This includes: 

      
      * Private extensions you have registered in this account and Region.
       
      * Public extensions that you have activated in this account and Region.
      

    
     
    * ``PUBLIC``: Extensions that are publicly visible and available to be activated within any Amazon Web Services account. This includes extensions from Amazon Web Services and third-party publishers.
    

     

    The default is ``PRIVATE``.

    

  
  :type ProvisioningType: string
  :param ProvisioningType: 

    For resource types, the provisioning behavior of the resource type. CloudFormation determines the provisioning type during registration, based on the types of handlers in the schema handler package submitted.

     

    Valid values include:

     

    
    * ``FULLY_MUTABLE``: The resource type includes an update handler to process updates to the type during stack update operations.
     
    * ``IMMUTABLE``: The resource type doesn't include an update handler, so the type can't be updated and must instead be replaced during stack update operations.
     
    * ``NON_PROVISIONABLE``: The resource type doesn't include create, read, and delete handlers, and therefore can't actually be provisioned.
    

     

    The default is ``FULLY_MUTABLE``.

    

  
  :type DeprecatedStatus: string
  :param DeprecatedStatus: 

    The deprecation status of the extension that you want to get summary information about.

     

    Valid values include:

     

    
    * ``LIVE``: The extension is registered for use in CloudFormation operations.
     
    * ``DEPRECATED``: The extension has been deregistered and can no longer be used in CloudFormation operations.
    

    

  
  :type Type: string
  :param Type: 

    The type of extension.

    

  
  :type Filters: dict
  :param Filters: 

    Filter criteria to use in determining which extensions to return.

     

    Filters must be compatible with ``Visibility`` to return valid results. For example, specifying ``AWS_TYPES`` for ``Category`` and ``PRIVATE`` for ``Visibility`` returns an empty list of types, but specifying ``PUBLIC`` for ``Visibility`` returns the desired list.

    

  
    - **Category** *(string) --* 

      The category of extensions to return.

       

      
      * ``REGISTERED``: Private extensions that have been registered for this account and Region.
       
      * ``ACTIVATED``: Public extensions that have been activated for this account and Region.
       
      * ``THIRD_PARTY``: Extensions available for use from publishers other than Amazon. This includes: 

        
        * Private extensions registered in the account.
         
        * Public extensions from publishers other than Amazon, whether activated or not.
        

      
       
      * ``AWS_TYPES``: Extensions available for use from Amazon.
      

      

    
    - **PublisherId** *(string) --* 

      The id of the publisher of the extension.

       

      Extensions published by Amazon aren't assigned a publisher ID. Use the ``AWS_TYPES`` category to specify a list of types published by Amazon.

      

    
    - **TypeNamePrefix** *(string) --* 

      A prefix to use as a filter for results.

      

    
  
  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    The maximum number of results to be returned with a single call. If the number of available results exceeds this maximum, the response includes a ``NextToken`` value that you can assign to the ``NextToken`` request parameter to get the next set of results.

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    The token for the next set of items to return. (You received this token from a previous call.)

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **TypeSummaries** *(list) --* 

        A list of ``TypeSummary`` structures that contain information about the specified extensions.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          Contains summary information about the specified CloudFormation extension.

          
          

          - **Type** *(string) --* 

            The kind of extension.

            
          

          - **TypeName** *(string) --* 

            The name of the extension.

             

            If you specified a ``TypeNameAlias`` when you call the `ActivateType <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_ActivateType.html>`__ API operation in your account and Region, CloudFormation considers that alias as the type name.

            
          

          - **DefaultVersionId** *(string) --* 

            The ID of the default version of the extension. The default version is used when the extension version isn't specified.

             

            This applies only to private extensions you have registered in your account. For public extensions, both those provided by Amazon and published by third parties, CloudFormation returns ``null``. For more information, see `RegisterType <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_RegisterType.html>`__.

             

            To set the default version of an extension, use  SetTypeDefaultVersion.

            
          

          - **TypeArn** *(string) --* 

            The ARN of the extension.

            
          

          - **LastUpdated** *(datetime) --* 

            When the specified extension version was registered. This applies only to:

             

            
            * Private extensions you have registered in your account. For more information, see `RegisterType <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_RegisterType.html>`__.
             
            * Public extensions you have activated in your account with auto-update specified. For more information, see `ActivateType <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_ActivateType.html>`__.
            

             

            For all other extension types, CloudFormation returns ``null``.

            
          

          - **Description** *(string) --* 

            The description of the extension.

            
          

          - **PublisherId** *(string) --* 

            The ID of the extension publisher, if the extension is published by a third party. Extensions published by Amazon don't return a publisher ID.

            
          

          - **OriginalTypeName** *(string) --* 

            For public extensions that have been activated for this account and Region, the type name of the public extension.

             

            If you specified a ``TypeNameAlias`` when enabling the extension in this account and Region, CloudFormation treats that alias as the extension's type name within the account and Region, not the type name of the public extension. For more information, see `Use aliases to refer to extensions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/registry-public.html#registry-public-enable-alias>`__ in the *CloudFormation User Guide*.

            
          

          - **PublicVersionNumber** *(string) --* 

            For public extensions that have been activated for this account and Region, the version of the public extension to be used for CloudFormation operations in this account and Region.

             

            How you specified ``AutoUpdate`` when enabling the extension affects whether CloudFormation automatically updates the extension in this account and Region when a new version is released. For more information, see `Automatically use new versions of extensions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/registry-public.html#registry-public-enable-auto>`__ in the *CloudFormation User Guide*.

            
          

          - **LatestPublicVersion** *(string) --* 

            For public extensions that have been activated for this account and Region, the latest version of the public extension *that is available*. For any extensions other than activated third-party extensions, CloudFormation returns ``null``.

             

            How you specified ``AutoUpdate`` when enabling the extension affects whether CloudFormation automatically updates the extension in this account and Region when a new version is released. For more information, see `Automatically use new versions of extensions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/registry-public.html#registry-public-enable-auto>`__ in the *CloudFormation User Guide*.

            
          

          - **PublisherIdentity** *(string) --* 

            The service used to verify the publisher identity.

             

            For more information, see `Publishing extensions to make them available for public use <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation-cli/latest/userguide/publish-extension.html>`__ in the *CloudFormation Command Line Interface (CLI) User Guide*.

            
          

          - **PublisherName** *(string) --* 

            The publisher name, as defined in the public profile for that publisher in the service used to verify the publisher identity.

            
          

          - **IsActivated** *(boolean) --* 

            Whether the extension is activated for this account and Region.

             

            This applies only to third-party public extensions. Extensions published by Amazon are activated by default.

            
      
    
      

      - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

        If the request doesn't return all the remaining results, ``NextToken`` is set to a token. To retrieve the next set of results, call this action again and assign that token to the request object's ``NextToken`` parameter. If the request returns all results, ``NextToken`` is set to ``null``.
