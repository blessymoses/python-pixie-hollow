  Returns summary information about the results of a StackSet operation.

   

  .. note::

    

    This API provides *eventually consistent* reads meaning it may take some time but will eventually return the most up-to-date data.

        OperationId='string',
        NextToken='string',
        MaxResults=123,

                'Name': 'OPERATION_RESULT_STATUS',
                'Values': 'string'
            },
        ]
    )
    
  :type StackSetName: string
  :param StackSetName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name or unique ID of the StackSet that you want to get operation results for.

    

  
  :type OperationId: string
  :param OperationId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ID of the StackSet operation.

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    The token for the next set of items to return. (You received this token from a previous call.)

    

  
  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    The maximum number of results to be returned with a single call. If the number of available results exceeds this maximum, the response includes a ``NextToken`` value that you can assign to the ``NextToken`` request parameter to get the next set of results.

    

  
  :type CallAs: string
  :param CallAs: 

    [Service-managed permissions] Specifies whether you are acting as an account administrator in the organization's management account or as a delegated administrator in a member account.

     

    By default, ``SELF`` is specified. Use ``SELF`` for StackSets with self-managed permissions.

     

    
    * If you are signed in to the management account, specify ``SELF``.
     
    * If you are signed in to a delegated administrator account, specify ``DELEGATED_ADMIN``. Your Amazon Web Services account must be registered as a delegated administrator in the management account. For more information, see `Register a delegated administrator <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-orgs-delegated-admin.html>`__ in the *CloudFormation User Guide*.
    

    

  
  :type Filters: list
  :param Filters: 

    The filter to apply to operation results.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      The status that operation results are filtered by.

      

    
      - **Name** *(string) --* 

        The type of filter to apply.

        

      
      - **Values** *(string) --*

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **Summaries** *(list) --* 

        A list of ``StackSetOperationResultSummary`` structures that contain information about the specified operation results, for accounts and Amazon Web Services Regions that are included in the operation.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          The structure that contains information about a specified operation's results for a given account in a given Region.

          
          

          - **Account** *(string) --* 

            [Self-managed permissions] The name of the Amazon Web Services account for this operation result.

            
          

          - **Region** *(string) --* 

            The name of the Amazon Web Services Region for this operation result.

            
          

          - **Status** *(string) --* 

            The result status of the StackSet operation for the given account in the given Region.

             

            
            * ``CANCELLED``: The operation in the specified account and Region has been canceled. This is either because a user has stopped the StackSet operation, or because the failure tolerance of the StackSet operation has been exceeded.
             
            * ``FAILED``: The operation in the specified account and Region failed. If the StackSet operation fails in enough accounts within a Region, the failure tolerance for the StackSet operation as a whole might be exceeded.
             
            * ``RUNNING``: The operation in the specified account and Region is currently in progress.
             
            * ``PENDING``: The operation in the specified account and Region has yet to start.
             
            * ``SUCCEEDED``: The operation in the specified account and Region completed successfully.
            

            
          

          - **StatusReason** *(string) --* 

            The reason for the assigned result status.

            
          

          - **AccountGateResult** *(dict) --* 

            The results of the account gate function CloudFormation invokes, if present, before proceeding with StackSet operations in an account.

            
            

            - **Status** *(string) --* 

              The status of the account gate function.

               

              
              * ``SUCCEEDED``: The account gate function has determined that the account and Region passes any requirements for a StackSet operation to occur. CloudFormation proceeds with the stack operation in that account and Region.
               
              * ``FAILED``: The account gate function has determined that the account and Region doesn't meet the requirements for a StackSet operation to occur. CloudFormation cancels the StackSet operation in that account and Region, and sets the StackSet operation result status for that account and Region to ``FAILED``.
               
              * ``SKIPPED``: CloudFormation has skipped calling the account gate function for this account and Region, for one of the following reasons: 

                
                * An account gate function hasn't been specified for the account and Region. CloudFormation proceeds with the StackSet operation in this account and Region.
                 
                * The ``AWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole`` of the administration account lacks permissions to invoke the function. CloudFormation proceeds with the StackSet operation in this account and Region.
                 
                * Either no action is necessary, or no action is possible, on the stack. CloudFormation skips the StackSet operation in this account and Region.
                

              
              

              
            

            - **StatusReason** *(string) --* 

              The reason for the account gate status assigned to this account and Region for the StackSet operation.

              
        
          

          - **OrganizationalUnitId** *(string) --* 

            [Service-managed permissions] The organization root ID or organizational unit (OU) IDs that you specified for `DeploymentTargets <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_DeploymentTargets.html>`__.

            
      
    
      

      - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

        If the request doesn't return all results, ``NextToken`` is set to a token. To retrieve the next set of results, call ``ListOperationResults`` again and assign that token to the request object's ``NextToken`` parameter. If there are no remaining results, ``NextToken`` is set to ``null``.
