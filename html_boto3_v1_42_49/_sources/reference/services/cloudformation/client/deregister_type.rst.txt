.. py:method:: CloudFormation.Client.deregister_type(**kwargs)

  

  Marks an extension or extension version as ``DEPRECATED`` in the CloudFormation registry, removing it from active use. Deprecated extensions or extension versions cannot be used in CloudFormation operations.

   

  To deregister an entire extension, you must individually deregister all active versions of that extension. If an extension has only a single active version, deregistering that version results in the extension itself being deregistered and marked as deprecated in the registry.

   

  You can't deregister the default version of an extension if there are other active version of that extension. If you do deregister the default version of an extension, the extension type itself is deregistered as well and marked as deprecated.

   

  To view the deprecation status of an extension or extension version, use `DescribeType <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeType.html>`__.

   

  For more information, see `Remove third-party private extensions from your account <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/registry-private-deregister-extension.html>`__ in the *CloudFormation User Guide*.
