.. py:method:: CloudFormation.Client.execute_change_set(**kwargs)

  

  Updates a stack using the input information that was provided when the specified change set was created. After the call successfully completes, CloudFormation starts updating the stack. Use the  DescribeStacks action to view the status of the update.

   

  When you execute a change set, CloudFormation deletes all other change sets associated with the stack because they aren't valid for the updated stack.

   

  If a stack policy is associated with the stack, CloudFormation enforces the policy during the update. You can't specify a temporary stack policy that overrides the current policy.

   

  To create a change set for the entire stack hierarchy, ``IncludeNestedStacks`` must have been set to ``True``.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.execute_change_set(
        ChangeSetName='string',
        StackName='string',
        ClientRequestToken='string',
        DisableRollback=True|False,
        RetainExceptOnCreate=True|False
    )
    
  :type ChangeSetName: string
  :param ChangeSetName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the change set that you want use to update the specified stack.

    

  
  :type StackName: string
  :param StackName: 

    If you specified the name of a change set, specify the stack name or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that's associated with the change set you want to execute.

    

  
  :type ClientRequestToken: string
  :param ClientRequestToken: 

    A unique identifier for this ``ExecuteChangeSet`` request. Specify this token if you plan to retry requests so that CloudFormation knows that you're not attempting to execute a change set to update a stack with the same name. You might retry ``ExecuteChangeSet`` requests to ensure that CloudFormation successfully received them.

    

  
  :type DisableRollback: boolean
  :param DisableRollback: 

    Preserves the state of previously provisioned resources when an operation fails. This parameter can't be specified when the ``OnStackFailure`` parameter to the `CreateChangeSet <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_CreateChangeSet.html>`__ API operation was specified.

     

    
    * ``True`` - if the stack creation fails, do nothing. This is equivalent to specifying ``DO_NOTHING`` for the ``OnStackFailure`` parameter to the `CreateChangeSet <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_CreateChangeSet.html>`__ API operation.
     
    * ``False`` - if the stack creation fails, roll back the stack. This is equivalent to specifying ``ROLLBACK`` for the ``OnStackFailure`` parameter to the `CreateChangeSet <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_CreateChangeSet.html>`__ API operation.
    

     

    Default: ``True``

    

  
  :type RetainExceptOnCreate: boolean
  :param RetainExceptOnCreate: 

    When set to ``true``, newly created resources are deleted when the operation rolls back. This includes newly created resources marked with a deletion policy of ``Retain``.

     

    Default: ``false``
