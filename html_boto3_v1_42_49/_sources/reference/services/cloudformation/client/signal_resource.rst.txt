.. py:method:: CloudFormation.Client.signal_resource(**kwargs)

  

  Sends a signal to the specified resource with a success or failure status. You can use the ``SignalResource`` operation in conjunction with a creation policy or update policy. CloudFormation doesn't proceed with a stack creation or update until resources receive the required number of signals or the timeout period is exceeded. The ``SignalResource`` operation is useful in cases where you want to send signals from anywhere other than an Amazon EC2 instance.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.signal_resource(
        StackName='string',
        LogicalResourceId='string',
        UniqueId='string',
        Status='SUCCESS'|'FAILURE'
    )
    
  :type StackName: string
  :param StackName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The stack name or unique stack ID that includes the resource that you want to signal.

    

  
  :type LogicalResourceId: string
  :param LogicalResourceId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The logical ID of the resource that you want to signal. The logical ID is the name of the resource that given in the template.

    

  
  :type UniqueId: string
  :param UniqueId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A unique ID of the signal. When you signal Amazon EC2 instances or Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups, specify the instance ID that you are signaling as the unique ID. If you send multiple signals to a single resource (such as signaling a wait condition), each signal requires a different unique ID.

    

  
  :type Status: string
  :param Status: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The status of the signal, which is either success or failure. A failure signal causes CloudFormation to immediately fail the stack creation or update.
