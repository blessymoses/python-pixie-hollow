.. py:method:: CloudFormation.Client.detect_stack_drift(**kwargs)

  

  Detects whether a stack's actual configuration differs, or has *drifted*, from its expected configuration, as defined in the stack template and any values specified as template parameters. For each resource in the stack that supports drift detection, CloudFormation compares the actual configuration of the resource with its expected template configuration. Only resource properties explicitly defined in the stack template are checked for drift. A stack is considered to have drifted if one or more of its resources differ from their expected template configurations. For more information, see `Detect unmanaged configuration changes to stacks and resources with drift detection <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-stack-drift.html>`__.

   

  Use ``DetectStackDrift`` to detect drift on all supported resources for a given stack, or  DetectStackResourceDrift to detect drift on individual resources.

   

  For a list of stack resources that currently support drift detection, see `Resource type support for imports and drift detection <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/resource-import-supported-resources.html>`__.

   

  ``DetectStackDrift`` can take up to several minutes, depending on the number of resources contained within the stack. Use  DescribeStackDriftDetectionStatus to monitor the progress of a detect stack drift operation. Once the drift detection operation has completed, use  DescribeStackResourceDrifts to return drift information about the stack and its resources.

   

  When detecting drift on a stack, CloudFormation doesn't detect drift on any nested stacks belonging to that stack. Perform ``DetectStackDrift`` directly on the nested stack itself.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.detect_stack_drift(
        StackName='string',
        LogicalResourceIds=[
            'string',
        ]
    )
    
  :type StackName: string
  :param StackName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of the stack for which you want to detect drift.

    

  
  :type LogicalResourceIds: list
  :param LogicalResourceIds: 

    The logical names of any resources you want to use as filters.

    **Response Syntax**

    
    ::

      {
          'StackDriftDetectionId': 'string'
      }
      
    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **StackDriftDetectionId** *(string) --* 

        The ID of the drift detection results of this operation.

         

        CloudFormation generates new results, with a new drift detection ID, each time this operation is run. However, the number of drift results CloudFormation retains for any given stack, and for how long, may vary.
