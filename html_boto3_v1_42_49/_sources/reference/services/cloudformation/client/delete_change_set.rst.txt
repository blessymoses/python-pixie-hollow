.. py:method:: CloudFormation.Client.delete_change_set(**kwargs)

  

  Deletes the specified change set. Deleting change sets ensures that no one executes the wrong change set.

   

  If the call successfully completes, CloudFormation successfully deleted the change set.

   

  If ``IncludeNestedStacks`` specifies ``True`` during the creation of the nested change set, then ``DeleteChangeSet`` will delete all change sets that belong to the stacks hierarchy and will also delete all change sets for nested stacks with the status of ``REVIEW_IN_PROGRESS``.
