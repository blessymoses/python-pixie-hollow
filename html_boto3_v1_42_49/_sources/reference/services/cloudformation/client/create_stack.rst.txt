  :type StackName: string
  :param StackName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name that's associated with the stack. The name must be unique in the Region in which you are creating the stack.

     

    .. note::

      

      A stack name can contain only alphanumeric characters (case sensitive) and hyphens. It must start with an alphabetical character and can't be longer than 128 characters.

      

    

  
  :type TemplateBody: string
  :param TemplateBody: 

    Structure that contains the template body with a minimum length of 1 byte and a maximum length of 51,200 bytes.

     

    Conditional: You must specify either ``TemplateBody`` or ``TemplateURL``, but not both.

    

  
  :type TemplateURL: string
  :param TemplateURL: 

    The URL of a file that contains the template body. The URL must point to a template (max size: 1 MB) that's located in an Amazon S3 bucket or a Systems Manager document. The location for an Amazon S3 bucket must start with ``https://``. URLs from S3 static websites are not supported.

     

    Conditional: You must specify either the ``TemplateBody`` or the ``TemplateURL`` parameter, but not both.

    

  
  :type Parameters: list
  :param Parameters: 

    A list of ``Parameter`` structures that specify input parameters for the stack. For more information, see the `Parameter <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_Parameter.html>`__ data type.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      The ``Parameter`` data type.

      

    
      - **ParameterKey** *(string) --* 

        The key associated with the parameter. If you don't specify a key and value for a particular parameter, CloudFormation uses the default value that's specified in your template.

        

      
      - **ParameterValue** *(string) --* 

        The input value associated with the parameter.

        

      
      - **UsePreviousValue** *(boolean) --* 

        During a stack update, use the existing parameter value that the stack is using for a given parameter key. If you specify ``true``, do not specify a parameter value.

        

      
      - **ResolvedValue** *(string) --* 

        Read-only. The value that corresponds to a Systems Manager parameter key. This field is returned only for Systems Manager parameter types in the template. For more information, see `Specify existing resources at runtime with CloudFormation-supplied parameter types <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cloudformation-supplied-parameter-types.html>`__ in the *CloudFormation User Guide*.

        

      
    

  :type DisableRollback: boolean
  :param DisableRollback: 

    Set to ``true`` to disable rollback of the stack if stack creation failed. You can specify either ``DisableRollback`` or ``OnFailure``, but not both.

     

    Default: ``false``

    

  
  :type RollbackConfiguration: dict
  :param RollbackConfiguration: 

    The rollback triggers for CloudFormation to monitor during stack creation and updating operations, and for the specified monitoring period afterwards.

    

  
    - **RollbackTriggers** *(list) --* 

      The triggers to monitor during stack creation or update actions.

       

      By default, CloudFormation saves the rollback triggers specified for a stack and applies them to any subsequent update operations for the stack, unless you specify otherwise. If you do specify rollback triggers for this parameter, those triggers replace any list of triggers previously specified for the stack. This means:

       

      
      * To use the rollback triggers previously specified for this stack, if any, don't specify this parameter.
       
      * To specify new or updated rollback triggers, you must specify *all* the triggers that you want used for this stack, even triggers you've specified before (for example, when creating the stack or during a previous stack update). Any triggers that you don't include in the updated list of triggers are no longer applied to the stack.
       
      * To remove all currently specified triggers, specify an empty list for this parameter.
      

       

      If a specified trigger is missing, the entire stack operation fails and is rolled back.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        A rollback trigger CloudFormation monitors during creation and updating of stacks. If any of the alarms you specify goes to ALARM state during the stack operation or within the specified monitoring period afterwards, CloudFormation rolls back the entire stack operation.

        

      
        - **Arn** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the rollback trigger.

           

          If a specified trigger is missing, the entire stack operation fails and is rolled back.

          

        
        - **Type** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The resource type of the rollback trigger. Specify either `AWS\:\:CloudWatch\:\:Alarm <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-resource-cloudwatch-alarm.html>`__ or `AWS\:\:CloudWatch\:\:CompositeAlarm <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-resource-cloudwatch-compositealarm.html>`__ resource types.

          

        
      
  
    - **MonitoringTimeInMinutes** *(integer) --* 

      The amount of time, in minutes, during which CloudFormation should monitor all the rollback triggers after the stack creation or update operation deploys all necessary resources.

       

      The default is 0 minutes.

       

      If you specify a monitoring period but don't specify any rollback triggers, CloudFormation still waits the specified period of time before cleaning up old resources after update operations. You can use this monitoring period to perform any manual stack validation desired, and manually cancel the stack creation or update (using `CancelUpdateStack <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_CancelUpdateStack.html>`__, for example) as necessary.

       

      If you specify 0 for this parameter, CloudFormation still monitors the specified rollback triggers during stack creation and update operations. Then, for update operations, it begins disposing of old resources immediately once the operation completes.

      

    
  
  :type TimeoutInMinutes: integer
  :param TimeoutInMinutes: 

    The amount of time that can pass before the stack status becomes ``CREATE_FAILED``; if ``DisableRollback`` is not set or is set to ``false``, the stack will be rolled back.

    

  
  :type NotificationARNs: list
  :param NotificationARNs: 

    The Amazon SNS topic ARNs to publish stack related events. You can find your Amazon SNS topic ARNs using the Amazon SNS console or your Command Line Interface (CLI).

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type Capabilities: list
  :param Capabilities: 

    In some cases, you must explicitly acknowledge that your stack template contains certain capabilities in order for CloudFormation to create the stack.

     

    
    * ``CAPABILITY_IAM`` and ``CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM`` Some stack templates might include resources that can affect permissions in your Amazon Web Services account; for example, by creating new IAM users. For those stacks, you must explicitly acknowledge this by specifying one of these capabilities. The following IAM resources require you to specify either the ``CAPABILITY_IAM`` or ``CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM`` capability. 

      
      * If you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability.
       
      * If you have IAM resources with custom names, you *must* specify ``CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM``.
       
      * If you don't specify either of these capabilities, CloudFormation returns an ``InsufficientCapabilities`` error.
      

     

    If your stack template contains these resources, we recommend that you review all permissions associated with them and edit their permissions if necessary.

     

      
      * `AWS\:\:IAM\:\:AccessKey <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-resource-iam-accesskey.html>`__
       
      * `AWS\:\:IAM\:\:Group <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-resource-iam-group.html>`__
       
      * `AWS\:\:IAM\:\:InstanceProfile <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-resource-iam-instanceprofile.html>`__
       
      * `AWS\:\:IAM\:\:ManagedPolicy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-resource-iam-managedpolicy.html>`__
       
      * `AWS\:\:IAM\:\:Policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-resource-iam-policy.html>`__
       
      * `AWS\:\:IAM\:\:Role <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-resource-iam-role.html>`__
       
      * `AWS\:\:IAM\:\:User <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-resource-iam-user.html>`__
       
      * `AWS\:\:IAM\:\:UserToGroupAddition <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-resource-iam-usertogroupaddition.html>`__
      

     

    For more information, see `Acknowledging IAM resources in CloudFormation templates <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/control-access-with-iam.html#using-iam-capabilities>`__.

    
     
    * ``CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND`` Some template contain macros. Macros perform custom processing on templates; this can include simple actions like find-and-replace operations, all the way to extensive transformations of entire templates. Because of this, users typically create a change set from the processed template, so that they can review the changes resulting from the macros before actually creating the stack. If your stack template contains one or more macros, and you choose to create a stack directly from the processed template, without first reviewing the resulting changes in a change set, you must acknowledge this capability. This includes the `AWS\:\:Include <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/transform-aws-include.html>`__ and `AWS\:\:Serverless <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/transform-aws-serverless.html>`__ transforms, which are macros hosted by CloudFormation. If you want to create a stack from a stack template that contains macros *and* nested stacks, you must create the stack directly from the template using this capability. 

    .. warning::

      You should only create stacks directly from a stack template that contains macros if you know what processing the macro performs. Each macro relies on an underlying Lambda service function for processing stack templates. Be aware that the Lambda function owner can update the function operation without CloudFormation being notified.

     For more information, see `Perform custom processing on CloudFormation templates with template macros <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-macros.html>`__.
    

     

    .. note::

      

      Only one of the ``Capabilities`` and ``ResourceType`` parameters can be specified.

      

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type ResourceTypes: list
  :param ResourceTypes: 

    Specifies which resource types you can work with, such as ``AWS::EC2::Instance`` or ``Custom::MyCustomInstance``.

     

    If the list of resource types doesn't include a resource that you're creating, the stack creation fails. By default, CloudFormation grants permissions to all resource types. IAM uses this parameter for CloudFormation-specific condition keys in IAM policies. For more information, see `Control CloudFormation access with Identity and Access Management <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/control-access-with-iam.html>`__.

     

    .. note::

      

      Only one of the ``Capabilities`` and ``ResourceType`` parameters can be specified.

      

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type RoleARN: string
  :param RoleARN: 

    The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role that CloudFormation assumes to create the stack. CloudFormation uses the role's credentials to make calls on your behalf. CloudFormation always uses this role for all future operations on the stack. Provided that users have permission to operate on the stack, CloudFormation uses this role even if the users don't have permission to pass it. Ensure that the role grants least privilege.

     

    If you don't specify a value, CloudFormation uses the role that was previously associated with the stack. If no role is available, CloudFormation uses a temporary session that's generated from your user credentials.

    

  
  :type OnFailure: string
  :param OnFailure: 

    Determines what action will be taken if stack creation fails. This must be one of: ``DO_NOTHING``, ``ROLLBACK``, or ``DELETE``. You can specify either ``OnFailure`` or ``DisableRollback``, but not both.

     

    .. note::

      

      Although the default setting is ``ROLLBACK``, there is one exception. This exception occurs when a StackSet attempts to deploy a stack instance and the stack instance fails to create successfully. In this case, the ``CreateStack`` call overrides the default setting and sets the value of ``OnFailure`` to ``DELETE``.

      

     

    Default: ``ROLLBACK``

    

  
  :type StackPolicyBody: string
  :param StackPolicyBody: 

    Structure that contains the stack policy body. For more information, see `Prevent updates to stack resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/protect-stack-resources.html>`__ in the *CloudFormation User Guide*. You can specify either the ``StackPolicyBody`` or the ``StackPolicyURL`` parameter, but not both.

    

  
  :type StackPolicyURL: string
  :param StackPolicyURL: 

    Location of a file that contains the stack policy. The URL must point to a policy (maximum size: 16 KB) located in an S3 bucket in the same Region as the stack. The location for an Amazon S3 bucket must start with ``https://``. URLs from S3 static websites are not supported.

     

    You can specify either the ``StackPolicyBody`` or the ``StackPolicyURL`` parameter, but not both.

    

  
  :type Tags: list
  :param Tags: 

    Key-value pairs to associate with this stack. CloudFormation also propagates these tags to the resources created in the stack. A maximum number of 50 tags can be specified.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      The Tag type enables you to specify a key-value pair that can be used to store information about an CloudFormation stack.

      

    
      - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        A string used to identify this tag. You can specify a maximum of 128 characters for a tag key. Tags owned by Amazon Web Services have the reserved prefix: ``aws:``.

        

      
      - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        A string that contains the value for this tag. You can specify a maximum of 256 characters for a tag value.

        

      
    

  :type ClientRequestToken: string
  :param ClientRequestToken: 

    A unique identifier for this ``CreateStack`` request. Specify this token if you plan to retry requests so that CloudFormation knows that you're not attempting to create a stack with the same name. You might retry ``CreateStack`` requests to ensure that CloudFormation successfully received them.

     

    All events initiated by a given stack operation are assigned the same client request token, which you can use to track operations. For example, if you execute a ``CreateStack`` operation with the token ``token1``, then all the ``StackEvents`` generated by that operation will have ``ClientRequestToken`` set as ``token1``.

     

    In the console, stack operations display the client request token on the Events tab. Stack operations that are initiated from the console use the token format *Console-StackOperation-ID*, which helps you easily identify the stack operation . For example, if you create a stack using the console, each stack event would be assigned the same token in the following format: ``Console-CreateStack-7f59c3cf-00d2-40c7-b2ff-e75db0987002``.

    

  
  :type EnableTerminationProtection: boolean
  :param EnableTerminationProtection: 

    Whether to enable termination protection on the specified stack. If a user attempts to delete a stack with termination protection enabled, the operation fails and the stack remains unchanged. For more information, see `Protect CloudFormation stacks from being deleted <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-protect-stacks.html>`__ in the *CloudFormation User Guide*. Termination protection is deactivated on stacks by default.

     

    For `nested stacks <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-nested-stacks.html>`__, termination protection is set on the root stack and can't be changed directly on the nested stack.

    

  
  :type RetainExceptOnCreate: boolean
  :param RetainExceptOnCreate: 

    When set to ``true``, newly created resources are deleted when the operation rolls back. This includes newly created resources marked with a deletion policy of ``Retain``.

     

    Default: ``false``
