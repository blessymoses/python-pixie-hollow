.. py:class:: SNS.Client

  A low-level client representing Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)
   

  Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a web service that enables you to build distributed web-enabled applications. Applications can use Amazon SNS to easily push real-time notification messages to interested subscribers over multiple delivery protocols. For more information about this product see the `Amazon SNS product page <http://aws.amazon.com/sns/>`__. For detailed information about Amazon SNS features and their associated API calls, see the `Amazon SNS Developer Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/>`__.

   

  For information on the permissions you need to use this API, see `Identity and access management in Amazon SNS <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-authentication-and-access-control.html>`__ in the *Amazon SNS Developer Guide.*

   

  We also provide SDKs that enable you to access Amazon SNS from your preferred programming language. The SDKs contain functionality that automatically takes care of tasks such as: cryptographically signing your service requests, retrying requests, and handling error responses. For a list of available SDKs, go to `Tools for Amazon Web Services <http://aws.amazon.com/tools/>`__.
