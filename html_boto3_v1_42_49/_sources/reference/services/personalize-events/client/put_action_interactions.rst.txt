.. py:method:: PersonalizeEvents.Client.put_action_interactions(**kwargs)

  

  Records action interaction event data. An *action interaction* event is an interaction between a user and an *action*. For example, a user taking an action, such a enrolling in a membership program or downloading your app.

   

  For more information about recording action interactions, see `Recording action interaction events <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/recording-action-interaction-events.html>`__. For more information about actions in an Actions dataset, see `Actions dataset <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/actions-datasets.html>`__.

                'actionId': 'string',

            },
        ]
    )
    
  :type trackingId: string
  :param trackingId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ID of your action interaction event tracker. When you create an Action interactions dataset, Amazon Personalize creates an action interaction event tracker for you. For more information, see `Action interaction event tracker ID <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/action-interaction-tracker-id.html>`__.

    

  
  :type actionInteractions: list
  :param actionInteractions: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A list of action interaction events from the session.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      Represents an action interaction event sent using the ``PutActionInteractions`` API.

      

    
      - **actionId** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The ID of the action the user interacted with. This corresponds to the ``ACTION_ID`` field of the Action interaction schema.

        

      
      - **userId** *(string) --* 

        The ID of the user who interacted with the action. This corresponds to the ``USER_ID`` field of the Action interaction schema.

        

      
      - **sessionId** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The ID associated with the user's visit. Your application generates a unique ``sessionId`` when a user first visits your website or uses your application.

        

      
      - **timestamp** *(datetime) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The timestamp for when the action interaction event occurred. Timestamps must be in Unix epoch time format, in seconds.

        

      
      - **eventType** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The type of action interaction event. You can specify ``Viewed``, ``Taken``, and ``Not Taken`` event types. For more information about action interaction event type data, see `Event type data <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/action-interaction-event-type-data.html>`__.

        

      
      - **eventId** *(string) --* 

        An ID associated with the event. If an event ID is not provided, Amazon Personalize generates a unique ID for the event. An event ID is not used as an input to the model. Amazon Personalize uses the event ID to distinguish unique events. Any subsequent events after the first with the same event ID are not used in model training.

        

      
      - **recommendationId** *(string) --* 

        The ID of the list of recommendations that contains the action the user interacted with.

        

      
      - **impression** *(list) --* 

        A list of action IDs that represents the sequence of actions you have shown the user. For example, ``["actionId1", "actionId2", "actionId3"]``. Amazon Personalize doesn't use impressions data from action interaction events. Instead, record multiple events for each action and use the ``Viewed`` event type.

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
    
      - **properties** *(string) --* 

        A string map of event-specific data that you might choose to record. For example, if a user takes an action, other than the action ID, you might also send the number of actions taken by the user.

         

        Each item in the map consists of a key-value pair. For example,

         

        ``{"numberOfActions": "12"}``

         

        The keys use camel case names that match the fields in the Action interactions schema. In the above example, the ``numberOfActions`` would match the 'NUMBER_OF_ACTIONS' field defined in the Action interactions schema.

         

        The following can't be included as a keyword for properties (case insensitive).

         

        
        * userId
         
        * sessionId
         
        * eventType
         
        * timestamp
         
        * recommendationId
         
        * impression
