.. py:method:: SSOAdmin.Client.list_application_assignments_for_principal(**kwargs)

  

  Lists the applications to which a specified principal is assigned. You must provide a filter when calling this action from a member account against your organization instance of IAM Identity Center. A filter is not required when called from the management account against an organization instance of IAM Identity Center, or from a member account against an account instance of IAM Identity Center in the same account.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_application_assignments_for_principal(
        InstanceArn='string',
        PrincipalId='string',
        PrincipalType='USER'|'GROUP',
        Filter={
            'ApplicationArn': 'string'
        },
        NextToken='string',
        MaxResults=123
    )
    
  :type InstanceArn: string
  :param InstanceArn: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies the instance of IAM Identity Center that contains principal and applications.

    

  
  :type PrincipalId: string
  :param PrincipalId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies the unique identifier of the principal for which you want to retrieve its assignments.

    

  
  :type PrincipalType: string
  :param PrincipalType: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies the type of the principal for which you want to retrieve its assignments.

    

  
  :type Filter: dict
  :param Filter: 

    Filters the output to include only assignments associated with the application that has the specified ARN.

    

  
    - **ApplicationArn** *(string) --* 

      The ARN of an application.

      

    
  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    Specifies that you want to receive the next page of results. Valid only if you received a ``NextToken`` response in the previous request. If you did, it indicates that more output is available. Set this parameter to the value provided by the previous call's ``NextToken`` response to request the next page of results.

    

  
  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    Specifies the total number of results that you want included in each response. If additional items exist beyond the number you specify, the ``NextToken`` response element is returned with a value (not null). Include the specified value as the ``NextToken`` request parameter in the next call to the operation to get the next set of results. Note that the service might return fewer results than the maximum even when there are more results available. You should check ``NextToken`` after every operation to ensure that you receive all of the results.

    **Response Syntax**

    
    ::

      {
          'ApplicationAssignments': [
              {
                  'ApplicationArn': 'string',

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **ApplicationAssignments** *(list) --* 

        An array list of the application assignments for the specified principal.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          A structure that describes an application to which a principal is assigned.

          
          

          - **ApplicationArn** *(string) --* 

            The ARN of the application to which the specified principal is assigned.

            
          

          - **PrincipalId** *(string) --* 

            The unique identifier of the principal assigned to the application.

            
          

          - **PrincipalType** *(string) --* 

            The type of the principal assigned to the application.

            
      
    
      

      - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

        If present, this value indicates that more output is available than is included in the current response. Use this value in the ``NextToken`` request parameter in a subsequent call to the operation to get the next part of the output. You should repeat this until the ``NextToken`` response element comes back as ``null``. This indicates that this is the last page of results.
