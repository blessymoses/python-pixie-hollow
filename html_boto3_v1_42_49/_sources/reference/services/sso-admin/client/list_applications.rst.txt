.. py:method:: SSOAdmin.Client.list_applications(**kwargs)

  

  Lists all applications associated with the instance of IAM Identity Center. When listing applications for an organization instance in the management account, member accounts must use the ``applicationAccount`` parameter to filter the list to only applications created from that account. When listing applications for an account instance in the same member account, a filter is not required.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_applications(
        InstanceArn='string',
        MaxResults=123,
        NextToken='string',
        Filter={
            'ApplicationAccount': 'string',
            'ApplicationProvider': 'string'
        }
    )
    
  :type InstanceArn: string
  :param InstanceArn: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ARN of the IAM Identity Center application under which the operation will run. For more information about ARNs, see `Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and Amazon Web Services Service Namespaces </general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*.

    

  
  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    Specifies the total number of results that you want included in each response. If additional items exist beyond the number you specify, the ``NextToken`` response element is returned with a value (not null). Include the specified value as the ``NextToken`` request parameter in the next call to the operation to get the next set of results. Note that the service might return fewer results than the maximum even when there are more results available. You should check ``NextToken`` after every operation to ensure that you receive all of the results.

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    Specifies that you want to receive the next page of results. Valid only if you received a ``NextToken`` response in the previous request. If you did, it indicates that more output is available. Set this parameter to the value provided by the previous call's ``NextToken`` response to request the next page of results.

    

  
  :type Filter: dict
  :param Filter: 

    Filters response results.

    

  
    - **ApplicationAccount** *(string) --* 

      An Amazon Web Services account ID number that filters the results in the response.

      

    
    - **ApplicationProvider** *(string) --* 

      The ARN of an application provider that can filter the results in the response.

              - **Origin** *(string) --* 

                This determines how IAM Identity Center navigates the user to the target application. It can be one of the following values:

                 

                
                * ``APPLICATION``: IAM Identity Center redirects the customer to the configured ``ApplicationUrl``.
                 
                * ``IDENTITY_CENTER``: IAM Identity Center uses SAML identity-provider initiated authentication to sign the customer directly into a SAML-based application.
                

                
              

              - **ApplicationUrl** *(string) --* 

                The URL that accepts authentication requests for an application. This is a required parameter if the ``Origin`` parameter is ``APPLICATION``.

      - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

        If present, this value indicates that more output is available than is included in the current response. Use this value in the ``NextToken`` request parameter in a subsequent call to the operation to get the next part of the output. You should repeat this until the ``NextToken`` response element comes back as ``null``. This indicates that this is the last page of results.
