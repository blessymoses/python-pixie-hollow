  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_account_assignments_for_principal(
        InstanceArn='string',
        PrincipalId='string',
        PrincipalType='USER'|'GROUP',
        Filter={
            'AccountId': 'string'
        },
        NextToken='string',
        MaxResults=123
    )
    
  :type InstanceArn: string
  :param InstanceArn: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies the ARN of the instance of IAM Identity Center that contains the principal.

    

  
  :type PrincipalId: string
  :param PrincipalId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies the principal for which you want to retrieve the list of account assignments.

    

  
  :type PrincipalType: string
  :param PrincipalType: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies the type of the principal.

    

  
  :type Filter: dict
  :param Filter: 

    Specifies an Amazon Web Services account ID number. Results are filtered to only those that match this ID number.

    

  
    - **AccountId** *(string) --* 

      The ID number of an Amazon Web Services account that filters the results in the response.

      

    
  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    Specifies that you want to receive the next page of results. Valid only if you received a ``NextToken`` response in the previous request. If you did, it indicates that more output is available. Set this parameter to the value provided by the previous call's ``NextToken`` response to request the next page of results.

    

  
  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    Specifies the total number of results that you want included in each response. If additional items exist beyond the number you specify, the ``NextToken`` response element is returned with a value (not null). Include the specified value as the ``NextToken`` request parameter in the next call to the operation to get the next set of results. Note that the service might return fewer results than the maximum even when there are more results available. You should check ``NextToken`` after every operation to ensure that you receive all of the results.
