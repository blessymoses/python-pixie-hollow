.. py:method:: SQS.Queue.delete()

  

  Deletes the queue specified by the ``QueueUrl``, regardless of the queue's contents.

   

  .. warning::

     

    Be careful with the ``DeleteQueue`` action: When you delete a queue, any messages in the queue are no longer available.

     

   

  When you delete a queue, the deletion process takes up to 60 seconds. Requests you send involving that queue during the 60 seconds might succeed. For example, a ``SendMessage`` request might succeed, but after 60 seconds the queue and the message you sent no longer exist.

   

  When you delete a queue, you must wait at least 60 seconds before creating a queue with the same name.

   

  .. note::

    

    Cross-account permissions don't apply to this action. For more information, see `Grant cross-account permissions to a role and a username <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-customer-managed-policy-examples.html#grant-cross-account-permissions-to-role-and-user-name>`__ in the *Amazon SQS Developer Guide*.

     

    The delete operation uses the HTTP ``GET`` verb.
