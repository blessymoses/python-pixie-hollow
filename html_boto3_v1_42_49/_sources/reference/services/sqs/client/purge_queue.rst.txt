.. py:method:: SQS.Client.purge_queue(**kwargs)

  

  Deletes available messages in a queue (including in-flight messages) specified by the ``QueueURL`` parameter.

   

  .. warning::

     

    When you use the ``PurgeQueue`` action, you can't retrieve any messages deleted from a queue.

     

    The message deletion process takes up to 60 seconds. We recommend waiting for 60 seconds regardless of your queue's size.

     

   

  Messages sent to the queue *before* you call ``PurgeQueue`` might be received but are deleted within the next minute.

   

  Messages sent to the queue *after* you call ``PurgeQueue`` might be deleted while the queue is being purged.
