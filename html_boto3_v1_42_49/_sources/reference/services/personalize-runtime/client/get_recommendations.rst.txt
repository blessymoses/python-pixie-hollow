*******************



.. py:method:: PersonalizeRuntime.Client.get_recommendations(**kwargs)

  

  Returns a list of recommended items. For campaigns, the campaign's Amazon Resource Name (ARN) is required and the required user and item input depends on the recipe type used to create the solution backing the campaign as follows:

   

  
  * USER_PERSONALIZATION - ``userId`` required, ``itemId`` not used
   
  * RELATED_ITEMS - ``itemId`` required, ``userId`` not used
  

   

  .. note::

    

    Campaigns that are backed by a solution created using a recipe of type PERSONALIZED_RANKING use the API.

    

   

  For recommenders, the recommender's ARN is required and the required item and user input depends on the use case (domain-based recipe) backing the recommender. For information on use case requirements see `Choosing recommender use cases <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/domain-use-cases.html>`__.

  :type itemId: string
  :param itemId: 

    The item ID to provide recommendations for.

     

    Required for ``RELATED_ITEMS`` recipe type.

    

  
  :type userId: string
  :param userId: 

    The user ID to provide recommendations for.

     

    Required for ``USER_PERSONALIZATION`` recipe type.

    

  
  :type numResults: integer
  :param numResults: 

    The number of results to return. The default is 25. If you are including metadata in recommendations, the maximum is 50. Otherwise, the maximum is 500.

    

  
  :type context: dict
  :param context:

  :type filterArn: string
  :param filterArn: 

    The ARN of the filter to apply to the returned recommendations. For more information, see `Filtering Recommendations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/filter.html>`__.

     

    When using this parameter, be sure the filter resource is ``ACTIVE``.

    

  
  :type filterValues: dict
  :param filterValues: 

    The values to use when filtering recommendations. For each placeholder parameter in your filter expression, provide the parameter name (in matching case) as a key and the filter value(s) as the corresponding value. Separate multiple values for one parameter with a comma.

     

    For filter expressions that use an ``INCLUDE`` element to include items, you must provide values for all parameters that are defined in the expression. For filters with expressions that use an ``EXCLUDE`` element to exclude items, you can omit the ``filter-values``.In this case, Amazon Personalize doesn't use that portion of the expression to filter recommendations.

          - **score** *(float) --* 

            A numeric representation of the model's certainty that the item will be the next user selection. For more information on scoring logic, see  how-scores-work.

            
          

          - **promotionName** *(string) --* 

            The name of the promotion that included the predicted item.

          - **reason** *(list) --* 

            If you use User-Personalization-v2, a list of reasons for why the item was included in recommendations. Possible reasons include the following:

             

            
            * Promoted item - Indicates the item was included as part of a promotion that you applied in your recommendation request.
             
            * Exploration - Indicates the item was included with exploration. With exploration, recommendations include items with less interactions data or relevance for the user. For more information about exploration, see `Exploration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/use-case-recipe-features.html#about-exploration>`__.
             
            * Popular item - Indicates the item was included as a placeholder popular item. If you use a filter, depending on how many recommendations the filter removes, Amazon Personalize might add placeholder items to meet the ``numResults`` for your recommendation request. These items are popular items, based on interactions data, that satisfy your filter criteria. They don't have a relevance score for the user.
