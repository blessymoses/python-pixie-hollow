        }
    )
    
  :type campaignArn: string
  :param campaignArn: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the campaign to use for generating the personalized ranking.

    

  
  :type inputList: list
  :param inputList: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A list of items (by ``itemId``) to rank. If an item was not included in the training dataset, the item is appended to the end of the reranked list. If you are including metadata in recommendations, the maximum is 50. Otherwise, the maximum is 500.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type userId: string
  :param userId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The user for which you want the campaign to provide a personalized ranking.

    

  
  :type context: dict
  :param context: 

    The contextual metadata to use when getting recommendations. Contextual metadata includes any interaction information that might be relevant when getting a user's recommendations, such as the user's current location or device type.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    
      - *(string) --* 

      


  :type filterArn: string
  :param filterArn: 

    The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a filter you created to include items or exclude items from recommendations for a given user. For more information, see `Filtering Recommendations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/filter.html>`__.

    

  
  :type filterValues: dict
  :param filterValues: 

    The values to use when filtering recommendations. For each placeholder parameter in your filter expression, provide the parameter name (in matching case) as a key and the filter value(s) as the corresponding value. Separate multiple values for one parameter with a comma.

     

    For filter expressions that use an ``INCLUDE`` element to include items, you must provide values for all parameters that are defined in the expression. For filters with expressions that use an ``EXCLUDE`` element to exclude items, you can omit the ``filter-values``.In this case, Amazon Personalize doesn't use that portion of the expression to filter recommendations.

     

    For more information, see `Filtering Recommendations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/filter.html>`__.

  :type metadataColumns: dict
  :param metadataColumns: 

    If you enabled metadata in recommendations when you created or updated the campaign, specify metadata columns from your Items dataset to include in the personalized ranking. The map key is ``ITEMS`` and the value is a list of column names from your Items dataset. The maximum number of columns you can provide is 10.

          - **score** *(float) --* 

            A numeric representation of the model's certainty that the item will be the next user selection. For more information on scoring logic, see  how-scores-work.

            
          

          - **promotionName** *(string) --* 

            The name of the promotion that included the predicted item.

            
          

          - **metadata** *(dict) --*

          - **reason** *(list) --* 

            If you use User-Personalization-v2, a list of reasons for why the item was included in recommendations. Possible reasons include the following:

             

            
            * Promoted item - Indicates the item was included as part of a promotion that you applied in your recommendation request.
             
            * Exploration - Indicates the item was included with exploration. With exploration, recommendations include items with less interactions data or relevance for the user. For more information about exploration, see `Exploration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/use-case-recipe-features.html#about-exploration>`__.
             
            * Popular item - Indicates the item was included as a placeholder popular item. If you use a filter, depending on how many recommendations the filter removes, Amazon Personalize might add placeholder items to meet the ``numResults`` for your recommendation request. These items are popular items, based on interactions data, that satisfy your filter criteria. They don't have a relevance score for the user.

        The ID of the recommendation.
