.. py:method:: CloudWatchObservabilityAccessManager.Client.get_link(**kwargs)

  

  Returns complete information about one link.

   

  To use this operation, provide the link ARN. To retrieve a list of link ARNs, use `ListLinks <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/OAM/latest/APIReference/API_ListLinks.html>`__.

  

  See also: `AWS API Documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/oam-2022-06-10/GetLink>`_  


  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.get_link(
        Identifier='string',
        IncludeTags=True|False
    )
    
  :type Identifier: string
  :param Identifier: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ARN of the link to retrieve information for.

    

  
  :type IncludeTags: boolean
  :param IncludeTags: 

    Specifies whether to include the tags associated with the link in the response. When ``IncludeTags`` is set to ``true`` and the caller has the required permission, ``oam:ListTagsForResource``, the API will return the tags for the specified resource. If the caller doesn't have the required permission, ``oam:ListTagsForResource``, the API will raise an exception.

     

    The default value is ``false``.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **Arn** *(string) --* 

        The ARN of the link.

        
      

      - **Id** *(string) --* 

        The random ID string that Amazon Web Services generated as part of the link ARN.

        
      

      - **Label** *(string) --* 

        The label that you assigned to this link, with the variables resolved to their actual values.

        
      

      - **LabelTemplate** *(string) --* 

        The exact label template that was specified when the link was created, with the template variables not resolved.

        
      

      - **LinkConfiguration** *(dict) --* 

        This structure includes filters that specify which metric namespaces and which log groups are shared from the source account to the monitoring account.

        
        

        - **LogGroupConfiguration** *(dict) --* 

          Use this structure to filter which log groups are to send log events from the source account to the monitoring account.

          
          

          - **Filter** *(string) --* 

            Use this field to specify which log groups are to share their log events with the monitoring account. Use the term ``LogGroupName`` and one or more of the following operands. Use single quotation marks (') around log group names. The matching of log group names is case sensitive. Each filter has a limit of five conditional operands. Conditional operands are ``AND`` and ``OR``.

             

            
            * ``=`` and ``!=``
             
            * ``AND``
             
            * ``OR``
             
            * ``LIKE`` and ``NOT LIKE``. These can be used only as prefix searches. Include a ``%`` at the end of the string that you want to search for and include.
             
            * ``IN`` and ``NOT IN``, using parentheses ``( )``
            

             

            Examples:

             

            
            * ``LogGroupName IN ('This-Log-Group', 'Other-Log-Group')`` includes only the log groups with names ``This-Log-Group`` and ``Other-Log-Group``.
             
            * ``LogGroupName NOT IN ('Private-Log-Group', 'Private-Log-Group-2')`` includes all log groups except the log groups with names ``Private-Log-Group`` and ``Private-Log-Group-2``.
             
            * ``LogGroupName LIKE 'aws/lambda/%' OR LogGroupName LIKE 'AWSLogs%'`` includes all log groups that have names that start with ``aws/lambda/`` or ``AWSLogs``.
            

             

            .. note::

              

              If you are updating a link that uses filters, you can specify ``*`` as the only value for the ``filter`` parameter to delete the filter and share all log groups with the monitoring account.

              

            
      
        

        - **MetricConfiguration** *(dict) --* 

          Use this structure to filter which metric namespaces are to be shared from the source account to the monitoring account.

          
          

          - **Filter** *(string) --* 

            Use this field to specify which metrics are to be shared with the monitoring account. Use the term ``Namespace`` and one or more of the following operands. Use single quotation marks (') around namespace names. The matching of namespace names is case sensitive. Each filter has a limit of five conditional operands. Conditional operands are ``AND`` and ``OR``.

             

            
            * ``=`` and ``!=``
             
            * ``AND``
             
            * ``OR``
             
            * ``LIKE`` and ``NOT LIKE``. These can be used only as prefix searches. Include a ``%`` at the end of the string that you want to search for and include.
             
            * ``IN`` and ``NOT IN``, using parentheses ``( )``
            

             

            Examples:

             

            
            * ``Namespace NOT LIKE 'AWS/%'`` includes only namespaces that don't start with ``AWS/``, such as custom namespaces.
             
            * ``Namespace IN ('AWS/EC2', 'AWS/ELB', 'AWS/S3')`` includes only the metrics in the EC2, Elastic Load Balancing, and Amazon S3 namespaces.
             
            * ``Namespace = 'AWS/EC2' OR Namespace NOT LIKE 'AWS/%'`` includes only the EC2 namespace and your custom namespaces.
