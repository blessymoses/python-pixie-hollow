  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_gateway_routes(
        limit=123,
        meshName='string',
        meshOwner='string',
        nextToken='string',
        virtualGatewayName='string'
    )
    
  :type limit: integer
  :param limit: 

    The maximum number of results returned by ``ListGatewayRoutes`` in paginated output. When you use this parameter, ``ListGatewayRoutes`` returns only ``limit`` results in a single page along with a ``nextToken`` response element. You can see the remaining results of the initial request by sending another ``ListGatewayRoutes`` request with the returned ``nextToken`` value. This value can be between 1 and 100. If you don't use this parameter, ``ListGatewayRoutes`` returns up to 100 results and a ``nextToken`` value if applicable.

    

  
  :type meshName: string
  :param meshName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of the service mesh to list gateway routes in.

    

  
  :type meshOwner: string
  :param meshOwner: 

    The Amazon Web Services IAM account ID of the service mesh owner. If the account ID is not your own, then it's the ID of the account that shared the mesh with your account. For more information about mesh sharing, see `Working with shared meshes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/app-mesh/latest/userguide/sharing.html>`__.

    

  
  :type nextToken: string
  :param nextToken: 

    The ``nextToken`` value returned from a previous paginated ``ListGatewayRoutes`` request where ``limit`` was used and the results exceeded the value of that parameter. Pagination continues from the end of the previous results that returned the ``nextToken`` value.

    

  
  :type virtualGatewayName: string
  :param virtualGatewayName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of the virtual gateway to list gateway routes in.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **gatewayRoutes** *(list) --* 

        The list of existing gateway routes for the specified service mesh and virtual gateway.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          An object that represents a gateway route returned by a list operation.

          
          

          - **arn** *(string) --* 

            The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the gateway route.

            
          

          - **createdAt** *(datetime) --* 

            The Unix epoch timestamp in seconds for when the resource was created.

            
          

          - **gatewayRouteName** *(string) --* 

            The name of the gateway route.

            
          

          - **lastUpdatedAt** *(datetime) --* 

            The Unix epoch timestamp in seconds for when the resource was last updated.

            
          

          - **meshName** *(string) --* 

            The name of the service mesh that the resource resides in.

            
          

          - **meshOwner** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Web Services IAM account ID of the service mesh owner. If the account ID is not your own, then it's the ID of the account that shared the mesh with your account.

          - **virtualGatewayName** *(string) --* 

            The virtual gateway that the gateway route is associated with.

            
      
    
      

      - **nextToken** *(string) --* 

        The ``nextToken`` value to include in a future ``ListGatewayRoutes`` request. When the results of a ``ListGatewayRoutes`` request exceed ``limit``, you can use this value to retrieve the next page of results. This value is ``null`` when there are no more results to return.
