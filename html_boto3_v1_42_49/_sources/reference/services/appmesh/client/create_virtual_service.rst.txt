.. py:method:: AppMesh.Client.create_virtual_service(**kwargs)

  

  Creates a virtual service within a service mesh.

   

  A virtual service is an abstraction of a real service that is provided by a virtual node directly or indirectly by means of a virtual router. Dependent services call your virtual service by its ``virtualServiceName``, and those requests are routed to the virtual node or virtual router that is specified as the provider for the virtual service.

   

  For more information about virtual services, see `Virtual services <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/app-mesh/latest/userguide/virtual_services.html>`__.

    - *(dict) --* 

      Optional metadata that you apply to a resource to assist with categorization and organization. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define.

      - **key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        One part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A ``key`` is a general label that acts like a category for more specific tag values.

        

      
      - **value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The optional part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A ``value`` acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).
