  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_routes(
        limit=123,
        meshName='string',
        meshOwner='string',
        nextToken='string',
        virtualRouterName='string'
    )
    
  :type limit: integer
  :param limit: 

    The maximum number of results returned by ``ListRoutes`` in paginated output. When you use this parameter, ``ListRoutes`` returns only ``limit`` results in a single page along with a ``nextToken`` response element. You can see the remaining results of the initial request by sending another ``ListRoutes`` request with the returned ``nextToken`` value. This value can be between 1 and 100. If you don't use this parameter, ``ListRoutes`` returns up to 100 results and a ``nextToken`` value if applicable.

    

  
  :type meshName: string
  :param meshName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of the service mesh to list routes in.

    

  
  :type meshOwner: string
  :param meshOwner: 

    The Amazon Web Services IAM account ID of the service mesh owner. If the account ID is not your own, then it's the ID of the account that shared the mesh with your account. For more information about mesh sharing, see `Working with shared meshes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/app-mesh/latest/userguide/sharing.html>`__.

    

  
  :type nextToken: string
  :param nextToken: 

    The ``nextToken`` value returned from a previous paginated ``ListRoutes`` request where ``limit`` was used and the results exceeded the value of that parameter. Pagination continues from the end of the previous results that returned the ``nextToken`` value.

    

  
  :type virtualRouterName: string
  :param virtualRouterName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of the virtual router to list routes in.

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **nextToken** *(string) --*

      - **routes** *(list) --* 

        The list of existing routes for the specified service mesh and virtual router.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          An object that represents a route returned by a list operation.

          
          

          - **arn** *(string) --*

          - **meshName** *(string) --* 

            The name of the service mesh that the route resides in.

            
          

          - **meshOwner** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Web Services IAM account ID of the service mesh owner. If the account ID is not your own, then it's the ID of the account that shared the mesh with your account.

          - **virtualRouterName** *(string) --* 

            The virtual router that the route is associated with.
