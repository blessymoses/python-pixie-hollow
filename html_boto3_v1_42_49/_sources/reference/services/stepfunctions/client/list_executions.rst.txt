.. py:method:: SFN.Client.list_executions(**kwargs)

  

  Lists all executions of a state machine or a Map Run. You can list all executions related to a state machine by specifying a state machine Amazon Resource Name (ARN), or those related to a Map Run by specifying a Map Run ARN. Using this API action, you can also list all `redriven <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/redrive-executions.html>`__ executions.

   

  You can also provide a state machine `alias <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/concepts-state-machine-alias.html>`__ ARN or `version <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/concepts-state-machine-version.html>`__ ARN to list the executions associated with a specific alias or version.

   

  Results are sorted by time, with the most recent execution first.

   

  If ``nextToken`` is returned, there are more results available. The value of ``nextToken`` is a unique pagination token for each page. Make the call again using the returned token to retrieve the next page. Keep all other arguments unchanged. Each pagination token expires after 24 hours. Using an expired pagination token will return an *HTTP 400 InvalidToken* error.

   

  .. note::

    

    This operation is eventually consistent. The results are best effort and may not reflect very recent updates and changes.

    

   

  This API action is not supported by ``EXPRESS`` state machines.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_executions(
        stateMachineArn='string',
        statusFilter='RUNNING'|'SUCCEEDED'|'FAILED'|'TIMED_OUT'|'ABORTED'|'PENDING_REDRIVE',
        maxResults=123,
        nextToken='string',
        mapRunArn='string',
        redriveFilter='REDRIVEN'|'NOT_REDRIVEN'
    )
    
  :type stateMachineArn: string
  :param stateMachineArn: 

    The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the state machine whose executions is listed.

     

    You can specify either a ``mapRunArn`` or a ``stateMachineArn``, but not both.

     

    You can also return a list of executions associated with a specific `alias <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/concepts-state-machine-alias.html>`__ or `version <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/concepts-state-machine-version.html>`__, by specifying an alias ARN or a version ARN in the ``stateMachineArn`` parameter.

    

  
  :type statusFilter: string
  :param statusFilter: 

    If specified, only list the executions whose current execution status matches the given filter.

     

    If you provide a ``PENDING_REDRIVE`` statusFilter, you must specify ``mapRunArn``. For more information, see `Child workflow execution redrive behaviour <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/redrive-map-run.html#redrive-child-workflow-behavior>`__ in the *Step Functions Developer Guide*.

     

    If you provide a stateMachineArn and a ``PENDING_REDRIVE`` statusFilter, the API returns a validation exception.

    

  
  :type maxResults: integer
  :param maxResults: 

    The maximum number of results that are returned per call. You can use ``nextToken`` to obtain further pages of results. The default is 100 and the maximum allowed page size is 1000. A value of 0 uses the default.

     

    This is only an upper limit. The actual number of results returned per call might be fewer than the specified maximum.

    

  
  :type nextToken: string
  :param nextToken: 

    If ``nextToken`` is returned, there are more results available. The value of ``nextToken`` is a unique pagination token for each page. Make the call again using the returned token to retrieve the next page. Keep all other arguments unchanged. Each pagination token expires after 24 hours. Using an expired pagination token will return an *HTTP 400 InvalidToken* error.

    

  
  :type mapRunArn: string
  :param mapRunArn: 

    The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Map Run that started the child workflow executions. If the ``mapRunArn`` field is specified, a list of all of the child workflow executions started by a Map Run is returned. For more information, see `Examining Map Run <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/concepts-examine-map-run.html>`__ in the *Step Functions Developer Guide*.

     

    You can specify either a ``mapRunArn`` or a ``stateMachineArn``, but not both.

    

  
  :type redriveFilter: string
  :param redriveFilter: 

    Sets a filter to list executions based on whether or not they have been redriven.

     

    For a Distributed Map, ``redriveFilter`` sets a filter to list child workflow executions based on whether or not they have been redriven.

     

    If you do not provide a ``redriveFilter``, Step Functions returns a list of both redriven and non-redriven executions.

     

    If you provide a state machine ARN in ``redriveFilter``, the API returns a validation exception.

        - *(dict) --* 

          Contains details about an execution.

          
          

          - **executionArn** *(string) --*

            A name must *not* contain:

             

            
            * white space

          - **status** *(string) --*

          - **mapRunArn** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a Map Run. This field is returned only if ``mapRunArn`` was specified in the ``ListExecutions`` API action. If ``stateMachineArn`` was specified in ``ListExecutions``, the ``mapRunArn`` isn't returned.

            
          

          - **itemCount** *(integer) --* 

            The total number of items processed in a child workflow execution. This field is returned only if ``mapRunArn`` was specified in the ``ListExecutions`` API action. If ``stateMachineArn`` was specified in ``ListExecutions``, the ``itemCount`` field isn't returned.

            
          

          - **stateMachineVersionArn** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the state machine version associated with the execution.

             

            If the state machine execution was started with an unqualified ARN, it returns null.

             

            If the execution was started using a ``stateMachineAliasArn``, both the ``stateMachineAliasArn`` and ``stateMachineVersionArn`` parameters contain the respective values.

            
          

          - **stateMachineAliasArn** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the state machine alias used to start an execution.

             

            If the state machine execution was started with an unqualified ARN or a version ARN, it returns null.

            
          

          - **redriveCount** *(integer) --* 

            The number of times you've redriven an execution. If you have not yet redriven an execution, the ``redriveCount`` is 0. This count is only updated when you successfully redrive an execution.

            
          

          - **redriveDate** *(datetime) --* 

            The date the execution was last redriven.

            
      
    
      

      - **nextToken** *(string) --* 

        If ``nextToken`` is returned, there are more results available. The value of ``nextToken`` is a unique pagination token for each page. Make the call again using the returned token to retrieve the next page. Keep all other arguments unchanged. Each pagination token expires after 24 hours. Using an expired pagination token will return an *HTTP 400 InvalidToken* error.
