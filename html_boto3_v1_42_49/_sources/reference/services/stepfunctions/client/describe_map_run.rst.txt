.. py:method:: SFN.Client.describe_map_run(**kwargs)

  

  Provides information about a Map Run's configuration, progress, and results. If you've `redriven <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/redrive-map-run.html>`__ a Map Run, this API action also returns information about the redrives of that Map Run. For more information, see `Examining Map Run <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/concepts-examine-map-run.html>`__ in the *Step Functions Developer Guide*.
