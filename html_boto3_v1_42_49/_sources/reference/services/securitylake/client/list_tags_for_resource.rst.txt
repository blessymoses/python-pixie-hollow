    **Response Structure**

        - *(dict) --* 

          A *tag* is a label that you can define and associate with Amazon Web Services resources, including certain types of Amazon Security Lake resources. Tags can help you identify, categorize, and manage resources in different ways, such as by owner, environment, or other criteria. You can associate tags with the following types of Security Lake resources: subscribers, and the data lake configuration for your Amazon Web Services account in individual Amazon Web Services Regions.

           

          A resource can have up to 50 tags. Each tag consists of a required *tag key* and an associated *tag value*. A *tag key* is a general label that acts as a category for a more specific tag value. Each tag key must be unique and it can have only one tag value. A *tag value* acts as a descriptor for a tag key. Tag keys and values are case sensitive. They can contain letters, numbers, spaces, or the following symbols: _ . : / = + @ -

          - **key** *(string) --* 

            The name of the tag. This is a general label that acts as a category for a more specific tag value ( ``value``).

            
          

          - **value** *(string) --* 

            The value that’s associated with the specified tag key ( ``key``). This value acts as a descriptor for the tag key. A tag value cannot be null, but it can be an empty string.
