.. py:method:: SecurityLake.Client.tag_resource(**kwargs)

  

  Adds or updates one or more tags that are associated with an Amazon Security Lake resource: a subscriber, or the data lake configuration for your Amazon Web Services account in a particular Amazon Web Services Region. A *tag* is a label that you can define and associate with Amazon Web Services resources. Each tag consists of a required *tag key* and an associated *tag value*. A *tag key* is a general label that acts as a category for a more specific tag value. A *tag value* acts as a descriptor for a tag key. Tags can help you identify, categorize, and manage resources in different ways, such as by owner, environment, or other criteria. For more information, see `Tagging Amazon Security Lake resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/security-lake/latest/userguide/tagging-resources.html>`__ in the *Amazon Security Lake User Guide*.
