.. py:class:: UserNotifications.Client

  A low-level client representing AWS User Notifications
  

  The *User Notifications API Reference* provides descriptions, API request parameters, and the JSON response for each of the User Notifications API actions.

   

  User Notification control plane APIs are currently available in US East (Virginia) - ``us-east-1``.

   

  `GetNotificationEvent <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/notifications/latest/APIReference/API_GetNotificationEvent.html>`__ and `ListNotificationEvents <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/notifications/latest/APIReference/API_ListNotificationEvents.html>`__ APIs are currently available in `commercial partition Regions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/notifications/latest/userguide/supported-regions.html>`__ and only return notifications stored in the same Region in which they're called.

   

  The User Notifications console can only be used in US East (Virginia). Your data however, is stored in each Region chosen as a `notification hub <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/notifications/latest/userguide/notification-hubs.html>`__ in addition to US East (Virginia).

   

  .. note::

    

    For information about descriptions, API request parameters, and the JSON response for email contact related API actions, see the `User Notifications Contacts API Reference Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/notificationscontacts/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html>`__.
