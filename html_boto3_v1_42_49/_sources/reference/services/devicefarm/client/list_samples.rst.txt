    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 

      Represents the result of a list samples request.

      
      

      - **samples** *(list) --* 

        Information about the samples.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          Represents a sample of performance data.

          
          

          - **arn** *(string) --* 

            The sample's ARN.

            
          

          - **type** *(string) --* 

            The sample's type.

             

            Must be one of the following values:

             

            
            * CPU: A CPU sample type. This is expressed as the app processing CPU time (including child processes) as reported by process, as a percentage.
             
            * MEMORY: A memory usage sample type. This is expressed as the total proportional set size of an app process, in kilobytes.
             
            * NATIVE_AVG_DRAWTIME
             
            * NATIVE_FPS
             
            * NATIVE_FRAMES
             
            * NATIVE_MAX_DRAWTIME
             
            * NATIVE_MIN_DRAWTIME
             
            * OPENGL_AVG_DRAWTIME
             
            * OPENGL_FPS
             
            * OPENGL_FRAMES
             
            * OPENGL_MAX_DRAWTIME
             
            * OPENGL_MIN_DRAWTIME
             
            * RX
             
            * RX_RATE: The total number of bytes per second (TCP and UDP) that are sent, by app process.
             
            * THREADS: A threads sample type. This is expressed as the total number of threads per app process.
             
            * TX
             
            * TX_RATE: The total number of bytes per second (TCP and UDP) that are received, by app process.
            

            
          

          - **url** *(string) --* 

            The presigned Amazon S3 URL that can be used with a GET request to download the sample's file.

            
      
    
      

      - **nextToken** *(string) --* 

        If the number of items that are returned is significantly large, this is an identifier that is also returned. It can be used in a subsequent call to this operation to return the next set of items in the list.

        
  
  **Exceptions**
  
  *   :py:class:`DeviceFarm.Client.exceptions.ArgumentException`

  
  *   :py:class:`DeviceFarm.Client.exceptions.NotFoundException`

  
  *   :py:class:`DeviceFarm.Client.exceptions.LimitExceededException`

  
  *   :py:class:`DeviceFarm.Client.exceptions.ServiceAccountException`

  

  **Examples**

  The following example returns information about samples, given a specific Device Farm project.
  ::

    response = client.list_samples(
        # You can get the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the project by using the list-projects CLI command.
        arn='arn:aws:devicefarm:us-west-2:123456789101:project:EXAMPLE-GUID-123-456',
        # A dynamically generated value, used for paginating results.
        nextToken='RW5DdDJkMWYwZjM2MzM2VHVpOHJIUXlDUXlhc2QzRGViYnc9SEXAMPLE',
    )
    
    print(response)

  
  Expected Output:
  ::

    {
        'samples': [
        ],
        'ResponseMetadata': {
            '...': '...',
        },
    }
