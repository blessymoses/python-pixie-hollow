    * ``/aws/changerequest`` This type of OpsItem is used by Change Manager for reviewing and approving or rejecting change requests. 

    .. warning::

      Amazon Web Services Systems Manager Change Manager will no longer be open to new customers starting November 7, 2025. If you would like to use Change Manager, sign up prior to that date. Existing customers can continue to use the service as normal. For more information, see `Amazon Web Services Systems Manager Change Manager availability change <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/change-manager-availability-change.html>`__.

    
    

    

  
  :type OperationalData: dict
  :param OperationalData: 

    Operational data is custom data that provides useful reference details about the OpsItem. For example, you can specify log files, error strings, license keys, troubleshooting tips, or other relevant data. You enter operational data as key-value pairs. The key has a maximum length of 128 characters. The value has a maximum size of 20 KB.
