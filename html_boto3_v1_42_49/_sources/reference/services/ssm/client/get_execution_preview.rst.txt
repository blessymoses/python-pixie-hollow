    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **ExecutionPreviewId** *(string) --* 

        The generated ID for the existing execution preview.

        
      

      - **EndedAt** *(datetime) --* 

        A UTC timestamp indicating when the execution preview operation ended.

        
      

      - **Status** *(string) --* 

        The current status of the execution preview operation.

        
      

      - **StatusMessage** *(string) --* 

        Supplemental information about the current status of the execution preview.

        
      

      - **ExecutionPreview** *(dict) --* 

        Information about the changes that would be made if an execution were run.

        .. note::    This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the     following top level keys will be set: ``Automation``.     If a client receives an unknown member it will     set ``SDK_UNKNOWN_MEMBER`` as the top level key,     which maps to the name or tag of the unknown     member. The structure of ``SDK_UNKNOWN_MEMBER`` is     as follows::

                'SDK_UNKNOWN_MEMBER': {'name': 'UnknownMemberName'}


      
        

        - **Automation** *(dict) --* 

          Information about the changes that would be made if an Automation workflow were run.

          
          

          - **StepPreviews** *(dict) --* 

            Information about the type of impact a runbook step would have on a resource.

             

            
            * ``Mutating``: The runbook step would make changes to the targets through actions that create, modify, or delete resources.
             
            * ``Non_Mutating``: The runbook step would retrieve data about resources but not make changes to them. This category generally includes ``Describe*``, ``List*``, ``Get*``, and similar read-only API actions.
             
            * ``Undetermined``: An undetermined step invokes executions performed by another orchestration service like Lambda, Step Functions, or Amazon Web Services Systems Manager Run Command. An undetermined step might also call a third-party API. Systems Manager Automation doesn't know the outcome of the orchestration processes or third-party API executions, so the results of the steps are undetermined.
