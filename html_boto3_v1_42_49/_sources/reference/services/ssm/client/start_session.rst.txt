.. py:method:: SSM.Client.start_session(**kwargs)

  

  Initiates a connection to a target (for example, a managed node) for a Session Manager session. Returns a URL and token that can be used to open a WebSocket connection for sending input and receiving outputs.

   

  .. note::

    

    Amazon Web Services CLI usage: ``start-session`` is an interactive command that requires the Session Manager plugin to be installed on the client machine making the call. For information, see `Install the Session Manager plugin for the Amazon Web Services CLI <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-working-with-install-plugin.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*.

     

    Amazon Web Services Tools for PowerShell usage: Start-SSMSession isn't currently supported by Amazon Web Services Tools for PowerShell on Windows local machines.

        Target='string',
        DocumentName='string',
        Reason='string',
        Parameters={
            'string': [

  :type DocumentName: string
  :param DocumentName: 

    The name of the SSM document you want to use to define the type of session, input parameters, or preferences for the session. For example, ``SSM-SessionManagerRunShell``. You can call the  GetDocument API to verify the document exists before attempting to start a session. If no document name is provided, a shell to the managed node is launched by default. For more information, see `Start a session <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-working-with-sessions-start.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*.

    

  
  :type Reason: string
  :param Reason: 

    The reason for connecting to the instance. This value is included in the details for the Amazon CloudWatch Events event created when you start the session.

    

  
  :type Parameters: dict
  :param Parameters: 

    The values you want to specify for the parameters defined in the Session document. For more information about these parameters, see `Create a Session Manager preferences document <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/getting-started-create-preferences-cli.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*.

        An encrypted token value containing session and caller information. This token is used to authenticate the connection to the managed node, and is valid only long enough to ensure the connection is successful. Never share your session's token.

        
      

      - **StreamUrl** *(string) --* 

        A URL back to SSM Agent on the managed node that the Session Manager client uses to send commands and receive output from the node. Format: ``wss://ssmmessages.**region**.amazonaws.com/v1/data-channel/**session-id**?stream=(input|output)``

         

        **region** represents the Region identifier for an Amazon Web Services Region supported by Amazon Web Services Systems Manager, such as ``us-east-2`` for the US East (Ohio) Region.
