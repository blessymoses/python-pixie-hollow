.. py:method:: SSM.Client.get_deployable_patch_snapshot_for_instance(**kwargs)

  

  Retrieves the current snapshot for the patch baseline the managed node uses. This API is primarily used by the ``AWS-RunPatchBaseline`` Systems Manager document (SSM document).

   

  .. note::

    

    If you run the command locally, such as with the Command Line Interface (CLI), the system attempts to use your local Amazon Web Services credentials and the operation fails. To avoid this, you can run the command in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager console. Use Run Command, a tool in Amazon Web Services Systems Manager, with an SSM document that enables you to target a managed node with a script or command. For example, run the command using the ``AWS-RunShellScript`` document or the ``AWS-RunPowerShellScript`` document.

  :type InstanceId: string
  :param InstanceId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ID of the managed node for which the appropriate patch snapshot should be retrieved.

    

  
  :type SnapshotId: string
  :param SnapshotId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The snapshot ID provided by the user when running ``AWS-RunPatchBaseline``.

    

  
  :type BaselineOverride: dict
  :param BaselineOverride: 

    Defines the basic information about a patch baseline override.

    

  
    - **OperatingSystem** *(string) --* 

      The operating system rule used by the patch baseline override.

      

    
    - **GlobalFilters** *(dict) --* 

      A set of patch filters, typically used for approval rules.

      

    
      - **PatchFilters** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The set of patch filters that make up the group.

        

      
        - *(dict) --* 

          Defines which patches should be included in a patch baseline.

           

          A patch filter consists of a key and a set of values. The filter key is a patch property. For example, the available filter keys for ``WINDOWS`` are ``PATCH_SET``, ``PRODUCT``, ``PRODUCT_FAMILY``, ``CLASSIFICATION``, and ``MSRC_SEVERITY``.

           

          The filter values define a matching criterion for the patch property indicated by the key. For example, if the filter key is ``PRODUCT`` and the filter values are ``["Office 2013", "Office 2016"]``, then the filter accepts all patches where product name is either "Office 2013" or "Office 2016". The filter values can be exact values for the patch property given as a key, or a wildcard (*), which matches all values.

           

          You can view lists of valid values for the patch properties by running the ``DescribePatchProperties`` command. For information about which patch properties can be used with each major operating system, see  DescribePatchProperties.

          

        
          - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The key for the filter.

          - **Values** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The value for the filter key.

             

            Run the  DescribePatchProperties command to view lists of valid values for each key based on operating system type.

          - **PatchFilterGroup** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The patch filter group that defines the criteria for the rule.

                - **Values** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                  The value for the filter key.

                   

                  Run the  DescribePatchProperties command to view lists of valid values for each key based on operating system type.

            Patch Manager evaluates patch release dates using Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). If the day represented by ``7`` is ``2025-11-16``, patches released between ``2025-11-16T00:00:00Z`` and ``2025-11-16T23:59:59Z`` will be included in the approval.

             

            This parameter is marked as ``Required: No``, but your request must include a value for either ``ApproveAfterDays`` or ``ApproveUntilDate``.

             

            Not supported for Debian Server or Ubuntu Server.

             

            .. warning::

               

              Use caution when setting this value for Windows Server patch baselines. Because patch updates that are replaced by later updates are removed, setting too broad a value for this parameter can result in crucial patches not being installed. For more information, see the **Windows Server** tab in the topic `How security patches are selected <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/patch-manager-selecting-patches.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*.

              

            

          
          - **ApproveUntilDate** *(string) --* 

            The cutoff date for auto approval of released patches. Any patches released on or before this date are installed automatically.

             

            Enter dates in the format ``YYYY-MM-DD``. For example, ``2025-11-16``.

             

            Patch Manager evaluates patch release dates using Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). If you enter the date ``2025-11-16``, patches released between ``2025-11-16T00:00:00Z`` and ``2025-11-16T23:59:59Z`` will be included in the approval.

             

            This parameter is marked as ``Required: No``, but your request must include a value for either ``ApproveUntilDate`` or ``ApproveAfterDays``.
