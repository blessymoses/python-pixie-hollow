.. py:method:: SSM.Client.update_association(**kwargs)

  

  Updates an association. You can update the association name and version, the document version, schedule, parameters, and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) output. When you call ``UpdateAssociation``, the system removes all optional parameters from the request and overwrites the association with null values for those parameters. This is by design. You must specify all optional parameters in the call, even if you are not changing the parameters. This includes the ``Name`` parameter. Before calling this API action, we recommend that you call the  DescribeAssociation API operation and make a note of all optional parameters required for your ``UpdateAssociation`` call.

   

  In order to call this API operation, a user, group, or role must be granted permission to call the  DescribeAssociation API operation. If you don't have permission to call ``DescribeAssociation``, then you receive the following error: ``An error occurred (AccessDeniedException) when calling the UpdateAssociation operation: User: <user_arn> isn't authorized to perform: ssm:DescribeAssociation on resource: <resource_arn>``

   

  .. warning::

     

    When you update an association, the association immediately runs against the specified targets. You can add the ``ApplyOnlyAtCronInterval`` parameter to run the association during the next schedule run.

  :type AssociationId: string
  :param AssociationId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ID of the association you want to update.

    

  
  :type Parameters: dict
  :param Parameters: 

    The parameters you want to update for the association. If you create a parameter using Parameter Store, a tool in Amazon Web Services Systems Manager, you can reference the parameter using ``{{ssm:parameter-name}}``.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    
      - *(list) --* 

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
    


  :type DocumentVersion: string
  :param DocumentVersion: 

    The document version you want update for the association.

     

    .. warning::

       

      State Manager doesn't support running associations that use a new version of a document if that document is shared from another account. State Manager always runs the ``default`` version of a document if shared from another account, even though the Systems Manager console shows that a new version was processed. If you want to run an association using a new version of a document shared form another account, you must set the document version to ``default``.

      

    

  
  :type ScheduleExpression: string
  :param ScheduleExpression: 

    The cron expression used to schedule the association that you want to update.

    

  
  :type OutputLocation: dict
  :param OutputLocation: 

    An S3 bucket where you want to store the results of this request.

    

  
    - **S3Location** *(dict) --* 

      An S3 bucket where you want to store the results of this request.

      

    
      - **OutputS3Region** *(string) --* 

        The Amazon Web Services Region of the S3 bucket.

        

      
      - **OutputS3BucketName** *(string) --* 

        The name of the S3 bucket.

        

      
      - **OutputS3KeyPrefix** *(string) --* 

        The S3 bucket subfolder.

        

      
    
  
  :type Name: string
  :param Name: 

    The name of the SSM Command document or Automation runbook that contains the configuration information for the managed node.

     

    You can specify Amazon Web Services-predefined documents, documents you created, or a document that is shared with you from another account.

     

    For Systems Manager document (SSM document) that are shared with you from other Amazon Web Services accounts, you must specify the complete SSM document ARN, in the following format:

     

    ``arn:aws:ssm:region:account-id:document/document-name``

     

    For example:

     

    ``arn:aws:ssm:us-east-2:12345678912:document/My-Shared-Document``

     

    For Amazon Web Services-predefined documents and SSM documents you created in your account, you only need to specify the document name. For example, ``AWS-ApplyPatchBaseline`` or ``My-Document``.

    

  
  :type Targets: list
  :param Targets: 

    The targets of the association.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      An array of search criteria that targets managed nodes using a key-value pair that you specify.

       

      .. note::

        

        One or more targets must be specified for maintenance window Run Command-type tasks. Depending on the task, targets are optional for other maintenance window task types (Automation, Lambda, and Step Functions). For more information about running tasks that don't specify targets, see `Registering maintenance window tasks without targets <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/maintenance-windows-targetless-tasks.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*.

        

       

      Supported formats include the following.

       

      **For all Systems Manager tools:**

       

      
      * ``Key=tag-key,Values=tag-value-1,tag-value-2``
      

       

      **For Automation and Change Manager:**

       

      
      * ``Key=tag:tag-key,Values=tag-value``
       
      * ``Key=ResourceGroup,Values=resource-group-name``
       
      * ``Key=ParameterValues,Values=value-1,value-2,value-3``
       
      * To target all instances in the Amazon Web Services Region: 

        
        * ``Key=AWS::EC2::Instance,Values=*``
         
        * ``Key=InstanceIds,Values=*``
        

      
      

       

      **For Run Command and Maintenance Windows:**

       

      
      * ``Key=InstanceIds,Values=instance-id-1,instance-id-2,instance-id-3``
       
      * ``Key=tag:tag-key,Values=tag-value-1,tag-value-2``
       
      * ``Key=resource-groups:Name,Values=resource-group-name``
       
      * Additionally, Maintenance Windows support targeting resource types: 

        
        * ``Key=resource-groups:ResourceTypeFilters,Values=resource-type-1,resource-type-2``
        

      
      

       

      **For State Manager:**

       

      
      * ``Key=InstanceIds,Values=instance-id-1,instance-id-2,instance-id-3``
       
      * ``Key=tag:tag-key,Values=tag-value-1,tag-value-2``
       
      * To target all instances in the Amazon Web Services Region: 

        
        * ``Key=InstanceIds,Values=*``
        

      
      

       

      For more information about how to send commands that target managed nodes using ``Key,Value`` parameters, see `Targeting multiple managed nodes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/send-commands-multiple.html#send-commands-targeting>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*.

      

    
      - **Key** *(string) --* 

        User-defined criteria for sending commands that target managed nodes that meet the criteria.

        

      
      - **Values** *(list) --* 

        User-defined criteria that maps to ``Key``. For example, if you specified ``tag:ServerRole``, you could specify ``value:WebServer`` to run a command on instances that include EC2 tags of ``ServerRole,WebServer``.

         

        Depending on the type of target, the maximum number of values for a key might be lower than the global maximum of 50.

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
    
    

  :type AssociationName: string
  :param AssociationName: 

    The name of the association that you want to update.

    

  
  :type AssociationVersion: string
  :param AssociationVersion: 

    This parameter is provided for concurrency control purposes. You must specify the latest association version in the service. If you want to ensure that this request succeeds, either specify ``$LATEST``, or omit this parameter.

    

  
  :type AutomationTargetParameterName: string
  :param AutomationTargetParameterName: 

    Choose the parameter that will define how your automation will branch out. This target is required for associations that use an Automation runbook and target resources by using rate controls. Automation is a tool in Amazon Web Services Systems Manager.

    

  
  :type MaxErrors: string
  :param MaxErrors: 

    The number of errors that are allowed before the system stops sending requests to run the association on additional targets. You can specify either an absolute number of errors, for example 10, or a percentage of the target set, for example 10%. If you specify 3, for example, the system stops sending requests when the fourth error is received. If you specify 0, then the system stops sending requests after the first error is returned. If you run an association on 50 managed nodes and set ``MaxError`` to 10%, then the system stops sending the request when the sixth error is received.

     

    Executions that are already running an association when ``MaxErrors`` is reached are allowed to complete, but some of these executions may fail as well. If you need to ensure that there won't be more than max-errors failed executions, set ``MaxConcurrency`` to 1 so that executions proceed one at a time.

    

  
  :type MaxConcurrency: string
  :param MaxConcurrency: 

    The maximum number of targets allowed to run the association at the same time. You can specify a number, for example 10, or a percentage of the target set, for example 10%. The default value is 100%, which means all targets run the association at the same time.

     

    If a new managed node starts and attempts to run an association while Systems Manager is running ``MaxConcurrency`` associations, the association is allowed to run. During the next association interval, the new managed node will process its association within the limit specified for ``MaxConcurrency``.

    

  
  :type ComplianceSeverity: string
  :param ComplianceSeverity: 

    The severity level to assign to the association.

    

  
  :type SyncCompliance: string
  :param SyncCompliance: 

    The mode for generating association compliance. You can specify ``AUTO`` or ``MANUAL``. In ``AUTO`` mode, the system uses the status of the association execution to determine the compliance status. If the association execution runs successfully, then the association is ``COMPLIANT``. If the association execution doesn't run successfully, the association is ``NON-COMPLIANT``.

     

    In ``MANUAL`` mode, you must specify the ``AssociationId`` as a parameter for the  PutComplianceItems API operation. In this case, compliance data isn't managed by State Manager, a tool in Amazon Web Services Systems Manager. It is managed by your direct call to the  PutComplianceItems API operation.

     

    By default, all associations use ``AUTO`` mode.

    

  
  :type ApplyOnlyAtCronInterval: boolean
  :param ApplyOnlyAtCronInterval: 

    By default, when you update an association, the system runs it immediately after it is updated and then according to the schedule you specified. Specify ``true`` for ``ApplyOnlyAtCronInterval`` if you want the association to run only according to the schedule you specified.

     

    If you chose this option when you created an association and later you edit that association or you make changes to the Automation runbook or SSM document on which that association is based, State Manager applies the association at the next specified cron interval. For example, if you chose the ``Latest`` version of an SSM document when you created an association and you edit the association by choosing a different document version on the Documents page, State Manager applies the association at the next specified cron interval if you previously set ``ApplyOnlyAtCronInterval`` to ``true``. If this option wasn't selected, State Manager immediately runs the association.

     

    For more information, see `Understanding when associations are applied to resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/state-manager-about.html#state-manager-about-scheduling>`__ and `About target updates with Automation runbooks <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/state-manager-about.html#runbook-target-updates>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*.

     

    This parameter isn't supported for rate expressions.

     

    You can reset this parameter. To do so, specify the ``no-apply-only-at-cron-interval`` parameter when you update the association from the command line. This parameter forces the association to run immediately after updating it and according to the interval specified.

    

  
  :type CalendarNames: list
  :param CalendarNames: 

    The names or Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the Change Calendar type documents you want to gate your associations under. The associations only run when that change calendar is open. For more information, see `Amazon Web Services Systems Manager Change Calendar <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-change-calendar>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*.

          * To target all instances in the Amazon Web Services Region: 

            
            * ``Key=InstanceIds,Values=*``
            

          
          

           

          For more information about how to send commands that target managed nodes using ``Key,Value`` parameters, see `Targeting multiple managed nodes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/send-commands-multiple.html#send-commands-targeting>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*.

          

        
          - **Key** *(string) --* 

            User-defined criteria for sending commands that target managed nodes that meet the criteria.

            

          
          - **Values** *(list) --* 

            User-defined criteria that maps to ``Key``. For example, if you specified ``tag:ServerRole``, you could specify ``value:WebServer`` to run a command on instances that include EC2 tags of ``ServerRole,WebServer``.

             

            Depending on the type of target, the maximum number of values for a key might be lower than the global maximum of 50.

            

          
            - *(string) --* 

            
        
        
    
      - **TargetsMaxConcurrency** *(string) --* 

        The maximum number of targets allowed to run this task in parallel. This ``TargetsMaxConcurrency`` takes precedence over the ``StartAutomationExecution:MaxConcurrency`` parameter if both are supplied.

        

      
      - **TargetsMaxErrors** *(string) --* 

        The maximum number of errors that are allowed before the system stops running the automation on additional targets. This ``TargetsMaxErrors`` parameter takes precedence over the ``StartAutomationExecution:MaxErrors`` parameter if both are supplied.

        

      
    

  :type ScheduleOffset: integer
  :param ScheduleOffset: 

    Number of days to wait after the scheduled day to run an association. For example, if you specified a cron schedule of ``cron(0 0 ? * THU#2 *)``, you could specify an offset of 3 to run the association each Sunday after the second Thursday of the month. For more information about cron schedules for associations, see `Reference\: Cron and rate expressions for Systems Manager <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/reference-cron-and-rate-expressions.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*.

     

    .. note::

      

      To use offsets, you must specify the ``ApplyOnlyAtCronInterval`` parameter. This option tells the system not to run an association immediately after you create it.

      

    

  
  :type Duration: integer
  :param Duration: 

    The number of hours the association can run before it is canceled. Duration applies to associations that are currently running, and any pending and in progress commands on all targets. If a target was taken offline for the association to run, it is made available again immediately, without a reboot.

     

    The ``Duration`` parameter applies only when both these conditions are true:

     

    
    * The association for which you specify a duration is cancelable according to the parameters of the SSM command document or Automation runbook associated with this execution.
     
    * The command specifies the ``ApplyOnlyAtCronInterval`` parameter, which means that the association doesn't run immediately after it is updated, but only according to the specified schedule.
    

    

  
  :type TargetMaps: list
  :param TargetMaps: 

    A key-value mapping of document parameters to target resources. Both Targets and TargetMaps can't be specified together.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
        - *(list) --* 

        
          - *(string) --* 

          
      
  


  :type AlarmConfiguration: dict
  :param AlarmConfiguration: 

    The details for the CloudWatch alarm you want to apply to an automation or command.

    

  
    - **IgnorePollAlarmFailure** *(boolean) --* 

      When this value is *true*, your automation or command continues to run in cases where we can’t retrieve alarm status information from CloudWatch. In cases where we successfully retrieve an alarm status of OK or INSUFFICIENT_DATA, the automation or command continues to run, regardless of this value. Default is *false*.

      

    
    - **Alarms** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The name of the CloudWatch alarm specified in the configuration.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        A CloudWatch alarm you apply to an automation or command.

        

      
        - **Name** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The name of your CloudWatch alarm.

            - **OutputS3Region** *(string) --* 

              The Amazon Web Services Region of the S3 bucket.

              
            

            - **OutputS3BucketName** *(string) --* 

              The name of the S3 bucket.

              
            

            - **OutputS3KeyPrefix** *(string) --* 

              The S3 bucket subfolder.

              
        
      
        

        - **LastExecutionDate** *(datetime) --* 

          The date on which the association was last run.

          
        

        - **LastSuccessfulExecutionDate** *(datetime) --* 

          The last date on which the association was successfully run.

          
        

        - **AssociationName** *(string) --* 

          The association name.

          
        

        - **MaxErrors** *(string) --* 

          The number of errors that are allowed before the system stops sending requests to run the association on additional targets. You can specify either an absolute number of errors, for example 10, or a percentage of the target set, for example 10%. If you specify 3, for example, the system stops sending requests when the fourth error is received. If you specify 0, then the system stops sending requests after the first error is returned. If you run an association on 50 managed nodes and set ``MaxError`` to 10%, then the system stops sending the request when the sixth error is received.

           

          Executions that are already running an association when ``MaxErrors`` is reached are allowed to complete, but some of these executions may fail as well. If you need to ensure that there won't be more than max-errors failed executions, set ``MaxConcurrency`` to 1 so that executions proceed one at a time.

          
        

        - **MaxConcurrency** *(string) --* 

          The maximum number of targets allowed to run the association at the same time. You can specify a number, for example 10, or a percentage of the target set, for example 10%. The default value is 100%, which means all targets run the association at the same time.

           

          If a new managed node starts and attempts to run an association while Systems Manager is running ``MaxConcurrency`` associations, the association is allowed to run. During the next association interval, the new managed node will process its association within the limit specified for ``MaxConcurrency``.

          
        

        - **ComplianceSeverity** *(string) --* 

          The severity level that is assigned to the association.

          
        

        - **SyncCompliance** *(string) --* 

          The mode for generating association compliance. You can specify ``AUTO`` or ``MANUAL``. In ``AUTO`` mode, the system uses the status of the association execution to determine the compliance status. If the association execution runs successfully, then the association is ``COMPLIANT``. If the association execution doesn't run successfully, the association is ``NON-COMPLIANT``.

           

          In ``MANUAL`` mode, you must specify the ``AssociationId`` as a parameter for the  PutComplianceItems API operation. In this case, compliance data isn't managed by State Manager, a tool in Amazon Web Services Systems Manager. It is managed by your direct call to the  PutComplianceItems API operation.

           

          By default, all associations use ``AUTO`` mode.

          
        

        - **ApplyOnlyAtCronInterval** *(boolean) --* 

          By default, when you create a new associations, the system runs it immediately after it is created and then according to the schedule you specified. Specify this option if you don't want an association to run immediately after you create it. This parameter isn't supported for rate expressions.

          
        

        - **CalendarNames** *(list) --* 

          The names or Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the Change Calendar type documents your associations are gated under. The associations only run when that change calendar is open. For more information, see `Amazon Web Services Systems Manager Change Calendar <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-change-calendar>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*.

            - **TargetLocationMaxConcurrency** *(string) --* 

              The maximum number of Amazon Web Services Regions and Amazon Web Services accounts allowed to run the Automation concurrently. ``TargetLocationMaxConcurrency`` has a default value of 1.

              
            

            - **TargetLocationMaxErrors** *(string) --* 

              The maximum number of errors allowed before the system stops queueing additional Automation executions for the currently running Automation. ``TargetLocationMaxErrors`` has a default value of 0.
