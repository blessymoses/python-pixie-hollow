  :type OperatingSystem: string
  :param OperatingSystem: 

    Defines the operating system the patch baseline applies to. The default value is ``WINDOWS``.

    

  
  :type Name: string
  :param Name: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of the patch baseline.

    

  
  :type GlobalFilters: dict
  :param GlobalFilters: 

    A set of global filters used to include patches in the baseline.

     

    .. warning::

       

      The ``GlobalFilters`` parameter can be configured only by using the CLI or an Amazon Web Services SDK. It can't be configured from the Patch Manager console, and its value isn't displayed in the console.

      

    

  
    - **PatchFilters** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The set of patch filters that make up the group.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        Defines which patches should be included in a patch baseline.

         

        A patch filter consists of a key and a set of values. The filter key is a patch property. For example, the available filter keys for ``WINDOWS`` are ``PATCH_SET``, ``PRODUCT``, ``PRODUCT_FAMILY``, ``CLASSIFICATION``, and ``MSRC_SEVERITY``.

         

        The filter values define a matching criterion for the patch property indicated by the key. For example, if the filter key is ``PRODUCT`` and the filter values are ``["Office 2013", "Office 2016"]``, then the filter accepts all patches where product name is either "Office 2013" or "Office 2016". The filter values can be exact values for the patch property given as a key, or a wildcard (*), which matches all values.

         

        You can view lists of valid values for the patch properties by running the ``DescribePatchProperties`` command. For information about which patch properties can be used with each major operating system, see  DescribePatchProperties.

        

      
        - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The key for the filter.

           

          Run the  DescribePatchProperties command to view lists of valid keys for each operating system type.

          

        
        - **Values** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The value for the filter key.

           

          Run the  DescribePatchProperties command to view lists of valid values for each key based on operating system type.

          

        
          - *(string) --*

    A set of rules used to include patches in the baseline.

    

  
    - **PatchRules** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The rules that make up the rule group.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        Defines an approval rule for a patch baseline.

        

      
        - **PatchFilterGroup** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The patch filter group that defines the criteria for the rule.

          

        
          - **PatchFilters** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The set of patch filters that make up the group.

            

          
            - *(dict) --* 

              Defines which patches should be included in a patch baseline.

               

              A patch filter consists of a key and a set of values. The filter key is a patch property. For example, the available filter keys for ``WINDOWS`` are ``PATCH_SET``, ``PRODUCT``, ``PRODUCT_FAMILY``, ``CLASSIFICATION``, and ``MSRC_SEVERITY``.

               

              The filter values define a matching criterion for the patch property indicated by the key. For example, if the filter key is ``PRODUCT`` and the filter values are ``["Office 2013", "Office 2016"]``, then the filter accepts all patches where product name is either "Office 2013" or "Office 2016". The filter values can be exact values for the patch property given as a key, or a wildcard (*), which matches all values.

              - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                The key for the filter.

                 

                Run the  DescribePatchProperties command to view lists of valid keys for each operating system type.

                

              
              - **Values** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                The value for the filter key.

                 

                Run the  DescribePatchProperties command to view lists of valid values for each key based on operating system type.

                

              
                - *(string) --* 

                
            
            
        
        
        - **ComplianceLevel** *(string) --* 

          A compliance severity level for all approved patches in a patch baseline.

          

        
        - **ApproveAfterDays** *(integer) --* 

          The number of days after the release date of each patch matched by the rule that the patch is marked as approved in the patch baseline. For example, a value of ``7`` means that patches are approved seven days after they are released.

           

          Patch Manager evaluates patch release dates using Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). If the day represented by ``7`` is ``2025-11-16``, patches released between ``2025-11-16T00:00:00Z`` and ``2025-11-16T23:59:59Z`` will be included in the approval.

           

          This parameter is marked as ``Required: No``, but your request must include a value for either ``ApproveAfterDays`` or ``ApproveUntilDate``.

           

          Not supported for Debian Server or Ubuntu Server.

           

          .. warning::

             

            Use caution when setting this value for Windows Server patch baselines. Because patch updates that are replaced by later updates are removed, setting too broad a value for this parameter can result in crucial patches not being installed. For more information, see the **Windows Server** tab in the topic `How security patches are selected <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/patch-manager-selecting-patches.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*.

            

          

        
        - **ApproveUntilDate** *(string) --* 

          The cutoff date for auto approval of released patches. Any patches released on or before this date are installed automatically.

           

          Enter dates in the format ``YYYY-MM-DD``. For example, ``2025-11-16``.

           

          Patch Manager evaluates patch release dates using Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). If you enter the date ``2025-11-16``, patches released between ``2025-11-16T00:00:00Z`` and ``2025-11-16T23:59:59Z`` will be included in the approval.

           

          This parameter is marked as ``Required: No``, but your request must include a value for either ``ApproveUntilDate`` or ``ApproveAfterDays``.

           

          Not supported for Debian Server or Ubuntu Server.

        - **EnableNonSecurity** *(boolean) --* 

          For managed nodes identified by the approval rule filters, enables a patch baseline to apply non-security updates available in the specified repository. The default value is ``false``. Applies to Linux managed nodes only.

          

        
      
  
  
  :type ApprovedPatches: list
  :param ApprovedPatches: 

    A list of explicitly approved patches for the baseline.

     

    For information about accepted formats for lists of approved patches and rejected patches, see `Package name formats for approved and rejected patch lists <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/patch-manager-approved-rejected-package-name-formats.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type ApprovedPatchesComplianceLevel: string
  :param ApprovedPatchesComplianceLevel: 

    Defines the compliance level for approved patches. When an approved patch is reported as missing, this value describes the severity of the compliance violation. The default value is ``UNSPECIFIED``.

    

  
  :type ApprovedPatchesEnableNonSecurity: boolean
  :param ApprovedPatchesEnableNonSecurity: 

    Indicates whether the list of approved patches includes non-security updates that should be applied to the managed nodes. The default value is ``false``. Applies to Linux managed nodes only.

    

  
  :type RejectedPatches: list
  :param RejectedPatches: 

    A list of explicitly rejected patches for the baseline.

     

    For information about accepted formats for lists of approved patches and rejected patches, see `Package name formats for approved and rejected patch lists <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/patch-manager-approved-rejected-package-name-formats.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type RejectedPatchesAction: string
  :param RejectedPatchesAction: 

    The action for Patch Manager to take on patches included in the ``RejectedPackages`` list.

      ALLOW_AS_DEPENDENCY  

    **Linux and macOS**: A package in the rejected patches list is installed only if it is a dependency of another package. It is considered compliant with the patch baseline, and its status is reported as ``INSTALLED_OTHER``. This is the default action if no option is specified.

     

    **Windows Server**: Windows Server doesn't support the concept of package dependencies. If a package in the rejected patches list and already installed on the node, its status is reported as ``INSTALLED_OTHER``. Any package not already installed on the node is skipped. This is the default action if no option is specified.

      BLOCK  

    **All OSs**: Packages in the rejected patches list, and packages that include them as dependencies, aren't installed by Patch Manager under any circumstances.

     

    State value assignment for patch compliance:

     

    
    * If a package was installed before it was added to the rejected patches list, or is installed outside of Patch Manager afterward, it's considered noncompliant with the patch baseline and its status is reported as ``INSTALLED_REJECTED``.
     
    * If an update attempts to install a dependency package that is now rejected by the baseline, when previous versions of the package were not rejected, the package being updated is reported as ``MISSING`` for ``SCAN`` operations and as ``FAILED`` for ``INSTALL`` operations.
    

    

  
  :type Description: string
  :param Description: 

    A description of the patch baseline.

        The name specified to identify the patch source.

        

      
      - **Products** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The specific operating system versions a patch repository applies to, such as "Ubuntu16.04", "AmazonLinux2016.09", "RedhatEnterpriseLinux7.2" or "Suse12.7". For lists of supported product values, see  PatchFilter.

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
    
      - **Configuration** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The value of the repo configuration.

  :type AvailableSecurityUpdatesComplianceStatus: string
  :param AvailableSecurityUpdatesComplianceStatus: 

    Indicates the status you want to assign to security patches that are available but not approved because they don't meet the installation criteria specified in the patch baseline.

     

    Example scenario: Security patches that you might want installed can be skipped if you have specified a long period to wait after a patch is released before installation. If an update to the patch is released during your specified waiting period, the waiting period for installing the patch starts over. If the waiting period is too long, multiple versions of the patch could be released but never installed.

     

    Supported for Windows Server managed nodes only.

    

  
  :type ClientToken: string
  :param ClientToken: 

    User-provided idempotency token.

    This field is autopopulated if not provided.

  
  :type Tags: list
  :param Tags: 

    Optional metadata that you assign to a resource. Tags enable you to categorize a resource in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, or environment. For example, you might want to tag a patch baseline to identify the severity level of patches it specifies and the operating system family it applies to. In this case, you could specify the following key-value pairs:

     

    
    * ``Key=PatchSeverity,Value=Critical``
     
    * ``Key=OS,Value=Windows``
    

     

    .. note::

      

      To add tags to an existing patch baseline, use the  AddTagsToResource operation.

      

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      Metadata that you assign to your Amazon Web Services resources. Tags enable you to categorize your resources in different ways, for example, by purpose, owner, or environment. In Amazon Web Services Systems Manager, you can apply tags to Systems Manager documents (SSM documents), managed nodes, maintenance windows, parameters, patch baselines, OpsItems, and OpsMetadata.

      

    
      - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The name of the tag.
