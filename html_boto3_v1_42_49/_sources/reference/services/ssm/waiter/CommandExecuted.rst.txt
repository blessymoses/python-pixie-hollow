    **Request Syntax**
    ::

      waiter.wait(
          CommandId='string',
          InstanceId='string',
          PluginName='string',
          WaiterConfig={
              'Delay': 123,
              'MaxAttempts': 123
          }
      )
      
    :type CommandId: string
    :param CommandId: **[REQUIRED]** 

      (Required) The parent command ID of the invocation plugin.

      

    
    :type InstanceId: string
    :param InstanceId: **[REQUIRED]** 

      (Required) The ID of the managed node targeted by the command. A *managed node* can be an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance, edge device, and on-premises server or VM in your hybrid environment that is configured for Amazon Web Services Systems Manager.

      

    
    :type PluginName: string
    :param PluginName: 

      The name of the step for which you want detailed results. If the document contains only one step, you can omit the name and details for that step. If the document contains more than one step, you must specify the name of the step for which you want to view details. Be sure to specify the name of the step, not the name of a plugin like ``aws:RunShellScript``.

       

      To find the ``PluginName``, check the document content and find the name of the step you want details for. Alternatively, use  ListCommandInvocations with the ``CommandId`` and ``Details`` parameters. The ``PluginName`` is the ``Name`` attribute of the ``CommandPlugin`` object in the ``CommandPlugins`` list.

      

    
    :type WaiterConfig: dict
    :param WaiterConfig: 

      A dictionary that provides parameters to control waiting behavior.

      

    
      - **Delay** *(integer) --* 

        The amount of time in seconds to wait between attempts. Default: 5

        

      
      - **MaxAttempts** *(integer) --* 

        The maximum number of attempts to be made. Default: 20

        

      
    
    
    :returns: None
