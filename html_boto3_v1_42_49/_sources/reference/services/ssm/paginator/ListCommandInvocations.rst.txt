      (Optional) The invocations for a specific command ID.

      

    
    :type InstanceId: string
    :param InstanceId: 

      (Optional) The command execution details for a specific managed node ID.

      

    
    :type Filters: list
    :param Filters: 

      (Optional) One or more filters. Use a filter to return a more specific list of results.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        Describes a command filter.

         

        .. note::

          

          A managed node ID can't be specified when a command status is ``Pending`` because the command hasn't run on the node yet.

          

        

      
        - **key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The name of the filter.

           

          .. note::

            

            The ``ExecutionStage`` filter can't be used with the ``ListCommandInvocations`` operation, only with ``ListCommands``.

            

          

        
        - **value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The filter value. Valid values for each filter key are as follows:

           

          
          * **InvokedAfter**: Specify a timestamp to limit your results. For example, specify ``2024-07-07T00:00:00Z`` to see a list of command executions occurring July 7, 2021, and later.
           
          * **InvokedBefore**: Specify a timestamp to limit your results. For example, specify ``2024-07-07T00:00:00Z`` to see a list of command executions from before July 7, 2021.
           
          * **Status**: Specify a valid command status to see a list of all command executions with that status. The status choices depend on the API you call. The status values you can specify for ``ListCommands`` are:

      - *(dict) --* 
        

        - **CommandInvocations** *(list) --* 

          (Optional) A list of all invocations.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            An invocation is a copy of a command sent to a specific managed node. A command can apply to one or more managed nodes. A command invocation applies to one managed node. For example, if a user runs ``SendCommand`` against three managed nodes, then a command invocation is created for each requested managed node ID. A command invocation returns status and detail information about a command you ran.

            
            

            - **CommandId** *(string) --* 

              The command against which this invocation was requested.

              
            

            - **InstanceId** *(string) --* 

              The managed node ID in which this invocation was requested.

              
            

            - **InstanceName** *(string) --* 

              The fully qualified host name of the managed node.

              
            

            - **Comment** *(string) --* 

              User-specified information about the command, such as a brief description of what the command should do.

              
            

            - **DocumentName** *(string) --* 

              The document name that was requested for execution.

              
            

            - **DocumentVersion** *(string) --* 

              The Systems Manager document (SSM document) version.

              
            

            - **RequestedDateTime** *(datetime) --* 

              The time and date the request was sent to this managed node.

              
            

            - **Status** *(string) --* 

              Whether or not the invocation succeeded, failed, or is pending.

              
            

            - **StatusDetails** *(string) --* 

              A detailed status of the command execution for each invocation (each managed node targeted by the command). StatusDetails includes more information than Status because it includes states resulting from error and concurrency control parameters. StatusDetails can show different results than Status. For more information about these statuses, see `Understanding command statuses <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/monitor-commands.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*. StatusDetails can be one of the following values:

               

              
              * Pending: The command hasn't been sent to the managed node.
               
              * In Progress: The command has been sent to the managed node but hasn't reached a terminal state.
               
              * Success: The execution of the command or plugin was successfully completed. This is a terminal state.
               
              * Delivery Timed Out: The command wasn't delivered to the managed node before the delivery timeout expired. Delivery timeouts don't count against the parent command's ``MaxErrors`` limit, but they do contribute to whether the parent command status is Success or Incomplete. This is a terminal state.
               
              * Execution Timed Out: Command execution started on the managed node, but the execution wasn't complete before the execution timeout expired. Execution timeouts count against the ``MaxErrors`` limit of the parent command. This is a terminal state.
               
              * Failed: The command wasn't successful on the managed node. For a plugin, this indicates that the result code wasn't zero. For a command invocation, this indicates that the result code for one or more plugins wasn't zero. Invocation failures count against the ``MaxErrors`` limit of the parent command. This is a terminal state.
               
              * Cancelled: The command was terminated before it was completed. This is a terminal state.
               
              * Undeliverable: The command can't be delivered to the managed node. The managed node might not exist or might not be responding. Undeliverable invocations don't count against the parent command's MaxErrors limit and don't contribute to whether the parent command status is Success or Incomplete. This is a terminal state.
               
              * Terminated: The parent command exceeded its MaxErrors limit and subsequent command invocations were canceled by the system. This is a terminal state.
               
              * Delayed: The system attempted to send the command to the managed node but wasn't successful. The system retries again.
              

              
            

            - **TraceOutput** *(string) --* 

              Gets the trace output sent by the agent.

              
            

            - **StandardOutputUrl** *(string) --* 

              The URL to the plugin's StdOut file in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), if the S3 bucket was defined for the parent command. For an invocation, ``StandardOutputUrl`` is populated if there is just one plugin defined for the command, and the S3 bucket was defined for the command.

              
            

            - **StandardErrorUrl** *(string) --* 

              The URL to the plugin's StdErr file in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), if the S3 bucket was defined for the parent command. For an invocation, ``StandardErrorUrl`` is populated if there is just one plugin defined for the command, and the S3 bucket was defined for the command.

              
            

            - **CommandPlugins** *(list) --* 

              Plugins processed by the command.

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                Describes plugin details.

                
                

                - **Name** *(string) --* 

                  The name of the plugin. Must be one of the following: ``aws:updateAgent``, ``aws:domainjoin``, ``aws:applications``, ``aws:runPowerShellScript``, ``aws:psmodule``, ``aws:cloudWatch``, ``aws:runShellScript``, or ``aws:updateSSMAgent``.

                  
                

                - **Status** *(string) --* 

                  The status of this plugin. You can run a document with multiple plugins.

                  
                

                - **StatusDetails** *(string) --* 

                  A detailed status of the plugin execution. ``StatusDetails`` includes more information than Status because it includes states resulting from error and concurrency control parameters. StatusDetails can show different results than Status. For more information about these statuses, see `Understanding command statuses <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/monitor-commands.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*. StatusDetails can be one of the following values:

                   

                  
                  * Pending: The command hasn't been sent to the managed node.

                  * Success: The execution of the command or plugin was successfully completed. This is a terminal state.
                   
                  * Delivery Timed Out: The command wasn't delivered to the managed node before the delivery timeout expired. Delivery timeouts don't count against the parent command's ``MaxErrors`` limit, but they do contribute to whether the parent command status is Success or Incomplete. This is a terminal state.
                   
                  * Execution Timed Out: Command execution started on the managed node, but the execution wasn't complete before the execution timeout expired. Execution timeouts count against the ``MaxErrors`` limit of the parent command. This is a terminal state.
                   
                  * Failed: The command wasn't successful on the managed node. For a plugin, this indicates that the result code wasn't zero. For a command invocation, this indicates that the result code for one or more plugins wasn't zero. Invocation failures count against the MaxErrors limit of the parent command. This is a terminal state.
                   
                  * Cancelled: The command was terminated before it was completed. This is a terminal state.
                   
                  * Undeliverable: The command can't be delivered to the managed node. The managed node might not exist, or it might not be responding. Undeliverable invocations don't count against the parent command's MaxErrors limit, and they don't contribute to whether the parent command status is Success or Incomplete. This is a terminal state.
                   
                  * Terminated: The parent command exceeded its MaxErrors limit and subsequent command invocations were canceled by the system. This is a terminal state.
