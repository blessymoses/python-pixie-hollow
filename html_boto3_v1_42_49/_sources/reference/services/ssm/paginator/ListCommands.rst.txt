          }
      )
      
    :type CommandId: string
    :param CommandId: 

      (Optional) If provided, lists only the specified command.

      

    
    :type InstanceId: string
    :param InstanceId: 

      (Optional) Lists commands issued against this managed node ID.

       

      .. note::

        

        You can't specify a managed node ID in the same command that you specify ``Status`` = ``Pending``. This is because the command hasn't reached the managed node yet.

        

      

    
    :type Filters: list
    :param Filters: 

      (Optional) One or more filters. Use a filter to return a more specific list of results.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        Describes a command filter.

         

        .. note::

          

          A managed node ID can't be specified when a command status is ``Pending`` because the command hasn't run on the node yet.

          

        

      
        - **key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The name of the filter.

           

          .. note::

            

            The ``ExecutionStage`` filter can't be used with the ``ListCommandInvocations`` operation, only with ``ListCommands``.

            

          

        
        - **value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The filter value. Valid values for each filter key are as follows:

           

          
          * **InvokedAfter**: Specify a timestamp to limit your results. For example, specify ``2024-07-07T00:00:00Z`` to see a list of command executions occurring July 7, 2021, and later.
           
          * **InvokedBefore**: Specify a timestamp to limit your results. For example, specify ``2024-07-07T00:00:00Z`` to see a list of command executions from before July 7, 2021.
           
          * **Status**: Specify a valid command status to see a list of all command executions with that status. The status choices depend on the API you call. The status values you can specify for ``ListCommands`` are: 

            
            * ``Pending``
             
            * ``InProgress``
             
            * ``Success``
             
            * ``Cancelled``
             
            * ``Failed``
             
            * ``TimedOut`` (this includes both Delivery and Execution time outs)
             
            * ``AccessDenied``
             
            * ``DeliveryTimedOut``
             
            * ``ExecutionTimedOut``

            * ``Cancelled``
             
            * ``Failed``
             
            * ``TimedOut`` (this includes both Delivery and Execution time outs)
             
            * ``AccessDenied``
             
            * ``DeliveryTimedOut``
             
            * ``ExecutionTimedOut``
             
            * ``Undeliverable``
             
            * ``InvalidPlatform``
             
            * ``Terminated``
            

          
           
          * **DocumentName**: Specify name of the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager document (SSM document) for which you want to see command execution results. For example, specify ``AWS-RunPatchBaseline`` to see command executions that used this SSM document to perform security patching operations on managed nodes.
           
          * **ExecutionStage**: Specify one of the following values ( ``ListCommands`` operations only): 

            
            * ``Executing``: Returns a list of command executions that are currently still running.
             
            * ``Complete``: Returns a list of command executions that have already completed.
            

          
          

          

        
      
  
    :type PaginationConfig: dict
    :param PaginationConfig: 

      A dictionary that provides parameters to control pagination.

      

    
      - **MaxItems** *(integer) --* 

        The total number of items to return. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified in max-items then a ``NextToken`` will be provided in the output that you can use to resume pagination.

        

      
      - **PageSize** *(integer) --* 

        The size of each page.

        

      
      - **StartingToken** *(string) --* 

        A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previous response.

                For more information about how to send commands that target managed nodes using ``Key,Value`` parameters, see `Targeting multiple managed nodes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/send-commands-multiple.html#send-commands-targeting>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*.

                
                

                - **Key** *(string) --* 

                  User-defined criteria for sending commands that target managed nodes that meet the criteria.

                  
                

                - **Values** *(list) --* 

                  User-defined criteria that maps to ``Key``. For example, if you specified ``tag:ServerRole``, you could specify ``value:WebServer`` to run a command on instances that include EC2 tags of ``ServerRole,WebServer``.

                   

                  Depending on the type of target, the maximum number of values for a key might be lower than the global maximum of 50.

                  
                  

                  - *(string) --*

              The date and time the command was requested.

              
            

            - **Status** *(string) --* 

              The status of the command.

              
            

            - **StatusDetails** *(string) --* 

              A detailed status of the command execution. ``StatusDetails`` includes more information than ``Status`` because it includes states resulting from error and concurrency control parameters. ``StatusDetails`` can show different results than Status. For more information about these statuses, see `Understanding command statuses <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/monitor-commands.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*. StatusDetails can be one of the following values:

               

              
              * Pending: The command hasn't been sent to any managed nodes.
               
              * In Progress: The command has been sent to at least one managed node but hasn't reached a final state on all managed nodes.
               
              * Success: The command successfully ran on all invocations. This is a terminal state.
               
              * Delivery Timed Out: The value of MaxErrors or more command invocations shows a status of Delivery Timed Out. This is a terminal state.
               
              * Execution Timed Out: The value of MaxErrors or more command invocations shows a status of Execution Timed Out. This is a terminal state.
               
              * Failed: The value of MaxErrors or more command invocations shows a status of Failed. This is a terminal state.
               
              * Incomplete: The command was attempted on all managed nodes and one or more invocations doesn't have a value of Success but not enough invocations failed for the status to be Failed. This is a terminal state.
               
              * Cancelled: The command was terminated before it was completed. This is a terminal state.
               
              * Rate Exceeded: The number of managed nodes targeted by the command exceeded the account limit for pending invocations. The system has canceled the command before running it on any managed node. This is a terminal state.
               
              * Delayed: The system attempted to send the command to the managed node but wasn't successful. The system retries again.
              

              
            

            - **OutputS3Region** *(string) --*
