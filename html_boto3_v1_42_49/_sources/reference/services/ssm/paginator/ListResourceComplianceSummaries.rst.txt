                  For State Manager associations, this timestamp represents when the compliance status was captured and reported by the Systems Manager service, not when the underlying association was actually executed on the managed node. To track actual association execution times, use the  DescribeAssociationExecutionTargets command or check the association execution history in the Systems Manager console.
