    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **jobId** *(string) --* 

        The ID of the job.

        
      

      - **status** *(string) --* 

        The current status of the job.

        
      

      - **startTime** *(datetime) --* 

        The time at which the job was started.

        
      

      - **endTime** *(datetime) --* 

        The time at which the job has finished.

        
      

      - **metrics** *(dict) --* 

        Metrics associated with the execution, specifically total records processed, unique IDs generated, and records the execution skipped.

        
        

        - **inputRecords** *(integer) --* 

          The total number of records that were input for processing.

          
        

        - **totalRecordsProcessed** *(integer) --* 

          The total number of records that were processed.

          
        

        - **recordsNotProcessed** *(integer) --* 

          The total number of records that did not get processed.

          
        

        - **deleteRecordsProcessed** *(integer) --* 

          The number of records processed that were marked for deletion in the input file using the DELETE schema mapping field. These are the records to be removed from the ID mapping table.

          
        

        - **totalMappedRecords** *(integer) --* 

          The total number of records that were mapped.

          
        

        - **totalMappedSourceRecords** *(integer) --* 

          The total number of mapped source records.

          
        

        - **totalMappedTargetRecords** *(integer) --* 

          The total number of distinct mapped target records.

          
        

        - **uniqueRecordsLoaded** *(integer) --* 

          The number of de-duplicated processed records across all runs, excluding deletion-related records. Duplicates are determined by the field marked as UNIQUE_ID in your schema mapping. Records sharing the same value in this field are considered duplicates. For example, if you specified "customer_id" as a UNIQUE_ID field and had three records with the same customer_id value, they would count as one unique record in this metric.

          
        

        - **newMappedRecords** *(integer) --* 

          The number of new mapped records.

          
        

        - **newMappedSourceRecords** *(integer) --* 

          The number of new source records mapped.

          
        

        - **newMappedTargetRecords** *(integer) --* 

          The number of new mapped target records.

          
        

        - **newUniqueRecordsLoaded** *(integer) --* 

          The number of new unique records processed in the current job run, after removing duplicates. This metric excludes deletion-related records. Duplicates are determined by the field marked as UNIQUE_ID in your schema mapping. Records sharing the same value in this field are considered duplicates. For example, if your current run processes five new records with the same UNIQUE_ID value, they would count as one new unique record in this metric.

          
        

        - **mappedRecordsRemoved** *(integer) --* 

          The number of mapped records removed.

          
        

        - **mappedSourceRecordsRemoved** *(integer) --* 

          The number of source records removed due to ID mapping.

          
        

        - **mappedTargetRecordsRemoved** *(integer) --* 

          The number of mapped target records removed.

          
    
      

      - **errorDetails** *(dict) --* 

        An object containing an error message, if there was an error.

        
        

        - **errorMessage** *(string) --* 

          The error message from the job, if there is one.

          
    
      

      - **outputSourceConfig** *(list) --* 

        A list of ``OutputSource`` objects.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          An object containing ``KMSArn``, ``outputS3Path``, and ``roleARN``.

          
          

          - **roleArn** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role. Entity Resolution assumes this role to access Amazon Web Services resources on your behalf as part of workflow execution.

            
          

          - **outputS3Path** *(string) --* 

            The S3 path to which Entity Resolution will write the output table.

            
          

          - **KMSArn** *(string) --* 

            Customer KMS ARN for encryption at rest. If not provided, system will use an Entity Resolution managed KMS key.

            
      
    
      

      - **jobType** *(string) --* 

        The job type of the ID mapping job.

         

        A value of ``INCREMENTAL`` indicates that only new or changed data was processed since the last job run. This is the default job type if the workflow was created with an ``incrementalRunConfig``.

         

        A value of ``BATCH`` indicates that all data was processed from the input source, regardless of previous job runs. This is the default job type if the workflow wasn't created with an ``incrementalRunConfig``.

         

        A value of ``DELETE_ONLY`` indicates that only deletion requests from ``BatchDeleteUniqueIds`` were processed.
