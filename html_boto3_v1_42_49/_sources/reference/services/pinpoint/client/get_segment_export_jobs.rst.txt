    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 

      The request succeeded.

      
      

      - **ExportJobsResponse** *(dict) --* 

        Provides information about all the export jobs that are associated with an application or segment. An export job is a job that exports endpoint definitions to a file.

        
        

        - **Item** *(list) --* 

          An array of responses, one for each export job that's associated with the application (Export Jobs resource) or segment (Segment Export Jobs resource).

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            Provides information about the status and settings of a job that exports endpoint definitions to a file. The file can be added directly to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket by using the Amazon Pinpoint API or downloaded directly to a computer by using the Amazon Pinpoint console.

            
            

            - **ApplicationId** *(string) --* 

              The unique identifier for the application that's associated with the export job.

              
            

            - **CompletedPieces** *(integer) --* 

              The number of pieces that were processed successfully (completed) by the export job, as of the time of the request.

            - **CreationDate** *(string) --* 

              The date, in ISO 8601 format, when the export job was created.

              
            

            - **Definition** *(dict) --* 

              The resource settings that apply to the export job.

              
              

              - **RoleArn** *(string) --* 

                The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that authorized Amazon Pinpoint to access the Amazon S3 location where the endpoint definitions were exported to.

                
              

              - **S3UrlPrefix** *(string) --* 

                The URL of the location in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket where the endpoint definitions were exported to. This location is typically a folder that contains multiple files. The URL should be in the following format: s3://bucket-name/folder-name/.

                
              

              - **SegmentId** *(string) --* 

                The identifier for the segment that the endpoint definitions were exported from. If this value isn't present, Amazon Pinpoint exported definitions for all the endpoints that are associated with the application.

                
              

              - **SegmentVersion** *(integer) --*
