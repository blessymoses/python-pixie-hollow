.. py:method:: Glacier.Archive.delete()

  

  This operation deletes an archive from a vault. Subsequent requests to initiate a retrieval of this archive will fail. Archive retrievals that are in progress for this archive ID may or may not succeed according to the following scenarios:

   

  
  * If the archive retrieval job is actively preparing the data for download when Amazon Glacier receives the delete archive request, the archival retrieval operation might fail.
   
  * If the archive retrieval job has successfully prepared the archive for download when Amazon Glacier receives the delete archive request, you will be able to download the output.
  

   

  This operation is idempotent. Attempting to delete an already-deleted archive does not result in an error.

   

  An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions. For more information, see `Access Control Using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/using-iam-with-amazon-glacier.html>`__.
