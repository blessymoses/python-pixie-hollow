.. py:method:: Glacier.Client.abort_multipart_upload(**kwargs)

  

  This operation aborts a multipart upload identified by the upload ID.

   

  After the Abort Multipart Upload request succeeds, you cannot upload any more parts to the multipart upload or complete the multipart upload. Aborting a completed upload fails. However, aborting an already-aborted upload will succeed, for a short time. For more information about uploading a part and completing a multipart upload, see  UploadMultipartPart and  CompleteMultipartUpload.

   

  This operation is idempotent.

   

  An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions. For more information, see `Access Control Using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/using-iam-with-amazon-glacier.html>`__.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.abort_multipart_upload(
        vaultName='string',
        uploadId='string'
    )
    
  :type accountId: string
  :param accountId: 

    The ``AccountId`` value is the AWS account ID of the account that owns the vault. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single ' ``-``' (hyphen), in which case Amazon Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. If you use an account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the ID.

        Note: this parameter is set to "-" bydefault if no value is not specified.

  :param vaultName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of the vault.

    

  
  :type uploadId: string
  :param uploadId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The upload ID of the multipart upload to delete.
