.. py:method:: Glacier.Client.list_multipart_uploads(**kwargs)

  

  This operation lists in-progress multipart uploads for the specified vault. An in-progress multipart upload is a multipart upload that has been initiated by an  InitiateMultipartUpload request, but has not yet been completed or aborted. The list returned in the List Multipart Upload response has no guaranteed order.

   

  The List Multipart Uploads operation supports pagination. By default, this operation returns up to 50 multipart uploads in the response. You should always check the response for a ``marker`` at which to continue the list; if there are no more items the ``marker`` is ``null``. To return a list of multipart uploads that begins at a specific upload, set the ``marker`` request parameter to the value you obtained from a previous List Multipart Upload request. You can also limit the number of uploads returned in the response by specifying the ``limit`` parameter in the request.

   

  Note the difference between this operation and listing parts (  ListParts). The List Multipart Uploads operation lists all multipart uploads for a vault and does not require a multipart upload ID. The List Parts operation requires a multipart upload ID since parts are associated with a single upload.

   

  An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions. For more information, see `Access Control Using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/using-iam-with-amazon-glacier.html>`__.

   

  For conceptual information and the underlying REST API, see `Working with Archives in Amazon Glacier <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/working-with-archives.html>`__ and `List Multipart Uploads <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/api-multipart-list-uploads.html>`__ in the *Amazon Glacier Developer Guide*.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_multipart_uploads(
        vaultName='string',
        marker='string',
        limit='string'
    )
    
  :type accountId: string
  :param accountId: 

    The ``AccountId`` value is the AWS account ID of the account that owns the vault. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single ' ``-``' (hyphen), in which case Amazon Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. If you use an account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the ID.

        Note: this parameter is set to "-" bydefault if no value is not specified.


  
  :type vaultName: string
  :param vaultName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of the vault.

    

  
  :type marker: string
  :param marker: 

    An opaque string used for pagination. This value specifies the upload at which the listing of uploads should begin. Get the marker value from a previous List Uploads response. You need only include the marker if you are continuing the pagination of results started in a previous List Uploads request.

    

  
  :type limit: string
  :param limit: 

    Specifies the maximum number of uploads returned in the response body. If this value is not specified, the List Uploads operation returns up to 50 uploads.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 

      Contains the Amazon Glacier response to your request.

      
      

      - **UploadsList** *(list) --* 

        A list of in-progress multipart uploads.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          A list of in-progress multipart uploads for a vault.

          
          

          - **MultipartUploadId** *(string) --* 

            The ID of a multipart upload.

            
          

          - **VaultARN** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the vault that contains the archive.

            
          

          - **ArchiveDescription** *(string) --* 

            The description of the archive that was specified in the Initiate Multipart Upload request.

            
          

          - **PartSizeInBytes** *(integer) --* 

            The part size, in bytes, specified in the Initiate Multipart Upload request. This is the size of all the parts in the upload except the last part, which may be smaller than this size.

            
          

          - **CreationDate** *(string) --* 

            The UTC time at which the multipart upload was initiated.

            
      
    
      

      - **Marker** *(string) --*
