.. py:method:: Glacier.Account.create_vault(**kwargs)

  

  This operation creates a new vault with the specified name. The name of the vault must be unique within a region for an AWS account. You can create up to 1,000 vaults per account. If you need to create more vaults, contact Amazon Glacier.

   

  You must use the following guidelines when naming a vault.

   

  
  * Names can be between 1 and 255 characters long.
   
  * Allowed characters are a-z, A-Z, 0-9, '_' (underscore), '-' (hyphen), and '.' (period).
  

   

  This operation is idempotent.

   

  An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions. For more information, see `Access Control Using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/using-iam-with-amazon-glacier.html>`__.
