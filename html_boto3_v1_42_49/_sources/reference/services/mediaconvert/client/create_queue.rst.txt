    response = client.create_queue(
        ConcurrentJobs=123,
        Description='string',
        Name='string',
        PricingPlan='ON_DEMAND'|'RESERVED',
        ReservationPlanSettings={
            'Commitment': 'ONE_YEAR',
            'RenewalType': 'AUTO_RENEW'|'EXPIRE',

        }
    )
    
  :type ConcurrentJobs: integer
  :param ConcurrentJobs: Specify the maximum number of jobs your queue can process concurrently. For on-demand queues, the value you enter is constrained by your service quotas for Maximum concurrent jobs, per on-demand queue and Maximum concurrent jobs, per account. For reserved queues, specify the number of jobs you can process concurrently in your reservation plan instead.

  
  :type Description: string
  :param Description: Optional. A description of the queue that you are creating.

  
  :type Name: string
  :param Name: **[REQUIRED]** The name of the queue that you are creating.

  
  :type PricingPlan: string
  :param PricingPlan: Specifies whether the pricing plan for the queue is on-demand or reserved. For on-demand, you pay per minute, billed in increments of .01 minute. For reserved, you pay for the transcoding capacity of the entire queue, regardless of how much or how little you use it. Reserved pricing requires a 12-month commitment. When you use the API to create a queue, the default is on-demand.

  
  :type ReservationPlanSettings: dict
  :param ReservationPlanSettings: Details about the pricing plan for your reserved queue. Required for reserved queues and not applicable to on-demand queues.

  
    - **Commitment** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** The length of the term of your reserved queue pricing plan commitment.

    
    - **RenewalType** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** Specifies whether the term of your reserved queue pricing plan is automatically extended (AUTO_RENEW) or expires (EXPIRE) at the end of the term. When your term is auto renewed, you extend your commitment by 12 months from the auto renew date. You can cancel this commitment.

    
    - **ReservedSlots** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** Specifies the number of reserved transcode slots (RTS) for this queue. The number of RTS determines how many jobs the queue can process in parallel; each RTS can process one job at a time. You can't decrease the number of RTS in your reserved queue. You can increase the number of RTS by extending your existing commitment with a new 12-month commitment for the larger number. The new commitment begins when you purchase the additional capacity. You can't cancel your commitment or revert to your original commitment after you increase the capacity.

    
  
  :type Status: string
  :param Status: Initial state of the queue. If you create a paused queue, then jobs in that queue won't begin.

  
  :type Tags: dict
  :param Tags: The tags that you want to add to the resource. You can tag resources with a key-value pair or with only a key.
