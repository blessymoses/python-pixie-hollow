  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_vpc_connectors(
        MaxResults=123,
        NextToken='string'
    )
    
  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    The maximum number of results to include in each response (result page). It's used for a paginated request.

     

    If you don't specify ``MaxResults``, the request retrieves all available results in a single response.

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    A token from a previous result page. It's used for a paginated request. The request retrieves the next result page. All other parameter values must be identical to the ones that are specified in the initial request.

     

    If you don't specify ``NextToken``, the request retrieves the first result page.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **VpcConnectors** *(list) --* 

        A list of information records for VPC connectors. In a paginated request, the request returns up to ``MaxResults`` records for each call.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          Describes an App Runner VPC connector resource. A VPC connector describes the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) that an App Runner service is associated with, and the subnets and security group that are used.

           

          Multiple revisions of a connector might have the same ``Name`` and different ``Revision`` values.

           

          .. note::

            

            At this time, App Runner supports only one revision per name.

            

          
          

          - **VpcConnectorName** *(string) --* 

            The customer-provided VPC connector name.

            
          

          - **VpcConnectorArn** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of this VPC connector.

            
          

          - **VpcConnectorRevision** *(integer) --* 

            The revision of this VPC connector. It's unique among all the active connectors ( ``"Status": "ACTIVE"``) that share the same ``Name``.

             

            .. note::

              

              At this time, App Runner supports only one revision per name.

              

            
          

          - **Subnets** *(list) --* 

            A list of IDs of subnets that App Runner uses for your service. All IDs are of subnets of a single Amazon VPC.

            
            

            - *(string) --* 
        
          

          - **SecurityGroups** *(list) --* 

            A list of IDs of security groups that App Runner uses for access to Amazon Web Services resources under the specified subnets. If not specified, App Runner uses the default security group of the Amazon VPC. The default security group allows all outbound traffic.

            
            

            - *(string) --* 
        
          

          - **Status** *(string) --* 

            The current state of the VPC connector. If the status of a connector revision is ``INACTIVE``, it was deleted and can't be used. Inactive connector revisions are permanently removed some time after they are deleted.

            
          

          - **CreatedAt** *(datetime) --* 

            The time when the VPC connector was created. It's in Unix time stamp format.

            
          

          - **DeletedAt** *(datetime) --* 

            The time when the VPC connector was deleted. It's in Unix time stamp format.

            
      
    
      

      - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

        The token that you can pass in a subsequent request to get the next result page. It's returned in a paginated request.
