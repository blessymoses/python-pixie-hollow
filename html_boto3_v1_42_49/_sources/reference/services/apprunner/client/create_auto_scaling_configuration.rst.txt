.. py:method:: AppRunner.Client.create_auto_scaling_configuration(**kwargs)

  

  Create an App Runner automatic scaling configuration resource. App Runner requires this resource when you create or update App Runner services and you require non-default auto scaling settings. You can share an auto scaling configuration across multiple services.

   

  Create multiple revisions of a configuration by calling this action multiple times using the same ``AutoScalingConfigurationName``. The call returns incremental ``AutoScalingConfigurationRevision`` values. When you create a service and configure an auto scaling configuration resource, the service uses the latest active revision of the auto scaling configuration by default. You can optionally configure the service to use a specific revision.

   

  Configure a higher ``MinSize`` to increase the spread of your App Runner service over more Availability Zones in the Amazon Web Services Region. The tradeoff is a higher minimal cost.

   

  Configure a lower ``MaxSize`` to control your cost. The tradeoff is lower responsiveness during peak demand.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.create_auto_scaling_configuration(
        AutoScalingConfigurationName='string',
        MaxConcurrency=123,
        MinSize=123,
        MaxSize=123,
        Tags=[
            {
                'Key': 'string',
                'Value': 'string'
            },
        ]
    )
    
  :type AutoScalingConfigurationName: string
  :param AutoScalingConfigurationName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A name for the auto scaling configuration. When you use it for the first time in an Amazon Web Services Region, App Runner creates revision number ``1`` of this name. When you use the same name in subsequent calls, App Runner creates incremental revisions of the configuration.

     

    .. note::

      

      Prior to the release of `Auto scale configuration enhancements <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/latest/relnotes/release-2023-09-22-auto-scale-config.html>`__, the name ``DefaultConfiguration`` was reserved.

       

      This restriction is no longer in place. You can now manage ``DefaultConfiguration`` the same way you manage your custom auto scaling configurations. This means you can do the following with the ``DefaultConfiguration`` that App Runner provides:

       

      
      * Create new revisions of the ``DefaultConfiguration``.
       
      * Delete the revisions of the ``DefaultConfiguration``.
       
      * Delete the auto scaling configuration for which the App Runner ``DefaultConfiguration`` was created.
       
      * If you delete the auto scaling configuration you can create another custom auto scaling configuration with the same ``DefaultConfiguration`` name. The original ``DefaultConfiguration`` resource provided by App Runner remains in your account unless you make changes to it.
      

      

    

  
  :type MaxConcurrency: integer
  :param MaxConcurrency: 

    The maximum number of concurrent requests that you want an instance to process. If the number of concurrent requests exceeds this limit, App Runner scales up your service.

     

    Default: ``100``

    

  
  :type MinSize: integer
  :param MinSize: 

    The minimum number of instances that App Runner provisions for your service. The service always has at least ``MinSize`` provisioned instances. Some of them actively serve traffic. The rest of them (provisioned and inactive instances) are a cost-effective compute capacity reserve and are ready to be quickly activated. You pay for memory usage of all the provisioned instances. You pay for CPU usage of only the active subset.

     

    App Runner temporarily doubles the number of provisioned instances during deployments, to maintain the same capacity for both old and new code.

     

    Default: ``1``

    

  
  :type MaxSize: integer
  :param MaxSize: 

    The maximum number of instances that your service scales up to. At most ``MaxSize`` instances actively serve traffic for your service.

     

    Default: ``25``

    

  
  :type Tags: list
  :param Tags: 

    A list of metadata items that you can associate with your auto scaling configuration resource. A tag is a key-value pair.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      Describes a tag that is applied to an App Runner resource. A tag is a metadata item consisting of a key-value pair.

      

    
      - **Key** *(string) --* 

        The key of the tag.

        

      
      - **Value** *(string) --* 

        The value of the tag.
