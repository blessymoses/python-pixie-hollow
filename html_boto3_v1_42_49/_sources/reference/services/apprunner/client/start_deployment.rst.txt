.. py:method:: AppRunner.Client.start_deployment(**kwargs)

  

  Initiate a manual deployment of the latest commit in a source code repository or the latest image in a source image repository to an App Runner service.

   

  For a source code repository, App Runner retrieves the commit and builds a Docker image. For a source image repository, App Runner retrieves the latest Docker image. In both cases, App Runner then deploys the new image to your service and starts a new container instance.

   

  This is an asynchronous operation. On a successful call, you can use the returned ``OperationId`` and the  ListOperations call to track the operation's progress.
