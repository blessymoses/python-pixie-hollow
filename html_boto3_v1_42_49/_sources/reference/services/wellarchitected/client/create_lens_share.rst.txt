.. py:method:: WellArchitected.Client.create_lens_share(**kwargs)

  

  Create a lens share.

   

  The owner of a lens can share it with other Amazon Web Services accounts, users, an organization, and organizational units (OUs) in the same Amazon Web Services Region. Lenses provided by Amazon Web Services (Amazon Web Services Official Content) cannot be shared.

   

  Shared access to a lens is not removed until the lens invitation is deleted.

   

  If you share a lens with an organization or OU, all accounts in the organization or OU are granted access to the lens.

   

  For more information, see `Sharing a custom lens <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/userguide/lenses-sharing.html>`__ in the *Well-Architected Tool User Guide*.

   

  .. note::

    

    **Disclaimer**

     

    By sharing your custom lenses with other Amazon Web Services accounts, you acknowledge that Amazon Web Services will make your custom lenses available to those other accounts. Those other accounts may continue to access and use your shared custom lenses even if you delete the custom lenses from your own Amazon Web Services account or terminate your Amazon Web Services account.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.create_lens_share(
        LensAlias='string',
        SharedWith='string',
        ClientRequestToken='string'
    )
    
  :type LensAlias: string
  :param LensAlias: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The alias of the lens.

     

    For Amazon Web Services official lenses, this is either the lens alias, such as ``serverless``, or the lens ARN, such as ``arn:aws:wellarchitected:us-east-1::lens/serverless``. Note that some operations (such as ExportLens and CreateLensShare) are not permitted on Amazon Web Services official lenses.

     

    For custom lenses, this is the lens ARN, such as ``arn:aws:wellarchitected:us-west-2:123456789012:lens/0123456789abcdef01234567890abcdef``.

     

    Each lens is identified by its  LensSummary$LensAlias.

    

  
  :type SharedWith: string
  :param SharedWith: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The Amazon Web Services account ID, organization ID, or organizational unit (OU) ID with which the workload, lens, profile, or review template is shared.

    

  
  :type ClientRequestToken: string
  :param ClientRequestToken: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A unique case-sensitive string used to ensure that this request is idempotent (executes only once).

     

    You should not reuse the same token for other requests. If you retry a request with the same client request token and the same parameters after the original request has completed successfully, the result of the original request is returned.

     

    .. warning::

       

      This token is listed as required, however, if you do not specify it, the Amazon Web Services SDKs automatically generate one for you. If you are not using the Amazon Web Services SDK or the CLI, you must provide this token or the request will fail.

      

    This field is autopopulated if not provided.
