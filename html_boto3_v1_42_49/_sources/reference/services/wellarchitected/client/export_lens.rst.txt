.. py:method:: WellArchitected.Client.export_lens(**kwargs)

  Lenses are defined in JSON. For more information, see `JSON format specification <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/userguide/lenses-format-specification.html>`__ in the *Well-Architected Tool User Guide*.

    **Disclaimer**

     

    Do not include or gather personal identifiable information (PII) of end users or other identifiable individuals in or via your custom lenses. If your custom lens or those shared with you and used in your account do include or collect PII you are responsible for: ensuring that the included PII is processed in accordance with applicable law, providing adequate privacy notices, and obtaining necessary consents for processing such data.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.export_lens(
        LensAlias='string',
        LensVersion='string'
    )
    
  :type LensAlias: string
  :param LensAlias: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The alias of the lens.

     

    For Amazon Web Services official lenses, this is either the lens alias, such as ``serverless``, or the lens ARN, such as ``arn:aws:wellarchitected:us-east-1::lens/serverless``. Note that some operations (such as ExportLens and CreateLensShare) are not permitted on Amazon Web Services official lenses.

     

    For custom lenses, this is the lens ARN, such as ``arn:aws:wellarchitected:us-west-2:123456789012:lens/0123456789abcdef01234567890abcdef``.

     

    Each lens is identified by its  LensSummary$LensAlias.
