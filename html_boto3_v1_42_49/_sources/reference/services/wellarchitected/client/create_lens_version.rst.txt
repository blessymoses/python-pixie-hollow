.. py:method:: WellArchitected.Client.create_lens_version(**kwargs)

  

  Create a new lens version.

   

  A lens can have up to 100 versions.

   

  Use this operation to publish a new lens version after you have imported a lens. The ``LensAlias`` is used to identify the lens to be published. The owner of a lens can share the lens with other Amazon Web Services accounts and users in the same Amazon Web Services Region. Only the owner of a lens can delete it.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.create_lens_version(
        LensAlias='string',
        LensVersion='string',
        IsMajorVersion=True|False,
        ClientRequestToken='string'
    )
    
  :type LensAlias: string
  :param LensAlias: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The alias of the lens.

     

    For Amazon Web Services official lenses, this is either the lens alias, such as ``serverless``, or the lens ARN, such as ``arn:aws:wellarchitected:us-east-1::lens/serverless``. Note that some operations (such as ExportLens and CreateLensShare) are not permitted on Amazon Web Services official lenses.

     

    For custom lenses, this is the lens ARN, such as ``arn:aws:wellarchitected:us-west-2:123456789012:lens/0123456789abcdef01234567890abcdef``.

     

    Each lens is identified by its  LensSummary$LensAlias.

    

  
  :type LensVersion: string
  :param LensVersion: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The version of the lens being created.

    

  
  :type IsMajorVersion: boolean
  :param IsMajorVersion: 

    Set to true if this new major lens version.

    

  
  :type ClientRequestToken: string
  :param ClientRequestToken: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A unique case-sensitive string used to ensure that this request is idempotent (executes only once).

     

    You should not reuse the same token for other requests. If you retry a request with the same client request token and the same parameters after the original request has completed successfully, the result of the original request is returned.

     

    .. warning::

       

      This token is listed as required, however, if you do not specify it, the Amazon Web Services SDKs automatically generate one for you. If you are not using the Amazon Web Services SDK or the CLI, you must provide this token or the request will fail.

      

    This field is autopopulated if not provided.
