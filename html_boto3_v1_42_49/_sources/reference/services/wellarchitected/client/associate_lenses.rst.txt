  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.associate_lenses(
        WorkloadId='string',
        LensAliases=[
            'string',
        ]
    )
    
  :type WorkloadId: string
  :param WorkloadId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ID assigned to the workload. This ID is unique within an Amazon Web Services Region.

    

  
  :type LensAliases: list
  :param LensAliases: **[REQUIRED]** 

    List of lens aliases to associate or disassociate with a workload. Up to 10 lenses can be specified.

     

    Identify a lens using its  LensSummary$LensAlias.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

      The alias of the lens.

       

      For Amazon Web Services official lenses, this is either the lens alias, such as ``serverless``, or the lens ARN, such as ``arn:aws:wellarchitected:us-east-1::lens/serverless``. Note that some operations (such as ExportLens and CreateLensShare) are not permitted on Amazon Web Services official lenses.

       

      For custom lenses, this is the lens ARN, such as ``arn:aws:wellarchitected:us-west-2:123456789012:lens/0123456789abcdef01234567890abcdef``.

       

      Each lens is identified by its  LensSummary$LensAlias.
