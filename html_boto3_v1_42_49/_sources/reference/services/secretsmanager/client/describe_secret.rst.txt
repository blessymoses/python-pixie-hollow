    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **ARN** *(string) --* 

        The ARN of the secret.

        
      

      - **Name** *(string) --* 

        The name of the secret.

        
      

      - **Type** *(string) --* 

        The exact string that identifies the partner that holds the external secret. For more information, see `Using Secrets Manager managed external secrets <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/managed-external-secrets.html>`__.

        
      

      - **Description** *(string) --* 

        The description of the secret.

        
      

      - **KmsKeyId** *(string) --* 

        The key ID or alias ARN of the KMS key that Secrets Manager uses to encrypt the secret value. If the secret is encrypted with the Amazon Web Services managed key ``aws/secretsmanager``, this field is omitted. Secrets created using the console use an KMS key ID.

        
      

      - **RotationEnabled** *(boolean) --* 

        Specifies whether automatic rotation is turned on for this secret. If the secret has never been configured for rotation, Secrets Manager returns null.

         

        To turn on rotation, use  RotateSecret. To turn off rotation, use  CancelRotateSecret.

        
      

      - **RotationLambdaARN** *(string) --* 

        The ARN of the Lambda function that Secrets Manager invokes to rotate the secret.

        
      

      - **RotationRules** *(dict) --* 

        The rotation schedule and Lambda function for this secret. If the secret previously had rotation turned on, but it is now turned off, this field shows the previous rotation schedule and rotation function. If the secret never had rotation turned on, this field is omitted.

        
        

        - **AutomaticallyAfterDays** *(integer) --* 

          The number of days between rotations of the secret. You can use this value to check that your secret meets your compliance guidelines for how often secrets must be rotated. If you use this field to set the rotation schedule, Secrets Manager calculates the next rotation date based on the previous rotation. Manually updating the secret value by calling ``PutSecretValue`` or ``UpdateSecret`` is considered a valid rotation.

           

          In ``DescribeSecret`` and ``ListSecrets``, this value is calculated from the rotation schedule after every successful rotation. In ``RotateSecret``, you can set the rotation schedule in ``RotationRules`` with ``AutomaticallyAfterDays`` or ``ScheduleExpression``, but not both. To set a rotation schedule in hours, use ``ScheduleExpression``.

          
        

        - **Duration** *(string) --* 

          The length of the rotation window in hours, for example ``3h`` for a three hour window. Secrets Manager rotates your secret at any time during this window. The window must not extend into the next rotation window or the next UTC day. The window starts according to the ``ScheduleExpression``. If you don't specify a ``Duration``, for a ``ScheduleExpression`` in hours, the window automatically closes after one hour. For a ``ScheduleExpression`` in days, the window automatically closes at the end of the UTC day. For more information, including examples, see `Schedule expressions in Secrets Manager rotation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/rotate-secrets_schedule.html>`__ in the *Secrets Manager Users Guide*.

          
        

        - **ScheduleExpression** *(string) --* 

          A ``cron()`` or ``rate()`` expression that defines the schedule for rotating your secret. Secrets Manager rotation schedules use UTC time zone. Secrets Manager rotates your secret any time during a rotation window.

           

          Secrets Manager ``rate()`` expressions represent the interval in hours or days that you want to rotate your secret, for example ``rate(12 hours)`` or ``rate(10 days)``. You can rotate a secret as often as every four hours. If you use a ``rate()`` expression, the rotation window starts at midnight. For a rate in hours, the default rotation window closes after one hour. For a rate in days, the default rotation window closes at the end of the day. You can set the ``Duration`` to change the rotation window. The rotation window must not extend into the next UTC day or into the next rotation window.

           

          You can use a ``cron()`` expression to create a rotation schedule that is more detailed than a rotation interval. For more information, including examples, see `Schedule expressions in Secrets Manager rotation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/rotate-secrets_schedule.html>`__ in the *Secrets Manager Users Guide*. For a cron expression that represents a schedule in hours, the default rotation window closes after one hour. For a cron expression that represents a schedule in days, the default rotation window closes at the end of the day. You can set the ``Duration`` to change the rotation window. The rotation window must not extend into the next UTC day or into the next rotation window.

          
    
      

      - **ExternalSecretRotationMetadata** *(list) --* 

        The metadata needed to successfully rotate a managed external secret. A list of key value pairs in JSON format specified by the partner. For more information about the required information, see `Managed external secrets partners <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/mes-partners.html>`__.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          The metadata needed to successfully rotate a managed external secret. A list of key value pairs in JSON format specified by the partner. For more information, see `Managed external secret partners <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/mes-partners.html>`__.

          
          

          - **Key** *(string) --* 

            The key that identifies the item.

            
          

          - **Value** *(string) --* 

            The value of the specified item.

            
      
    
      

      - **ExternalSecretRotationRoleArn** *(string) --* 

        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the role that allows Secrets Manager to rotate a secret held by a third-party partner. For more information, see `Security and permissions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/mes-security.html>`__.

        
      

      - **LastRotatedDate** *(datetime) --* 

        The last date and time that Secrets Manager rotated the secret. If the secret isn't configured for rotation or rotation has been disabled, Secrets Manager returns null.

        
      

      - **LastChangedDate** *(datetime) --* 

        The last date and time that this secret was modified in any way.

        
      

      - **LastAccessedDate** *(datetime) --* 

        The date that the secret was last accessed in the Region. This field is omitted if the secret has never been retrieved in the Region.

        
      

      - **DeletedDate** *(datetime) --* 

        The date the secret is scheduled for deletion. If it is not scheduled for deletion, this field is omitted. When you delete a secret, Secrets Manager requires a recovery window of at least 7 days before deleting the secret. Some time after the deleted date, Secrets Manager deletes the secret, including all of its versions.

         

        If a secret is scheduled for deletion, then its details, including the encrypted secret value, is not accessible. To cancel a scheduled deletion and restore access to the secret, use  RestoreSecret.

        
      

      - **NextRotationDate** *(datetime) --* 

        The next rotation is scheduled to occur on or before this date. If the secret isn't configured for rotation or rotation has been disabled, Secrets Manager returns null. If rotation fails, Secrets Manager retries the entire rotation process multiple times. If rotation is unsuccessful, this date may be in the past.

         

        This date represents the latest date that rotation will occur, but it is not an approximate rotation date. In some cases, for example if you turn off automatic rotation and then turn it back on, the next rotation may occur much sooner than this date.

        
      

      - **Tags** *(list) --* 

        The list of tags attached to the secret. To add tags to a secret, use  TagResource. To remove tags, use  UntagResource.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          A structure that contains information about a tag.

          
          

          - **Key** *(string) --* 

            The key identifier, or name, of the tag.

            
          

          - **Value** *(string) --* 

            The string value associated with the key of the tag.

            
      
    
      

      - **VersionIdsToStages** *(dict) --* 

        A list of the versions of the secret that have staging labels attached. Versions that don't have staging labels are considered deprecated and Secrets Manager can delete them.

         

        Secrets Manager uses staging labels to indicate the status of a secret version during rotation. The three staging labels for rotation are:

         

        
        * ``AWSCURRENT``, which indicates the current version of the secret.
         
        * ``AWSPENDING``, which indicates the version of the secret that contains new secret information that will become the next current version when rotation finishes. During rotation, Secrets Manager creates an ``AWSPENDING`` version ID before creating the new secret version. To check if a secret version exists, call  GetSecretValue.
         
        * ``AWSPREVIOUS``, which indicates the previous current version of the secret. You can use this as the *last known good* version.
        

         

        For more information about rotation and staging labels, see `How rotation works <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/rotate-secrets_how.html>`__.

      - **OwningService** *(string) --* 

        The ID of the service that created this secret. For more information, see `Secrets managed by other Amazon Web Services services <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/service-linked-secrets.html>`__.

        
      

      - **CreatedDate** *(datetime) --* 

        The date the secret was created.

        
      

      - **PrimaryRegion** *(string) --* 

        The Region the secret is in. If a secret is replicated to other Regions, the replicas are listed in ``ReplicationStatus``.

        
      

      - **ReplicationStatus** *(list) --* 

        A list of the replicas of this secret and their status:

         

        
        * ``Failed``, which indicates that the replica was not created.
         
        * ``InProgress``, which indicates that Secrets Manager is in the process of creating the replica.
         
        * ``InSync``, which indicates that the replica was created.
        

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          A replication object consisting of a ``RegionReplicationStatus`` object and includes a Region, KMSKeyId, status, and status message.
