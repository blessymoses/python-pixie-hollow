.. py:method:: SecretsManager.Client.update_secret(**kwargs)

  

  Modifies the details of a secret, including metadata and the secret value. To change the secret value, you can also use  PutSecretValue.

   

  To change the rotation configuration of a secret, use  RotateSecret instead.

   

  To change a secret so that it is managed by another service, you need to recreate the secret in that service. See `Secrets Manager secrets managed by other Amazon Web Services services <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/service-linked-secrets.html>`__.

   

  We recommend you avoid calling ``UpdateSecret`` at a sustained rate of more than once every 10 minutes. When you call ``UpdateSecret`` to update the secret value, Secrets Manager creates a new version of the secret. Secrets Manager removes outdated versions when there are more than 100, but it does not remove versions created less than 24 hours ago. If you update the secret value more than once every 10 minutes, you create more versions than Secrets Manager removes, and you will reach the quota for secret versions.

   

  If you include ``SecretString`` or ``SecretBinary`` to create a new secret version, Secrets Manager automatically moves the staging label ``AWSCURRENT`` to the new version. Then it attaches the label ``AWSPREVIOUS`` to the version that ``AWSCURRENT`` was removed from.

   

  If you call this operation with a ``ClientRequestToken`` that matches an existing version's ``VersionId``, the operation results in an error. You can't modify an existing version, you can only create a new version. To remove a version, remove all staging labels from it. See  UpdateSecretVersionStage.

   

  Secrets Manager generates a CloudTrail log entry when you call this action. Do not include sensitive information in request parameters except ``SecretBinary`` or ``SecretString`` because it might be logged. For more information, see `Logging Secrets Manager events with CloudTrail <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/retrieve-ct-entries.html>`__.

   

  **Required permissions:** ``secretsmanager:UpdateSecret``. For more information, see `IAM policy actions for Secrets Manager <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/reference_iam-permissions.html#reference_iam-permissions_actions>`__ and `Authentication and access control in Secrets Manager <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/auth-and-access.html>`__. If you use a customer managed key, you must also have ``kms:GenerateDataKey``, ``kms:Encrypt``, and ``kms:Decrypt`` permissions on the key. If you change the KMS key and you don't have ``kms:Encrypt`` permission to the new key, Secrets Manager does not re-encrypt existing secret versions with the new key. For more information, see `Secret encryption and decryption <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/security-encryption.html>`__.

   

  .. warning::

     

    When you enter commands in a command shell, there is a risk of the command history being accessed or utilities having access to your command parameters. This is a concern if the command includes the value of a secret. Learn how to `Mitigate the risks of using command-line tools to store Secrets Manager secrets <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/security_cli-exposure-risks.html>`__.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.update_secret(
        SecretId='string',
        ClientRequestToken='string',
        Description='string',
        KmsKeyId='string',
        SecretBinary=b'bytes',
        SecretString='string',
        Type='string'
    )
    
  :type SecretId: string
  :param SecretId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ARN or name of the secret.

     

    For an ARN, we recommend that you specify a complete ARN rather than a partial ARN. See `Finding a secret from a partial ARN <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/troubleshoot.html#ARN_secretnamehyphen>`__.

    

  
  :type ClientRequestToken: string
  :param ClientRequestToken: 

    If you include ``SecretString`` or ``SecretBinary``, then Secrets Manager creates a new version for the secret, and this parameter specifies the unique identifier for the new version.

     

    .. note::

      

      If you use the Amazon Web Services CLI or one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to call this operation, then you can leave this parameter empty. The CLI or SDK generates a random UUID for you and includes it as the value for this parameter in the request.

      

     

    If you generate a raw HTTP request to the Secrets Manager service endpoint, then you must generate a ``ClientRequestToken`` and include it in the request.

     

    This value helps ensure idempotency. Secrets Manager uses this value to prevent the accidental creation of duplicate versions if there are failures and retries during a rotation. We recommend that you generate a `UUID-type <https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier>`__ value to ensure uniqueness of your versions within the specified secret.

    This field is autopopulated if not provided.

  
  :type Description: string
  :param Description: 

    The description of the secret.

    

  
  :type KmsKeyId: string
  :param KmsKeyId: 

    The ARN, key ID, or alias of the KMS key that Secrets Manager uses to encrypt new secret versions as well as any existing versions with the staging labels ``AWSCURRENT``, ``AWSPENDING``, or ``AWSPREVIOUS``. If you don't have ``kms:Encrypt`` permission to the new key, Secrets Manager does not re-encrypt existing secret versions with the new key. For more information about versions and staging labels, see `Concepts\: Version <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/getting-started.html#term_version>`__.

     

    A key alias is always prefixed by ``alias/``, for example ``alias/aws/secretsmanager``. For more information, see `About aliases <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/alias-about.html>`__.

     

    If you set this to an empty string, Secrets Manager uses the Amazon Web Services managed key ``aws/secretsmanager``. If this key doesn't already exist in your account, then Secrets Manager creates it for you automatically. All users and roles in the Amazon Web Services account automatically have access to use ``aws/secretsmanager``. Creating ``aws/secretsmanager`` can result in a one-time significant delay in returning the result.

     

    .. warning::

       

      You can only use the Amazon Web Services managed key ``aws/secretsmanager`` if you call this operation using credentials from the same Amazon Web Services account that owns the secret. If the secret is in a different account, then you must use a customer managed key and provide the ARN of that KMS key in this field. The user making the call must have permissions to both the secret and the KMS key in their respective accounts.

      

    

  
  :type SecretBinary: bytes
  :param SecretBinary: 

    The binary data to encrypt and store in the new version of the secret. We recommend that you store your binary data in a file and then pass the contents of the file as a parameter.

     

    Either ``SecretBinary`` or ``SecretString`` must have a value, but not both.

     

    You can't access this parameter in the Secrets Manager console.

     

    Sensitive: This field contains sensitive information, so the service does not include it in CloudTrail log entries. If you create your own log entries, you must also avoid logging the information in this field.

    

  
  :type SecretString: string
  :param SecretString: 

    The text data to encrypt and store in the new version of the secret. We recommend you use a JSON structure of key/value pairs for your secret value.

     

    Either ``SecretBinary`` or ``SecretString`` must have a value, but not both.

     

    Sensitive: This field contains sensitive information, so the service does not include it in CloudTrail log entries. If you create your own log entries, you must also avoid logging the information in this field.

    

  
  :type Type: string
  :param Type: 

    The exact string that identifies the third-party partner that holds the external secret. For more information, see `Managed external secret partners <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/mes-partners.html>`__.

  **Examples**

  The following example shows how to modify the description of a secret.
  ::

    response = client.update_secret(
        ClientRequestToken='EXAMPLE1-90ab-cdef-fedc-ba987EXAMPLE',
        Description='This is a new description for the secret.',
        SecretId='MyTestDatabaseSecret',
    )
    
    print(response)

  
  Expected Output:
  ::

    {
        'ARN': 'arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:MyTestDatabaseSecret-a1b2c3',
        'Name': 'MyTestDatabaseSecret',
        'ResponseMetadata': {
            '...': '...',
        },
    }

  

  This example shows how to update the KMS customer managed key (CMK) used to encrypt the secret value. The KMS CMK must be in the same region as the secret.
  ::

    response = client.update_secret(
        KmsKeyId='arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:123456789012:key/EXAMPLE2-90ab-cdef-fedc-ba987EXAMPLE',
        SecretId='MyTestDatabaseSecret',
    )
    
    print(response)

  
  Expected Output:
  ::

    {
        'ARN': 'arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:MyTestDatabaseSecret-a1b2c3',
        'Name': 'MyTestDatabaseSecret',
        'ResponseMetadata': {
            '...': '...',
        },
    }

  

  The following example shows how to create a new version of the secret by updating the SecretString field. Alternatively, you can use the put-secret-value operation.
  ::

    response = client.update_secret(
        SecretId='MyTestDatabaseSecret',
        SecretString='{JSON STRING WITH CREDENTIALS}',
    )
    
    print(response)

  
  Expected Output:
  ::

    {
        'ARN': 'aws:arn:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:MyTestDatabaseSecret-a1b2c3',
        'Name': 'MyTestDatabaseSecret',
        'VersionId': 'EXAMPLE1-90ab-cdef-fedc-ba987EXAMPLE',
        'ResponseMetadata': {
            '...': '...',
        },
    }
