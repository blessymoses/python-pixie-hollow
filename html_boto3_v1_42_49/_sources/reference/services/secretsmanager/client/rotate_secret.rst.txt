.. py:method:: SecretsManager.Client.rotate_secret(**kwargs)

  

  Configures and starts the asynchronous process of rotating the secret. For information about rotation, see `Rotate secrets <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/rotating-secrets.html>`__ in the *Secrets Manager User Guide*. If you include the configuration parameters, the operation sets the values for the secret and then immediately starts a rotation. If you don't include the configuration parameters, the operation starts a rotation with the values already stored in the secret.

   

  When rotation is successful, the ``AWSPENDING`` staging label might be attached to the same version as the ``AWSCURRENT`` version, or it might not be attached to any version. If the ``AWSPENDING`` staging label is present but not attached to the same version as ``AWSCURRENT``, then any later invocation of ``RotateSecret`` assumes that a previous rotation request is still in progress and returns an error. When rotation is unsuccessful, the ``AWSPENDING`` staging label might be attached to an empty secret version. For more information, see `Troubleshoot rotation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/troubleshoot_rotation.html>`__ in the *Secrets Manager User Guide*.

   

  Secrets Manager generates a CloudTrail log entry when you call this action. Do not include sensitive information in request parameters because it might be logged. For more information, see `Logging Secrets Manager events with CloudTrail <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/retrieve-ct-entries.html>`__.

   

  **Required permissions:** ``secretsmanager:RotateSecret``. For more information, see `IAM policy actions for Secrets Manager <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/reference_iam-permissions.html#reference_iam-permissions_actions>`__ and `Authentication and access control in Secrets Manager <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/auth-and-access.html>`__. You also need ``lambda:InvokeFunction`` permissions on the rotation function.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.rotate_secret(
        SecretId='string',
        ClientRequestToken='string',
        RotationLambdaARN='string',
        RotationRules={
            'AutomaticallyAfterDays': 123,
            'Duration': 'string',
            'ScheduleExpression': 'string'
        },
        ExternalSecretRotationMetadata=[
            {
                'Key': 'string',
                'Value': 'string'
            },
        ],
        ExternalSecretRotationRoleArn='string',
        RotateImmediately=True|False
    )
    
  :type SecretId: string
  :param SecretId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ARN or name of the secret to rotate.

     

    For an ARN, we recommend that you specify a complete ARN rather than a partial ARN. See `Finding a secret from a partial ARN <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/troubleshoot.html#ARN_secretnamehyphen>`__.

    

  
  :type ClientRequestToken: string
  :param ClientRequestToken: 

    A unique identifier for the new version of the secret. You only need to specify this value if you implement your own retry logic and you want to ensure that Secrets Manager doesn't attempt to create a secret version twice.

     

    .. note::

      

      If you use the Amazon Web Services CLI or one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to call this operation, then you can leave this parameter empty. The CLI or SDK generates a random UUID for you and includes it as the value for this parameter in the request.

      

     

    If you generate a raw HTTP request to the Secrets Manager service endpoint, then you must generate a ``ClientRequestToken`` and include it in the request.

     

    This value helps ensure idempotency. Secrets Manager uses this value to prevent the accidental creation of duplicate versions if there are failures and retries during a rotation. We recommend that you generate a `UUID-type <https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier>`__ value to ensure uniqueness of your versions within the specified secret.

    This field is autopopulated if not provided.

  
  :type RotationLambdaARN: string
  :param RotationLambdaARN: 

    For secrets that use a Lambda rotation function to rotate, the ARN of the Lambda rotation function.

     

    For secrets that use *managed rotation*, omit this field. For more information, see `Managed rotation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/rotate-secrets_managed.html>`__ in the *Secrets Manager User Guide*.

    

  
  :type RotationRules: dict
  :param RotationRules: 

    A structure that defines the rotation configuration for this secret.

     

    .. warning::

       

      When changing an existing rotation schedule and setting ``RotateImmediately`` to ``false``:

       

      
      * If using ``AutomaticallyAfterDays`` or a ``ScheduleExpression`` with ``rate()``, the previously scheduled rotation might still occur.
       
      * To prevent unintended rotations, use a ``ScheduleExpression`` with ``cron()`` for granular control over rotation windows.
      

      

    

  
    - **AutomaticallyAfterDays** *(integer) --* 

      The number of days between rotations of the secret. You can use this value to check that your secret meets your compliance guidelines for how often secrets must be rotated. If you use this field to set the rotation schedule, Secrets Manager calculates the next rotation date based on the previous rotation. Manually updating the secret value by calling ``PutSecretValue`` or ``UpdateSecret`` is considered a valid rotation.

       

      In ``DescribeSecret`` and ``ListSecrets``, this value is calculated from the rotation schedule after every successful rotation. In ``RotateSecret``, you can set the rotation schedule in ``RotationRules`` with ``AutomaticallyAfterDays`` or ``ScheduleExpression``, but not both. To set a rotation schedule in hours, use ``ScheduleExpression``.

      

    
    - **Duration** *(string) --* 

      The length of the rotation window in hours, for example ``3h`` for a three hour window. Secrets Manager rotates your secret at any time during this window. The window must not extend into the next rotation window or the next UTC day. The window starts according to the ``ScheduleExpression``. If you don't specify a ``Duration``, for a ``ScheduleExpression`` in hours, the window automatically closes after one hour. For a ``ScheduleExpression`` in days, the window automatically closes at the end of the UTC day. For more information, including examples, see `Schedule expressions in Secrets Manager rotation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/rotate-secrets_schedule.html>`__ in the *Secrets Manager Users Guide*.

      

    
    - **ScheduleExpression** *(string) --* 

      A ``cron()`` or ``rate()`` expression that defines the schedule for rotating your secret. Secrets Manager rotation schedules use UTC time zone. Secrets Manager rotates your secret any time during a rotation window.

       

      Secrets Manager ``rate()`` expressions represent the interval in hours or days that you want to rotate your secret, for example ``rate(12 hours)`` or ``rate(10 days)``. You can rotate a secret as often as every four hours. If you use a ``rate()`` expression, the rotation window starts at midnight. For a rate in hours, the default rotation window closes after one hour. For a rate in days, the default rotation window closes at the end of the day. You can set the ``Duration`` to change the rotation window. The rotation window must not extend into the next UTC day or into the next rotation window.

       

      You can use a ``cron()`` expression to create a rotation schedule that is more detailed than a rotation interval. For more information, including examples, see `Schedule expressions in Secrets Manager rotation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/rotate-secrets_schedule.html>`__ in the *Secrets Manager Users Guide*. For a cron expression that represents a schedule in hours, the default rotation window closes after one hour. For a cron expression that represents a schedule in days, the default rotation window closes at the end of the day. You can set the ``Duration`` to change the rotation window. The rotation window must not extend into the next UTC day or into the next rotation window.

      

    
  
  :type ExternalSecretRotationMetadata: list
  :param ExternalSecretRotationMetadata: 

    The metadata needed to successfully rotate a managed external secret. A list of key value pairs in JSON format specified by the partner. For more information about the required information, see `Using Secrets Manager managed external secrets <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/managed-external-secrets.html>`__

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      The metadata needed to successfully rotate a managed external secret. A list of key value pairs in JSON format specified by the partner. For more information, see `Managed external secret partners <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/mes-partners.html>`__.

      

    
      - **Key** *(string) --* 

        The key that identifies the item.

        

      
      - **Value** *(string) --* 

        The value of the specified item.

        

      
    

  :type ExternalSecretRotationRoleArn: string
  :param ExternalSecretRotationRoleArn: 

    The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the role that allows Secrets Manager to rotate a secret held by a third-party partner. For more information, see `Security and permissions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/mes-security.html>`__.

    

  
  :type RotateImmediately: boolean
  :param RotateImmediately: 

    Specifies whether to rotate the secret immediately or wait until the next scheduled rotation window. The rotation schedule is defined in  RotateSecretRequest$RotationRules.

     

    The default for ``RotateImmediately`` is ``true``. If you don't specify this value, Secrets Manager rotates the secret immediately.

     

    If you set ``RotateImmediately`` to ``false``, Secrets Manager tests the rotation configuration by running the `testSecret step <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/rotate-secrets_how.html>`__ of the Lambda rotation function. This test creates an ``AWSPENDING`` version of the secret and then removes it.

     

    When changing an existing rotation schedule and setting ``RotateImmediately`` to ``false``:

     

    
    * If using ``AutomaticallyAfterDays`` or a ``ScheduleExpression`` with ``rate()``, the previously scheduled rotation might still occur.
     
    * To prevent unintended rotations, use a ``ScheduleExpression`` with ``cron()`` for granular control over rotation windows.
    

     

    Rotation is an asynchronous process. For more information, see `How rotation works <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/rotate-secrets_how.html>`__.

  **Examples**

  The following example configures rotation for a secret using a cron expression. The first rotation happens immediately after the changes are stored in the secret. The rotation schedule is the first and 15th day of every month. The rotation window begins at 4:00 PM UTC and ends at 6:00 PM.
  ::

    response = client.rotate_secret(
        RotationLambdaARN='arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:function:MyTestDatabaseRotationLambda',
        RotationRules={
            'Duration': '2h',
            'ScheduleExpression': 'cron(0 16 1,15 * ? *)',
        },
        SecretId='MyTestDatabaseSecret',
    )
    
    print(response)

  
  Expected Output:
  ::

    {
        'ARN': 'arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:MyTestDatabaseSecret-a1b2c3',
        'Name': 'MyTestDatabaseSecret',
        'VersionId': 'EXAMPLE2-90ab-cdef-fedc-ba987SECRET2',
        'ResponseMetadata': {
            '...': '...',
        },
    }

  

  The following example requests an immediate invocation of the secret's Lambda rotation function. It assumes that the specified secret already has rotation configured. The rotation function runs asynchronously in the background.
  ::

    response = client.rotate_secret(
        SecretId='MyTestDatabaseSecret',
    )
    
    print(response)

  
  Expected Output:
