    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **scopeId** *(string) --* 

        The identifier for the scope that includes the resources you want to get data results for. A scope ID is an internally-generated identifier that includes all the resources for a specific root account. A scope ID is returned from a ``CreateScope`` API call.

        
      

      - **status** *(string) --* 

        The status for a scope. The status can be one of the following: ``SUCCEEDED``, ``IN_PROGRESS``, ``FAILED``, ``DEACTIVATING``, or ``DEACTIVATED``.

         

        A status of ``DEACTIVATING`` means that you've requested a scope to be deactivated and Network Flow Monitor is in the process of deactivating the scope. A status of ``DEACTIVATED`` means that the deactivating process is complete.

        
      

      - **scopeArn** *(string) --* 

        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the scope.

        
      

      - **targets** *(list) --* 

        The targets to define the scope to be monitored. A target is an array of targetResources, which are currently Region-account pairs, defined by targetResource constructs.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          A target resource in a scope. The resource is identified by a Region and an account, defined by a target identifier. A target identifier is made up of a target ID (currently always an account ID) and a target type (currently always ``ACCOUNT``).

          
          

          - **targetIdentifier** *(dict) --* 

            A target identifier is a pair of identifying information for a scope. A target identifier is made up of a targetID (currently always an account ID) and a targetType (currently always an account).

            
            

            - **targetId** *(dict) --* 

              The identifier for a target, which is currently always an account ID .

              .. note::    This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the     following top level keys will be set: ``accountId``.     If a client receives an unknown member it will     set ``SDK_UNKNOWN_MEMBER`` as the top level key,     which maps to the name or tag of the unknown     member. The structure of ``SDK_UNKNOWN_MEMBER`` is     as follows::

                            'SDK_UNKNOWN_MEMBER': {'name': 'UnknownMemberName'}


            
              

              - **accountId** *(string) --* 

                The identifier for the account for a target.

                
          
            

            - **targetType** *(string) --* 

              The type of a target. A target type is currently always ``ACCOUNT``.
