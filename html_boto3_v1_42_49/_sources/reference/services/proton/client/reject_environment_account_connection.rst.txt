          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the environment account connection.

          
        

        - **codebuildRoleArn** *(string) --* 

          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM service role in the environment account. Proton uses this role to provision infrastructure resources using CodeBuild-based provisioning in the associated environment account.

          
        

        - **componentRoleArn** *(string) --*
