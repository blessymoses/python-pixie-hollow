.. py:method:: Proton.Client.delete_environment_account_connection(**kwargs)

  

  In an environment account, delete an environment account connection.

   

  After you delete an environment account connection that’s in use by an Proton environment, Proton *can’t* manage the environment infrastructure resources until a new environment account connection is accepted for the environment account and associated environment. You're responsible for cleaning up provisioned resources that remain without an environment connection.

   

  For more information, see `Environment account connections <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/userguide/ag-env-account-connections.html>`__ in the *Proton User guide*.

  

  .. danger::

        This operation is deprecated and may not function as expected. This operation should not be used going forward and is only kept for the purpose of backwards compatiblity.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **environmentAccountConnection** *(dict) --* 

        The detailed data of the environment account connection being deleted.

        
        

        - **arn** *(string) --* 

          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the environment account connection.

          
        

        - **codebuildRoleArn** *(string) --* 

          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM service role in the environment account. Proton uses this role to provision infrastructure resources using CodeBuild-based provisioning in the associated environment account.

          
        

        - **componentRoleArn** *(string) --* 

          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM service role that Proton uses when provisioning directly defined components in the associated environment account. It determines the scope of infrastructure that a component can provision in the account.

           

          The environment account connection must have a ``componentRoleArn`` to allow directly defined components to be associated with any environments running in the account.

           

          For more information about components, see `Proton components <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/userguide/ag-components.html>`__ in the *Proton User Guide*.
