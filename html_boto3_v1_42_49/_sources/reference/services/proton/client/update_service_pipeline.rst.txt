.. py:method:: Proton.Client.update_service_pipeline(**kwargs)

  

  Update the service pipeline.

   

  There are four modes for updating a service pipeline. The ``deploymentType`` field defines the mode.

      

  ``NONE``

   

  In this mode, a deployment *doesn't* occur. Only the requested metadata parameters are updated.

      

  ``CURRENT_VERSION``

   

  In this mode, the service pipeline is deployed and updated with the new spec that you provide. Only requested parameters are updated. *Don’t* include major or minor version parameters when you use this ``deployment-type``.

      

  ``MINOR_VERSION``

   

  In this mode, the service pipeline is deployed and updated with the published, recommended (latest) minor version of the current major version in use, by default. You can specify a different minor version of the current major version in use.

      

  ``MAJOR_VERSION``

   

  In this mode, the service pipeline is deployed and updated with the published, recommended (latest) major and minor version of the current template by default. You can specify a different major version that's higher than the major version in use and a minor version.
