.. py:method:: QuickSight.Client.create_account_subscription(**kwargs)

  

  Creates an Amazon Quick Sight account, or subscribes to Amazon Quick Sight Q.

   

  The Amazon Web Services Region for the account is derived from what is configured in the CLI or SDK.

   

  Before you use this operation, make sure that you can connect to an existing Amazon Web Services account. If you don't have an Amazon Web Services account, see `Sign up for Amazon Web Services <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/setting-up-aws-sign-up.html>`__ in the *Amazon Quick Sight User Guide*. The person who signs up for Amazon Quick Sight needs to have the correct Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions. For more information, see `IAM Policy Examples for Amazon Quick Sight <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/iam-policy-examples.html>`__ in the *Amazon Quick Sight User Guide*.

   

  If your IAM policy includes both the ``Subscribe`` and ``CreateAccountSubscription`` actions, make sure that both actions are set to ``Allow``. If either action is set to ``Deny``, the ``Deny`` action prevails and your API call fails.

   

  You can't pass an existing IAM role to access other Amazon Web Services services using this API operation. To pass your existing IAM role to Amazon Quick Sight, see `Passing IAM roles to Amazon Quick Sight <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/security_iam_service-with-iam.html#security-create-iam-role>`__ in the *Amazon Quick Sight User Guide*.

   

  You can't set default resource access on the new account from the Amazon Quick Sight API. Instead, add default resource access from the Amazon Quick Sight console. For more information about setting default resource access to Amazon Web Services services, see `Setting default resource access to Amazon Web Services services <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/scoping-policies-defaults.html>`__ in the *Amazon Quick Sight User Guide*.
