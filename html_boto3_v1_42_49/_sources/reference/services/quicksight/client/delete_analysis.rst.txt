.. py:method:: QuickSight.Client.delete_analysis(**kwargs)

  

  Deletes an analysis from Amazon Quick Sight. You can optionally include a recovery window during which you can restore the analysis. If you don't specify a recovery window value, the operation defaults to 30 days. Amazon Quick Sight attaches a ``DeletionTime`` stamp to the response that specifies the end of the recovery window. At the end of the recovery window, Amazon Quick Sight deletes the analysis permanently.

   

  At any time before recovery window ends, you can use the ``RestoreAnalysis`` API operation to remove the ``DeletionTime`` stamp and cancel the deletion of the analysis. The analysis remains visible in the API until it's deleted, so you can describe it but you can't make a template from it.

   

  An analysis that's scheduled for deletion isn't accessible in the Amazon Quick Sight console. To access it in the console, restore it. Deleting an analysis doesn't delete the dashboards that you publish from it.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.delete_analysis(
        AwsAccountId='string',
        AnalysisId='string',
        RecoveryWindowInDays=123,

  :type AnalysisId: string
  :param AnalysisId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ID of the analysis that you're deleting.

    

  
  :type RecoveryWindowInDays: integer
  :param RecoveryWindowInDays: 

    A value that specifies the number of days that Amazon Quick Sight waits before it deletes the analysis. You can't use this parameter with the ``ForceDeleteWithoutRecovery`` option in the same API call. The default value is 30.

    

  
  :type ForceDeleteWithoutRecovery: boolean
  :param ForceDeleteWithoutRecovery: 

    This option defaults to the value ``NoForceDeleteWithoutRecovery``. To immediately delete the analysis, add the ``ForceDeleteWithoutRecovery`` option. You can't restore an analysis after it's deleted.
