*************************************



.. py:method:: QuickSight.Client.generate_embed_url_for_anonymous_user(**kwargs)

  

  Generates an embed URL that you can use to embed an Amazon Quick Suite dashboard or visual in your website, without having to register any reader users. Before you use this action, make sure that you have configured the dashboards and permissions.

   

  The following rules apply to the generated URL:

   

  
  * It contains a temporary bearer token. It is valid for 5 minutes after it is generated. Once redeemed within this period, it cannot be re-used again.
   
  * The URL validity period should not be confused with the actual session lifetime that can be customized using the ``SessionLifetimeInMinutes`` parameter. The resulting user session is valid for 15 minutes (minimum) to 10 hours (maximum). The default session duration is 10 hours.
   
  * You are charged only when the URL is used or there is interaction with Amazon Quick Suite.
  

   

  For more information, see `Embedded Analytics <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/embedded-analytics.html>`__ in the *Amazon Quick Suite User Guide*.

    )
    
  :type AwsAccountId: string
  :param AwsAccountId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ID for the Amazon Web Services account that contains the dashboard that you're embedding.

    

  
  :type SessionLifetimeInMinutes: integer
  :param SessionLifetimeInMinutes: 

    How many minutes the session is valid. The session lifetime must be in [15-600] minutes range.

    

  
  :type Namespace: string
  :param Namespace: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The Amazon Quick Sight namespace that the anonymous user virtually belongs to. If you are not using an Amazon Quick Suite custom namespace, set this to ``default``.

    

  
  :type SessionTags: list
  :param SessionTags: 

    Session tags are user-specified strings that identify a session in your application. You can use these tags to implement row-level security (RLS) controls. Before you use the ``SessionTags`` parameter, make sure that you have configured the relevant datasets using the ``DataSet$RowLevelPermissionTagConfiguration`` parameter so that session tags can be used to provide row-level security.

     

    When using session tags, you must call ``GenerateEmbedUrlForAnonymousUser`` from a secure, trusted environment. The API call passes session tags that enable server-side data redaction by using the row-level security (RLS) rules configured in your datasets. A secure, trusted environment has access controls that you implement. These controls ensure that only your server or authorized users can add or modify session tags.

     

    Besides, these are not the tags used for the Amazon Web Services resource tagging feature. For more information, see `Using Row-Level Security (RLS) with Tags <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/quicksight-dev-rls-tags.html>`__ in the *Amazon Quick Suite User Guide*.

    If you want to make changes to the theme of your embedded content, pass a list of theme ARNs that the anonymous users need access to.

     

    Currently, you can pass up to 25 theme ARNs in each API call.
