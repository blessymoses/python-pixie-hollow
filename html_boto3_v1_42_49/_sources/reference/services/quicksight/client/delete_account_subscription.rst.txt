  .. warning::

    

    Deleting your Quick Sight account subscription has permanent, irreversible consequences across all Amazon Web Services regions:

     

    
    * Global deletion – Running this operation from any single region will delete your Quick Sight account and all data in every Amazon Web Services region where you have Quick Sight resources.
     
    * Complete data loss – All dashboards, analyses, datasets, data sources, and custom visuals will be permanently deleted across all regions.
     
    * Embedded content failure – All embedded dashboards and visuals in your applications will immediately stop working and display errors to end users.
     
    * Shared resources removed – All shared dashboards, folders, and resources will become inaccessible to other users and external recipients.
     
    * User access terminated – All Quick Sight users in your account will lose access immediately, including authors, readers, and administrators.
     
    * **No recovery possible** – Once deleted, your Quick Sight account and all associated data cannot be restored.
    

     

    Consider exporting critical dashboards and data before proceeding with account deletion.

     

   

  Use the ``DeleteAccountSubscription`` operation to delete an Quick Sight account. This operation will result in an error message if you have configured your account termination protection settings to ``True``. To change this setting and delete your account, call the ``UpdateAccountSettings`` API and set the value of the ``TerminationProtectionEnabled`` parameter to ``False``, then make another call to the ``DeleteAccountSubscription`` API.
