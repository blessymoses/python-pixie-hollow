    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 

      Details about an email identity.

      
      

      - **IdentityType** *(string) --* 

        The email identity type.

        
      

      - **FeedbackForwardingStatus** *(boolean) --* 

        The feedback forwarding configuration for the identity.

         

        If the value is ``true``, Amazon Pinpoint sends you email notifications when bounce or complaint events occur. Amazon Pinpoint sends this notification to the address that you specified in the Return-Path header of the original email.

         

        When you set this value to ``false``, Amazon Pinpoint sends notifications through other mechanisms, such as by notifying an Amazon SNS topic or another event destination. You're required to have a method of tracking bounces and complaints. If you haven't set up another mechanism for receiving bounce or complaint notifications, Amazon Pinpoint sends an email notification when these events occur (even if this setting is disabled).

        
      

      - **VerifiedForSendingStatus** *(boolean) --* 

        Specifies whether or not the identity is verified. In Amazon Pinpoint, you can only send email from verified email addresses or domains. For more information about verifying identities, see the `Amazon Pinpoint User Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/userguide/channels-email-manage-verify.html>`__.

        
      

      - **DkimAttributes** *(dict) --* 

        An object that contains information about the DKIM attributes for the identity. This object includes the tokens that you use to create the CNAME records that are required to complete the DKIM verification process.

        
        

        - **SigningEnabled** *(boolean) --* 

          If the value is ``true``, then the messages that Amazon Pinpoint sends from the identity are DKIM-signed. If the value is ``false``, then the messages that Amazon Pinpoint sends from the identity aren't DKIM-signed.

          
        

        - **Status** *(string) --* 

          Describes whether or not Amazon Pinpoint has successfully located the DKIM records in the DNS records for the domain. The status can be one of the following:

           

          
          * ``PENDING`` – Amazon Pinpoint hasn't yet located the DKIM records in the DNS configuration for the domain, but will continue to attempt to locate them.
           
          * ``SUCCESS`` – Amazon Pinpoint located the DKIM records in the DNS configuration for the domain and determined that they're correct. Amazon Pinpoint can now send DKIM-signed email from the identity.
           
          * ``FAILED`` – Amazon Pinpoint was unable to locate the DKIM records in the DNS settings for the domain, and won't continue to search for them.
           
          * ``TEMPORARY_FAILURE`` – A temporary issue occurred, which prevented Amazon Pinpoint from determining the DKIM status for the domain.
           
          * ``NOT_STARTED`` – Amazon Pinpoint hasn't yet started searching for the DKIM records in the DKIM records for the domain.
          

          
        

        - **Tokens** *(list) --* 

          A set of unique strings that you use to create a set of CNAME records that you add to the DNS configuration for your domain. When Amazon Pinpoint detects these records in the DNS configuration for your domain, the DKIM authentication process is complete. Amazon Pinpoint usually detects these records within about 72 hours of adding them to the DNS configuration for your domain.

          
          

          - *(string) --* 
      
    
      

      - **MailFromAttributes** *(dict) --* 

        An object that contains information about the Mail-From attributes for the email identity.

        
        

        - **MailFromDomain** *(string) --* 

          The name of a domain that an email identity uses as a custom MAIL FROM domain.

          
        

        - **MailFromDomainStatus** *(string) --* 

          The status of the MAIL FROM domain. This status can have the following values:

           

          
          * ``PENDING`` – Amazon Pinpoint hasn't started searching for the MX record yet.
           
          * ``SUCCESS`` – Amazon Pinpoint detected the required MX record for the MAIL FROM domain.
           
          * ``FAILED`` – Amazon Pinpoint can't find the required MX record, or the record no longer exists.
           
          * ``TEMPORARY_FAILURE`` – A temporary issue occurred, which prevented Amazon Pinpoint from determining the status of the MAIL FROM domain.
          

          
        

        - **BehaviorOnMxFailure** *(string) --* 

          The action that Amazon Pinpoint to takes if it can't read the required MX record for a custom MAIL FROM domain. When you set this value to ``UseDefaultValue``, Amazon Pinpoint uses *amazonses.com* as the MAIL FROM domain. When you set this value to ``RejectMessage``, Amazon Pinpoint returns a ``MailFromDomainNotVerified`` error, and doesn't attempt to deliver the email.

           

          These behaviors are taken when the custom MAIL FROM domain configuration is in the ``Pending``, ``Failed``, and ``TemporaryFailure`` states.

          
    
      

      - **Tags** *(list) --* 

        An array of objects that define the tags (keys and values) that are associated with the email identity.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          An object that defines the tags that are associated with a resource. A *tag* is a label that you optionally define and associate with a resource in Amazon Pinpoint. Tags can help you categorize and manage resources in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria. A resource can have as many as 50 tags.

           

          Each tag consists of a required *tag key* and an associated *tag value*, both of which you define. A tag key is a general label that acts as a category for a more specific tag value. A tag value acts as a descriptor within a tag key. A tag key can contain as many as 128 characters. A tag value can contain as many as 256 characters. The characters can be Unicode letters, digits, white space, or one of the following symbols: _ . : / = + -. The following additional restrictions apply to tags:

           

          
          * Tag keys and values are case sensitive.
           
          * For each associated resource, each tag key must be unique and it can have only one value.
           
          * The  ``aws:`` prefix is reserved for use by AWS; you can’t use it in any tag keys or values that you define. In addition, you can't edit or remove tag keys or values that use this prefix. Tags that use this prefix don’t count against the limit of 50 tags per resource.
           
          * You can associate tags with public or shared resources, but the tags are available only for your AWS account, not any other accounts that share the resource. In addition, the tags are available only for resources that are located in the specified AWS Region for your AWS account.
          

          
          

          - **Key** *(string) --* 

            One part of a key-value pair that defines a tag. The maximum length of a tag key is 128 characters. The minimum length is 1 character.

            
          

          - **Value** *(string) --* 

            The optional part of a key-value pair that defines a tag. The maximum length of a tag value is 256 characters. The minimum length is 0 characters. If you don’t want a resource to have a specific tag value, don’t specify a value for this parameter. Amazon Pinpoint will set the value to an empty string.
