.. py:method:: PinpointEmail.Client.send_email(**kwargs)

  

  Sends an email message. You can use the Amazon Pinpoint Email API to send two types of messages:

   

  
  * **Simple** – A standard email message. When you create this type of message, you specify the sender, the recipient, and the message body, and Amazon Pinpoint assembles the message for you.
   
  * **Raw** – A raw, MIME-formatted email message. When you send this type of email, you have to specify all of the message headers, as well as the message body. You can use this message type to send messages that contain attachments. The message that you specify has to be a valid MIME message.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 

      A unique message ID that you receive when Amazon Pinpoint accepts an email for sending.

      
      

      - **MessageId** *(string) --*

        .. note::

          

          It is possible for Amazon Pinpoint to accept a message without sending it. This can happen when the message you're trying to send has an attachment doesn't pass a virus check, or when you send a templated email that contains invalid personalization content, for example.
