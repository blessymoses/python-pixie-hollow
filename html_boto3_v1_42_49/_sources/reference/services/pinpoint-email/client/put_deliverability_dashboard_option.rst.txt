.. py:method:: PinpointEmail.Client.put_deliverability_dashboard_option(**kwargs)

  

  Enable or disable the Deliverability dashboard for your Amazon Pinpoint account. When you enable the Deliverability dashboard, you gain access to reputation, deliverability, and other metrics for the domains that you use to send email using Amazon Pinpoint. You also gain the ability to perform predictive inbox placement tests.

   

  When you use the Deliverability dashboard, you pay a monthly subscription charge, in addition to any other fees that you accrue by using Amazon Pinpoint. For more information about the features and cost of a Deliverability dashboard subscription, see `Amazon Pinpoint Pricing <http://aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/pricing/>`__.
