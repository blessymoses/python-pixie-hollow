.. py:method:: PinpointEmail.Client.list_configuration_sets(**kwargs)

  

  List all of the configuration sets associated with your Amazon Pinpoint account in the current region.

   

  In Amazon Pinpoint, *configuration sets* are groups of rules that you can apply to the emails you send. You apply a configuration set to an email by including a reference to the configuration set in the headers of the email. When you apply a configuration set to an email, all of the rules in that configuration set are applied to the email.
