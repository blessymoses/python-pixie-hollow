.. py:method:: PinpointEmail.Client.get_configuration_set(**kwargs)

  

  Get information about an existing configuration set, including the dedicated IP pool that it's associated with, whether or not it's enabled for sending email, and more.

   

  In Amazon Pinpoint, *configuration sets* are groups of rules that you can apply to the emails you send. You apply a configuration set to an email by including a reference to the configuration set in the headers of the email. When you apply a configuration set to an email, all of the rules in that configuration set are applied to the email.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 

      Information about a configuration set.

      
      

      - **ConfigurationSetName** *(string) --* 

        The name of the configuration set.

        
      

      - **TrackingOptions** *(dict) --* 

        An object that defines the open and click tracking options for emails that you send using the configuration set.

        
        

        - **CustomRedirectDomain** *(string) --* 

          The domain that you want to use for tracking open and click events.

          
    
      

      - **DeliveryOptions** *(dict) --* 

        An object that defines the dedicated IP pool that is used to send emails that you send using the configuration set.

        
        

        - **TlsPolicy** *(string) --* 

          Specifies whether messages that use the configuration set are required to use Transport Layer Security (TLS). If the value is ``Require``, messages are only delivered if a TLS connection can be established. If the value is ``Optional``, messages can be delivered in plain text if a TLS connection can't be established.

          
        

        - **SendingPoolName** *(string) --* 

          The name of the dedicated IP pool that you want to associate with the configuration set.

          
    
      

      - **ReputationOptions** *(dict) --* 

        An object that defines whether or not Amazon Pinpoint collects reputation metrics for the emails that you send that use the configuration set.

        
        

        - **ReputationMetricsEnabled** *(boolean) --* 

          If ``true``, tracking of reputation metrics is enabled for the configuration set. If ``false``, tracking of reputation metrics is disabled for the configuration set.

          
        

        - **LastFreshStart** *(datetime) --* 

          The date and time (in Unix time) when the reputation metrics were last given a fresh start. When your account is given a fresh start, your reputation metrics are calculated starting from the date of the fresh start.

          
    
      

      - **SendingOptions** *(dict) --* 

        An object that defines whether or not Amazon Pinpoint can send email that you send using the configuration set.

        
        

        - **SendingEnabled** *(boolean) --* 

          If ``true``, email sending is enabled for the configuration set. If ``false``, email sending is disabled for the configuration set.

          
    
      

      - **Tags** *(list) --* 

        An array of objects that define the tags (keys and values) that are associated with the configuration set.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          An object that defines the tags that are associated with a resource. A *tag* is a label that you optionally define and associate with a resource in Amazon Pinpoint. Tags can help you categorize and manage resources in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria. A resource can have as many as 50 tags.

           

          Each tag consists of a required *tag key* and an associated *tag value*, both of which you define. A tag key is a general label that acts as a category for a more specific tag value. A tag value acts as a descriptor within a tag key. A tag key can contain as many as 128 characters. A tag value can contain as many as 256 characters. The characters can be Unicode letters, digits, white space, or one of the following symbols: _ . : / = + -. The following additional restrictions apply to tags:

           

          
          * Tag keys and values are case sensitive.
           
          * For each associated resource, each tag key must be unique and it can have only one value.
           
          * The  ``aws:`` prefix is reserved for use by AWS; you can’t use it in any tag keys or values that you define. In addition, you can't edit or remove tag keys or values that use this prefix. Tags that use this prefix don’t count against the limit of 50 tags per resource.
           
          * You can associate tags with public or shared resources, but the tags are available only for your AWS account, not any other accounts that share the resource. In addition, the tags are available only for resources that are located in the specified AWS Region for your AWS account.
          

          
          

          - **Key** *(string) --* 

            One part of a key-value pair that defines a tag. The maximum length of a tag key is 128 characters. The minimum length is 1 character.

            
          

          - **Value** *(string) --* 

            The optional part of a key-value pair that defines a tag. The maximum length of a tag value is 256 characters. The minimum length is 0 characters. If you don’t want a resource to have a specific tag value, don’t specify a value for this parameter. Amazon Pinpoint will set the value to an empty string.
