.. py:method:: BackupSearch.Client.list_search_job_backups(**kwargs)

  

  This operation returns a list of all backups (recovery points) in a paginated format that were included in the search job.

   

  If a search does not display an expected backup in the results, you can call this operation to display each backup included in the search. Any backups that were not included because they have a ``FAILED`` status from a permissions issue will be displayed, along with a status message.

   

  Only recovery points with a backup index that has a status of ``ACTIVE`` will be included in search results. If the index has any other status, its status will be displayed along with a status message.

  ::

    response = client.list_search_job_backups(
        SearchJobIdentifier='string',

    )
    
  :type SearchJobIdentifier: string
  :param SearchJobIdentifier: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The unique string that specifies the search job.

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    The next item following a partial list of returned backups included in a search job.
