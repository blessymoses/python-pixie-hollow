.. py:method:: ACMPCA.Client.put_policy(**kwargs)

  

  Attaches a resource-based policy to a private CA.

   

  A policy can also be applied by sharing a private CA through Amazon Web Services Resource Access Manager (RAM). For more information, see `Attach a Policy for Cross-Account Access <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/pca-ram.html>`__.

   

  The policy can be displayed with `GetPolicy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/API_GetPolicy.html>`__ and removed with `DeletePolicy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/API_DeletePolicy.html>`__.

   

  **About Policies**

   

  
  * A policy grants access on a private CA to an Amazon Web Services customer account, to Amazon Web Services Organizations, or to an Amazon Web Services Organizations unit. Policies are under the control of a CA administrator. For more information, see `Using a Resource Based Policy with Amazon Web Services Private CA <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/pca-rbp.html>`__.
   
  * A policy permits a user of Certificate Manager (ACM) to issue ACM certificates signed by a CA in another account.
   
  * For ACM to manage automatic renewal of these certificates, the ACM user must configure a Service Linked Role (SLR). The SLR allows the ACM service to assume the identity of the user, subject to confirmation against the Amazon Web Services Private CA policy. For more information, see `Using a Service Linked Role with ACM <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-slr.html>`__.
   
  * Updates made in Amazon Web Services Resource Manager (RAM) are reflected in policies. For more information, see `Attach a Policy for Cross-Account Access <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/pca-ram.html>`__.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.put_policy(
        ResourceArn='string',
        Policy='string'
    )
    
  :type ResourceArn: string
  :param ResourceArn: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of the private CA to associate with the policy. The ARN of the CA can be found by calling the `ListCertificateAuthorities <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/API_ListCertificateAuthorities.html>`__ action.

    

  
  :type Policy: string
  :param Policy: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The path and file name of a JSON-formatted IAM policy to attach to the specified private CA resource. If this policy does not contain all required statements or if it includes any statement that is not allowed, the ``PutPolicy`` action returns an ``InvalidPolicyException``. For information about IAM policy and statement structure, see `Overview of JSON Policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#access_policies-json>`__.
