.. py:method:: ACMPCA.Client.update_certificate_authority(**kwargs)

  

  Updates the status or configuration of a private certificate authority (CA). Your private CA must be in the ``ACTIVE`` or ``DISABLED`` state before you can update it. You can disable a private CA that is in the ``ACTIVE`` state or make a CA that is in the ``DISABLED`` state active again.

   

  .. note::

    

    Both Amazon Web Services Private CA and the IAM principal must have permission to write to the S3 bucket that you specify. If the IAM principal making the call does not have permission to write to the bucket, then an exception is thrown. For more information, see `Access policies for CRLs in Amazon S3 <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/crl-planning.html#s3-policies>`__.

    )
    
  :type CertificateAuthorityArn: string
  :param CertificateAuthorityArn: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the private CA that issued the certificate to be revoked. This must be of the form:

     

    ``arn:aws:acm-pca:region:account:certificate-authority/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012``

    

  
  :type RevocationConfiguration: dict
  :param RevocationConfiguration: 

    Contains information to enable support for Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP), certificate revocation list (CRL), both protocols, or neither. If you don't supply this parameter, existing capibilites remain unchanged. For more information, see the `OcspConfiguration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/API_OcspConfiguration.html>`__ and `CrlConfiguration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/API_CrlConfiguration.html>`__ types.

     

    The following requirements apply to revocation configurations.

     

    
    * A configuration disabling CRLs or OCSP must contain only the ``Enabled=False`` parameter, and will fail if other parameters such as ``CustomCname`` or ``ExpirationInDays`` are included.
     
    * In a CRL configuration, the ``S3BucketName`` parameter must conform to `Amazon S3 bucket naming rules <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucketnamingrules.html>`__.
     
    * A configuration containing a custom Canonical Name (CNAME) parameter for CRLs or OCSP must conform to `RFC2396 <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt>`__ restrictions on the use of special characters in a CNAME.
     
    * In a CRL or OCSP configuration, the value of a CNAME parameter must not include a protocol prefix such as "http://" or "https://".
    

     

    .. warning::

       

      If you update the ``S3BucketName`` of `CrlConfiguration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/API_CrlConfiguration.html>`__, you can break revocation for existing certificates. In other words, if you call `UpdateCertificateAuthority <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateCertificateAuthority.html>`__ to update the CRL configuration's S3 bucket name, Amazon Web Services Private CA only writes CRLs to the new S3 bucket. Certificates issued prior to this point will have the old S3 bucket name in your CRL Distribution Point (CDP) extension, essentially breaking revocation. If you must update the S3 bucket, you'll need to reissue old certificates to keep the revocation working. Alternatively, you can use a `CustomCname <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/API_CrlConfiguration.html#privateca-Type-CrlConfiguration-CustomCname>`__ in your CRL configuration if you might need to change the S3 bucket name in the future.

      

    

  
    - **CrlConfiguration** *(dict) --* 

      Configuration of the certificate revocation list (CRL), if any, maintained by your private CA. A CRL is typically updated approximately 30 minutes after a certificate is revoked. If for any reason a CRL update fails, Amazon Web Services Private CA makes further attempts every 15 minutes.

      

    
      - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        Boolean value that specifies whether certificate revocation lists (CRLs) are enabled. You can use this value to enable certificate revocation for a new CA when you call the `CreateCertificateAuthority <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/API_CreateCertificateAuthority.html>`__ action or for an existing CA when you call the `UpdateCertificateAuthority <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateCertificateAuthority.html>`__ action.

        

      
      - **ExpirationInDays** *(integer) --* 

        Validity period of the CRL in days.

        

      
      - **CustomCname** *(string) --* 

        Name inserted into the certificate **CRL Distribution Points** extension that enables the use of an alias for the CRL distribution point. Use this value if you don't want the name of your S3 bucket to be public.

         

        .. note::

          

          The content of a Canonical Name (CNAME) record must conform to `RFC2396 <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt>`__ restrictions on the use of special characters in URIs. Additionally, the value of the CNAME must not include a protocol prefix such as "http://" or "https://".

          

        

      
      - **S3BucketName** *(string) --* 

        Name of the S3 bucket that contains the CRL. If you do not provide a value for the **CustomCname** argument, the name of your S3 bucket is placed into the **CRL Distribution Points** extension of the issued certificate. You can change the name of your bucket by calling the `UpdateCertificateAuthority <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateCertificateAuthority.html>`__ operation. You must specify a `bucket policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/PcaCreateCa.html#s3-policies>`__ that allows Amazon Web Services Private CA to write the CRL to your bucket.

         

        .. note::

          

          The ``S3BucketName`` parameter must conform to the `S3 bucket naming rules <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucketnamingrules.html>`__.

          

        

      
      - **S3ObjectAcl** *(string) --* 

        Determines whether the CRL will be publicly readable or privately held in the CRL Amazon S3 bucket. If you choose PUBLIC_READ, the CRL will be accessible over the public internet. If you choose BUCKET_OWNER_FULL_CONTROL, only the owner of the CRL S3 bucket can access the CRL, and your PKI clients may need an alternative method of access.

         

        If no value is specified, the default is ``PUBLIC_READ``.

         

        *Note:* This default can cause CA creation to fail in some circumstances. If you have have enabled the Block Public Access (BPA) feature in your S3 account, then you must specify the value of this parameter as ``BUCKET_OWNER_FULL_CONTROL``, and not doing so results in an error. If you have disabled BPA in S3, then you can specify either ``BUCKET_OWNER_FULL_CONTROL`` or ``PUBLIC_READ`` as the value.

         

        For more information, see `Blocking public access to the S3 bucket <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/PcaCreateCa.html#s3-bpa>`__.

        

      
      - **CrlDistributionPointExtensionConfiguration** *(dict) --* 

        Configures the behavior of the CRL Distribution Point extension for certificates issued by your certificate authority. If this field is not provided, then the CRl Distribution Point Extension will be present and contain the default CRL URL.

        

      
        - **OmitExtension** *(boolean) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          Configures whether the CRL Distribution Point extension should be populated with the default URL to the CRL. If set to ``true``, then the CDP extension will not be present in any certificates issued by that CA unless otherwise specified through CSR or API passthrough.

           

          .. note::

            

            Only set this if you have another way to distribute the CRL Distribution Points ffor certificates issued by your CA, such as the Matter Distributed Compliance Ledger

             

            This configuration cannot be enabled with a custom CNAME set.

            

          

        
      
      - **CrlType** *(string) --* 

        Specifies whether to create a complete or partitioned CRL. This setting determines the maximum number of certificates that the certificate authority can issue and revoke. For more information, see `Amazon Web Services Private CA quotas <privateca/latest/userguide/pca.html#limits_pca>`__.

         

        
        * ``COMPLETE`` - The default setting. Amazon Web Services Private CA maintains a single CRL ﬁle for all unexpired certiﬁcates issued by a CA that have been revoked for any reason. Each certiﬁcate that Amazon Web Services Private CA issues is bound to a speciﬁc CRL through its CRL distribution point (CDP) extension, deﬁned in `RFC 5280 <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.9>`__.
         
        * ``PARTITIONED`` - Compared to complete CRLs, partitioned CRLs dramatically increase the number of certiﬁcates your private CA can issue. 

        .. warning::

          When using partitioned CRLs, you must validate that the CRL's associated issuing distribution point (IDP) URI matches the certiﬁcate's CDP URI to ensure the right CRL has been fetched. Amazon Web Services Private CA marks the IDP extension as critical, which your client must be able to process.

        
        

        

      
      - **CustomPath** *(string) --* 

        Designates a custom ﬁle path in S3 for CRL(s). For example, ``http://<CustomName>/ <CustomPath>/<CrlPartition_GUID>.crl``.

        

      
    
    - **OcspConfiguration** *(dict) --* 

      Configuration of Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) support, if any, maintained by your private CA. When you revoke a certificate, OCSP responses may take up to 60 minutes to reflect the new status.

      

    
      - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        Flag enabling use of the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) for validating certificate revocation status.

        

      
      - **OcspCustomCname** *(string) --* 

        By default, Amazon Web Services Private CA injects an Amazon Web Services domain into certificates being validated by the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP). A customer can alternatively use this object to define a CNAME specifying a customized OCSP domain.

         

        .. note::

          

          The content of a Canonical Name (CNAME) record must conform to `RFC2396 <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt>`__ restrictions on the use of special characters in URIs. Additionally, the value of the CNAME must not include a protocol prefix such as "http://" or "https://".

          

         

        For more information, see `Customizing Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/ocsp-customize.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services Private Certificate Authority User Guide*.
