.. py:method:: ACMPCA.Client.get_policy(**kwargs)

  

  Retrieves the resource-based policy attached to a private CA. If either the private CA resource or the policy cannot be found, this action returns a ``ResourceNotFoundException``.

   

  The policy can be attached or updated with `PutPolicy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/API_PutPolicy.html>`__ and removed with `DeletePolicy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/API_DeletePolicy.html>`__.

   

  **About Policies**

   

  
  * A policy grants access on a private CA to an Amazon Web Services customer account, to Amazon Web Services Organizations, or to an Amazon Web Services Organizations unit. Policies are under the control of a CA administrator. For more information, see `Using a Resource Based Policy with Amazon Web Services Private CA <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/pca-rbp.html>`__.
   
  * A policy permits a user of Certificate Manager (ACM) to issue ACM certificates signed by a CA in another account.
   
  * For ACM to manage automatic renewal of these certificates, the ACM user must configure a Service Linked Role (SLR). The SLR allows the ACM service to assume the identity of the user, subject to confirmation against the Amazon Web Services Private CA policy. For more information, see `Using a Service Linked Role with ACM <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-slr.html>`__.
   
  * Updates made in Amazon Web Services Resource Manager (RAM) are reflected in policies. For more information, see `Attach a Policy for Cross-Account Access <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/pca-ram.html>`__.
