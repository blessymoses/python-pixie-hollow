.. py:method:: ACMPCA.Client.restore_certificate_authority(**kwargs)

  

  Restores a certificate authority (CA) that is in the ``DELETED`` state. You can restore a CA during the period that you defined in the **PermanentDeletionTimeInDays** parameter of the `DeleteCertificateAuthority <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteCertificateAuthority.html>`__ action. Currently, you can specify 7 to 30 days. If you did not specify a **PermanentDeletionTimeInDays** value, by default you can restore the CA at any time in a 30 day period. You can check the time remaining in the restoration period of a private CA in the ``DELETED`` state by calling the `DescribeCertificateAuthority <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeCertificateAuthority.html>`__ or `ListCertificateAuthorities <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/API_ListCertificateAuthorities.html>`__ actions. The status of a restored CA is set to its pre-deletion status when the **RestoreCertificateAuthority** action returns. To change its status to ``ACTIVE``, call the `UpdateCertificateAuthority <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateCertificateAuthority.html>`__ action. If the private CA was in the ``PENDING_CERTIFICATE`` state at deletion, you must use the `ImportCertificateAuthorityCertificate <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/API_ImportCertificateAuthorityCertificate.html>`__ action to import a certificate authority into the private CA before it can be activated. You cannot restore a CA after the restoration period has ended.
