.. py:method:: ACMPCA.Client.delete_policy(**kwargs)

  

  Deletes the resource-based policy attached to a private CA. Deletion will remove any access that the policy has granted. If there is no policy attached to the private CA, this action will return successful.

   

  If you delete a policy that was applied through Amazon Web Services Resource Access Manager (RAM), the CA will be removed from all shares in which it was included.

   

  The Certificate Manager Service Linked Role that the policy supports is not affected when you delete the policy.

   

  The current policy can be shown with `GetPolicy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/API_GetPolicy.html>`__ and updated with `PutPolicy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/API_PutPolicy.html>`__.

   

  **About Policies**

   

  
  * A policy grants access on a private CA to an Amazon Web Services customer account, to Amazon Web Services Organizations, or to an Amazon Web Services Organizations unit. Policies are under the control of a CA administrator. For more information, see `Using a Resource Based Policy with Amazon Web Services Private CA <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/pca-rbp.html>`__.
   
  * A policy permits a user of Certificate Manager (ACM) to issue ACM certificates signed by a CA in another account.
   
  * For ACM to manage automatic renewal of these certificates, the ACM user must configure a Service Linked Role (SLR). The SLR allows the ACM service to assume the identity of the user, subject to confirmation against the Amazon Web Services Private CA policy. For more information, see `Using a Service Linked Role with ACM <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-slr.html>`__.
   
  * Updates made in Amazon Web Services Resource Manager (RAM) are reflected in policies. For more information, see `Attach a Policy for Cross-Account Access <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/pca-ram.html>`__.
