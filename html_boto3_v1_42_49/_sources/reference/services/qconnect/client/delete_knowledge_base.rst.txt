.. py:method:: QConnect.Client.delete_knowledge_base(**kwargs)

  

  Deletes the knowledge base.

   

  .. note::

    

    When you use this API to delete an external knowledge base such as Salesforce or ServiceNow, you must also delete the `Amazon AppIntegrations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appintegrations/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html>`__ DataIntegration. This is because you can't reuse the DataIntegration after it's been associated with an external knowledge base. However, you can delete and recreate it. See `DeleteDataIntegration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appintegrations/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteDataIntegration.html>`__ and `CreateDataIntegration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appintegrations/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDataIntegration.html>`__ in the *Amazon AppIntegrations API Reference*.
