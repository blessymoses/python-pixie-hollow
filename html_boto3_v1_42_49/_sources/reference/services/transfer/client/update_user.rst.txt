.. py:method:: Transfer.Client.update_user(**kwargs)

  

  Assigns new properties to a user. Parameters you pass modify any or all of the following: the home directory, role, and policy for the ``UserName`` and ``ServerId`` you specify.

   

  The response returns the ``ServerId`` and the ``UserName`` for the updated user.

   

  In the console, you can select *Restricted* when you create or update a user. This ensures that the user can't access anything outside of their home directory. The programmatic way to configure this behavior is to update the user. Set their ``HomeDirectoryType`` to ``LOGICAL``, and specify ``HomeDirectoryMappings`` with ``Entry`` as root ( ``/``) and ``Target`` as their home directory.

   

  For example, if the user's home directory is ``/test/admin-user``, the following command updates the user so that their configuration in the console shows the *Restricted* flag as selected.

   

  ``aws transfer update-user --server-id <server-id> --user-name admin-user --home-directory-type LOGICAL --home-directory-mappings "[{\"Entry\":\"/\", \"Target\":\"/test/admin-user\"}]"``

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.update_user(
        HomeDirectory='string',
        HomeDirectoryType='PATH'|'LOGICAL',
        HomeDirectoryMappings=[
            {
                'Entry': 'string',
                'Target': 'string',
                'Type': 'FILE'|'DIRECTORY'
            },
        ],
        Policy='string',
        PosixProfile={
            'Uid': 123,
            'Gid': 123,
            'SecondaryGids': [
                123,
            ]
        },
        Role='string',
        ServerId='string',
        UserName='string'
    )
    
  :type HomeDirectory: string
  :param HomeDirectory: 

    The landing directory (folder) for a user when they log in to the server using the client.

     

    A ``HomeDirectory`` example is ``/bucket_name/home/mydirectory``.

     

    .. note::

      

      You can use the ``HomeDirectory`` parameter for ``HomeDirectoryType`` when it is set to either ``PATH`` or ``LOGICAL``.

      

    

  
  :type HomeDirectoryType: string
  :param HomeDirectoryType: 

    The type of landing directory (folder) that you want your users' home directory to be when they log in to the server. If you set it to ``PATH``, the user will see the absolute Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon EFS path as is in their file transfer protocol clients. If you set it to ``LOGICAL``, you need to provide mappings in the ``HomeDirectoryMappings`` for how you want to make Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS paths visible to your users.

     

    .. note::

      

      If ``HomeDirectoryType`` is ``LOGICAL``, you must provide mappings, using the ``HomeDirectoryMappings`` parameter. If, on the other hand, ``HomeDirectoryType`` is ``PATH``, you provide an absolute path using the ``HomeDirectory`` parameter. You cannot have both ``HomeDirectory`` and ``HomeDirectoryMappings`` in your template.

      

    

  
  :type HomeDirectoryMappings: list
  :param HomeDirectoryMappings: 

    Logical directory mappings that specify what Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS paths and keys should be visible to your user and how you want to make them visible. You must specify the ``Entry`` and ``Target`` pair, where ``Entry`` shows how the path is made visible and ``Target`` is the actual Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS path. If you only specify a target, it is displayed as is. You also must ensure that your Identity and Access Management (IAM) role provides access to paths in ``Target``. This value can be set only when ``HomeDirectoryType`` is set to *LOGICAL*.

     

    The following is an ``Entry`` and ``Target`` pair example.

     

    ``[ { "Entry": "/directory1", "Target": "/bucket_name/home/mydirectory" } ]``

     

    In most cases, you can use this value instead of the session policy to lock down your user to the designated home directory (" ``chroot``"). To do this, you can set ``Entry`` to '/' and set ``Target`` to the HomeDirectory parameter value.

     

    The following is an ``Entry`` and ``Target`` pair example for ``chroot``.

     

    ``[ { "Entry": "/", "Target": "/bucket_name/home/mydirectory" } ]``

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      Represents an object that contains entries and targets for ``HomeDirectoryMappings``.

       

      The following is an ``Entry`` and ``Target`` pair example for ``chroot``.

       

      ``[ { "Entry": "/", "Target": "/bucket_name/home/mydirectory" } ]``

      

    
      - **Entry** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        Represents an entry for ``HomeDirectoryMappings``.

        

      
      - **Target** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        Represents the map target that is used in a ``HomeDirectoryMapEntry``.

        

      
      - **Type** *(string) --* 

        Specifies the type of mapping. Set the type to ``FILE`` if you want the mapping to point to a file, or ``DIRECTORY`` for the directory to point to a directory.

         

        .. note::

          

          By default, home directory mappings have a ``Type`` of ``DIRECTORY`` when you create a Transfer Family server. You would need to explicitly set ``Type`` to ``FILE`` if you want a mapping to have a file target.

          

        

      
    

  :type Policy: string
  :param Policy: 

    A session policy for your user so that you can use the same Identity and Access Management (IAM) role across multiple users. This policy scopes down a user's access to portions of their Amazon S3 bucket. Variables that you can use inside this policy include ``${Transfer:UserName}``, ``${Transfer:HomeDirectory}``, and ``${Transfer:HomeBucket}``.

     

    .. note::

      

      This policy applies only when the domain of ``ServerId`` is Amazon S3. Amazon EFS does not use session policies.

       

      For session policies, Transfer Family stores the policy as a JSON blob, instead of the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the policy. You save the policy as a JSON blob and pass it in the ``Policy`` argument.

       

      For an example of a session policy, see `Creating a session policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/session-policy>`__.

       

      For more information, see `AssumeRole <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services Security Token Service API Reference*.

      

    

  
  :type PosixProfile: dict
  :param PosixProfile: 

    Specifies the full POSIX identity, including user ID ( ``Uid``), group ID ( ``Gid``), and any secondary groups IDs ( ``SecondaryGids``), that controls your users' access to your Amazon Elastic File Systems (Amazon EFS). The POSIX permissions that are set on files and directories in your file system determines the level of access your users get when transferring files into and out of your Amazon EFS file systems.

    

  
    - **Uid** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The POSIX user ID used for all EFS operations by this user.

      

    
    - **Gid** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The POSIX group ID used for all EFS operations by this user.

      

    
    - **SecondaryGids** *(list) --* 

      The secondary POSIX group IDs used for all EFS operations by this user.

      

    
      - *(integer) --* 

      
  
  
  :type Role: string
  :param Role: 

    The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that controls your users' access to your Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon EFS file system. The policies attached to this role determine the level of access that you want to provide your users when transferring files into and out of your Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon EFS file system. The IAM role should also contain a trust relationship that allows the server to access your resources when servicing your users' transfer requests.

    

  
  :type ServerId: string
  :param ServerId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A system-assigned unique identifier for a Transfer Family server instance that the user is assigned to.

    

  
  :type UserName: string
  :param UserName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A unique string that identifies a user and is associated with a server as specified by the ``ServerId``. This user name must be a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 100 characters long. The following are valid characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, underscore '_', hyphen '-', period '.', and at sign '@'. The user name can't start with a hyphen, period, or at sign.

    **Response Structure**

      - **UserName** *(string) --* 

        The unique identifier for a user that is assigned to a server instance that was specified in the request.
