  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_users(
        MaxResults=123,
        NextToken='string',
        ServerId='string'
    )
    
  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    Specifies the number of users to return as a response to the ``ListUsers`` request.

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    If there are additional results from the ``ListUsers`` call, a ``NextToken`` parameter is returned in the output. You can then pass the ``NextToken`` to a subsequent ``ListUsers`` command, to continue listing additional users.

    

  
  :type ServerId: string
  :param ServerId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A system-assigned unique identifier for a server that has users assigned to it.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

        When you can get additional results from the ``ListUsers`` call, a ``NextToken`` parameter is returned in the output. You can then pass in a subsequent command to the ``NextToken`` parameter to continue listing additional users.

        
      

      - **ServerId** *(string) --* 

        A system-assigned unique identifier for a server that the users are assigned to.

        
      

      - **Users** *(list) --* 

        Returns the Transfer Family users and their properties for the ``ServerId`` value that you specify.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          Returns properties of the user that you specify.

          
          

          - **Arn** *(string) --* 

            Provides the unique Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the user that you want to learn about.

            
          

          - **HomeDirectory** *(string) --* 

            The landing directory (folder) for a user when they log in to the server using the client.

             

            A ``HomeDirectory`` example is ``/bucket_name/home/mydirectory``.

             

            .. note::

              

              You can use the ``HomeDirectory`` parameter for ``HomeDirectoryType`` when it is set to either ``PATH`` or ``LOGICAL``.

              

            
          

          - **HomeDirectoryType** *(string) --* 

            The type of landing directory (folder) that you want your users' home directory to be when they log in to the server. If you set it to ``PATH``, the user will see the absolute Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon EFS path as is in their file transfer protocol clients. If you set it to ``LOGICAL``, you need to provide mappings in the ``HomeDirectoryMappings`` for how you want to make Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS paths visible to your users.

             

            .. note::

              

              If ``HomeDirectoryType`` is ``LOGICAL``, you must provide mappings, using the ``HomeDirectoryMappings`` parameter. If, on the other hand, ``HomeDirectoryType`` is ``PATH``, you provide an absolute path using the ``HomeDirectory`` parameter. You cannot have both ``HomeDirectory`` and ``HomeDirectoryMappings`` in your template.

              

            
          

          - **Role** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that controls your users' access to your Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon EFS file system. The policies attached to this role determine the level of access that you want to provide your users when transferring files into and out of your Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon EFS file system. The IAM role should also contain a trust relationship that allows the server to access your resources when servicing your users' transfer requests.

             

            .. note::

              

              The IAM role that controls your users' access to your Amazon S3 bucket for servers with ``Domain=S3``, or your EFS file system for servers with ``Domain=EFS``.

               

              The policies attached to this role determine the level of access you want to provide your users when transferring files into and out of your S3 buckets or EFS file systems.

              

            
          

          - **SshPublicKeyCount** *(integer) --* 

            Specifies the number of SSH public keys stored for the user you specified.

            
          

          - **UserName** *(string) --* 

            Specifies the name of the user whose ARN was specified. User names are used for authentication purposes.
