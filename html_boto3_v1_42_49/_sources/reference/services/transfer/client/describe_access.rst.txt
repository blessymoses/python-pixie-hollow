.. py:method:: Transfer.Client.describe_access(**kwargs)

  

  Describes the access that is assigned to the specific file transfer protocol-enabled server, as identified by its ``ServerId`` property and its ``ExternalId``.

   

  The response from this call returns the properties of the access that is associated with the ``ServerId`` value that was specified.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.describe_access(
        ServerId='string',
        ExternalId='string'
    )
    
  :type ServerId: string
  :param ServerId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A system-assigned unique identifier for a server that has this access assigned.

    

  
  :type ExternalId: string
  :param ExternalId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A unique identifier that is required to identify specific groups within your directory. The users of the group that you associate have access to your Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS resources over the enabled protocols using Transfer Family. If you know the group name, you can view the SID values by running the following command using Windows PowerShell.

     

    ``Get-ADGroup -Filter {samAccountName -like "YourGroupName*"} -Properties * | Select SamAccountName,ObjectSid``

     

    In that command, replace *YourGroupName* with the name of your Active Directory group.

     

    The regular expression used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of uppercase and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include underscores or any of the following characters: =,.@:/-

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **ServerId** *(string) --* 

        A system-assigned unique identifier for a server that has this access assigned.

        
      

      - **Access** *(dict) --* 

        The external identifier of the server that the access is attached to.

        
        

        - **HomeDirectory** *(string) --* 

          The landing directory (folder) for a user when they log in to the server using the client.

           

          A ``HomeDirectory`` example is ``/bucket_name/home/mydirectory``.

           

          .. note::

            

            You can use the ``HomeDirectory`` parameter for ``HomeDirectoryType`` when it is set to either ``PATH`` or ``LOGICAL``.

            

          
        

        - **HomeDirectoryMappings** *(list) --* 

          Logical directory mappings that specify what Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS paths and keys should be visible to your user and how you want to make them visible. You must specify the ``Entry`` and ``Target`` pair, where ``Entry`` shows how the path is made visible and ``Target`` is the actual Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS path. If you only specify a target, it is displayed as is. You also must ensure that your Identity and Access Management (IAM) role provides access to paths in ``Target``. This value can be set only when ``HomeDirectoryType`` is set to *LOGICAL*.

           

          In most cases, you can use this value instead of the session policy to lock down the associated access to the designated home directory (" ``chroot``"). To do this, you can set ``Entry`` to '/' and set ``Target`` to the ``HomeDirectory`` parameter value.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            Represents an object that contains entries and targets for ``HomeDirectoryMappings``.

             

            The following is an ``Entry`` and ``Target`` pair example for ``chroot``.

             

            ``[ { "Entry": "/", "Target": "/bucket_name/home/mydirectory" } ]``

            
            

            - **Entry** *(string) --* 

              Represents an entry for ``HomeDirectoryMappings``.

              
            

            - **Target** *(string) --* 

              Represents the map target that is used in a ``HomeDirectoryMapEntry``.

              
            

            - **Type** *(string) --* 

              Specifies the type of mapping. Set the type to ``FILE`` if you want the mapping to point to a file, or ``DIRECTORY`` for the directory to point to a directory.

               

              .. note::

                

                By default, home directory mappings have a ``Type`` of ``DIRECTORY`` when you create a Transfer Family server. You would need to explicitly set ``Type`` to ``FILE`` if you want a mapping to have a file target.

                

              
        
      
        

        - **HomeDirectoryType** *(string) --* 

          The type of landing directory (folder) that you want your users' home directory to be when they log in to the server. If you set it to ``PATH``, the user will see the absolute Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon EFS path as is in their file transfer protocol clients. If you set it to ``LOGICAL``, you need to provide mappings in the ``HomeDirectoryMappings`` for how you want to make Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS paths visible to your users.

           

          .. note::

            

            If ``HomeDirectoryType`` is ``LOGICAL``, you must provide mappings, using the ``HomeDirectoryMappings`` parameter. If, on the other hand, ``HomeDirectoryType`` is ``PATH``, you provide an absolute path using the ``HomeDirectory`` parameter. You cannot have both ``HomeDirectory`` and ``HomeDirectoryMappings`` in your template.

            

          
        

        - **Policy** *(string) --* 

          A session policy for your user so that you can use the same Identity and Access Management (IAM) role across multiple users. This policy scopes down a user's access to portions of their Amazon S3 bucket. Variables that you can use inside this policy include ``${Transfer:UserName}``, ``${Transfer:HomeDirectory}``, and ``${Transfer:HomeBucket}``.

          
        

        - **PosixProfile** *(dict) --* 

          The full POSIX identity, including user ID ( ``Uid``), group ID ( ``Gid``), and any secondary groups IDs ( ``SecondaryGids``), that controls your users' access to your Amazon EFS file systems. The POSIX permissions that are set on files and directories in your file system determine the level of access your users get when transferring files into and out of your Amazon EFS file systems.

          
          

          - **Uid** *(integer) --* 

            The POSIX user ID used for all EFS operations by this user.

            
          

          - **Gid** *(integer) --* 

            The POSIX group ID used for all EFS operations by this user.

            
          

          - **SecondaryGids** *(list) --* 

            The secondary POSIX group IDs used for all EFS operations by this user.

            
            

            - *(integer) --* 
        
      
        

        - **Role** *(string) --* 

          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that controls your users' access to your Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon EFS file system. The policies attached to this role determine the level of access that you want to provide your users when transferring files into and out of your Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon EFS file system. The IAM role should also contain a trust relationship that allows the server to access your resources when servicing your users' transfer requests.

          
        

        - **ExternalId** *(string) --* 

          A unique identifier that is required to identify specific groups within your directory. The users of the group that you associate have access to your Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS resources over the enabled protocols using Transfer Family. If you know the group name, you can view the SID values by running the following command using Windows PowerShell.

           

          ``Get-ADGroup -Filter {samAccountName -like "YourGroupName*"} -Properties * | Select SamAccountName,ObjectSid``

           

          In that command, replace *YourGroupName* with the name of your Active Directory group.

           

          The regular expression used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of uppercase and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include underscores or any of the following characters: =,.@:/-
