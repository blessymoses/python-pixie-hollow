.. py:method:: Transfer.Client.describe_execution(**kwargs)

  

  You can use ``DescribeExecution`` to check the details of the execution of the specified workflow.

   

  .. note::

    

    This API call only returns details for in-progress workflows.

     

    If you provide an ID for an execution that is not in progress, or if the execution doesn't match the specified workflow ID, you receive a ``ResourceNotFound`` exception.
