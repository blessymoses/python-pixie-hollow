    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **ServerId** *(string) --* 

        A system-assigned unique identifier for a server that has this user assigned.

        
      

      - **User** *(dict) --* 

        An array containing the properties of the Transfer Family user for the ``ServerID`` value that you specified.

        
        

        - **Arn** *(string) --* 

          Specifies the unique Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the user that was requested to be described.

          
        

        - **HomeDirectory** *(string) --* 

          The landing directory (folder) for a user when they log in to the server using the client.

           

          A ``HomeDirectory`` example is ``/bucket_name/home/mydirectory``.

           

          .. note::

            

            You can use the ``HomeDirectory`` parameter for ``HomeDirectoryType`` when it is set to either ``PATH`` or ``LOGICAL``.

            

          
        

        - **HomeDirectoryMappings** *(list) --* 

          Logical directory mappings that specify what Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS paths and keys should be visible to your user and how you want to make them visible. You must specify the ``Entry`` and ``Target`` pair, where ``Entry`` shows how the path is made visible and ``Target`` is the actual Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS path. If you only specify a target, it is displayed as is. You also must ensure that your Identity and Access Management (IAM) role provides access to paths in ``Target``. This value can be set only when ``HomeDirectoryType`` is set to *LOGICAL*.

           

          In most cases, you can use this value instead of the session policy to lock your user down to the designated home directory (" ``chroot``"). To do this, you can set ``Entry`` to '/' and set ``Target`` to the HomeDirectory parameter value.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            Represents an object that contains entries and targets for ``HomeDirectoryMappings``.

             

            The following is an ``Entry`` and ``Target`` pair example for ``chroot``.

             

            ``[ { "Entry": "/", "Target": "/bucket_name/home/mydirectory" } ]``

            
            

            - **Entry** *(string) --* 

              Represents an entry for ``HomeDirectoryMappings``.

              
            

            - **Target** *(string) --* 

              Represents the map target that is used in a ``HomeDirectoryMapEntry``.

              
            

            - **Type** *(string) --* 

              Specifies the type of mapping. Set the type to ``FILE`` if you want the mapping to point to a file, or ``DIRECTORY`` for the directory to point to a directory.

               

              .. note::

                

                By default, home directory mappings have a ``Type`` of ``DIRECTORY`` when you create a Transfer Family server. You would need to explicitly set ``Type`` to ``FILE`` if you want a mapping to have a file target.

                

              
        
      
        

        - **HomeDirectoryType** *(string) --* 

          The type of landing directory (folder) that you want your users' home directory to be when they log in to the server. If you set it to ``PATH``, the user will see the absolute Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon EFS path as is in their file transfer protocol clients. If you set it to ``LOGICAL``, you need to provide mappings in the ``HomeDirectoryMappings`` for how you want to make Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS paths visible to your users.

           

          .. note::

            

            If ``HomeDirectoryType`` is ``LOGICAL``, you must provide mappings, using the ``HomeDirectoryMappings`` parameter. If, on the other hand, ``HomeDirectoryType`` is ``PATH``, you provide an absolute path using the ``HomeDirectory`` parameter. You cannot have both ``HomeDirectory`` and ``HomeDirectoryMappings`` in your template.

            

          
        

        - **Policy** *(string) --* 

          A session policy for your user so that you can use the same Identity and Access Management (IAM) role across multiple users. This policy scopes down a user's access to portions of their Amazon S3 bucket. Variables that you can use inside this policy include ``${Transfer:UserName}``, ``${Transfer:HomeDirectory}``, and ``${Transfer:HomeBucket}``.

          
        

        - **PosixProfile** *(dict) --* 

          Specifies the full POSIX identity, including user ID ( ``Uid``), group ID ( ``Gid``), and any secondary groups IDs ( ``SecondaryGids``), that controls your users' access to your Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file systems. The POSIX permissions that are set on files and directories in your file system determine the level of access your users get when transferring files into and out of your Amazon EFS file systems.

          
          

          - **Uid** *(integer) --* 

            The POSIX user ID used for all EFS operations by this user.

            
          

          - **Gid** *(integer) --* 

            The POSIX group ID used for all EFS operations by this user.

            
          

          - **SecondaryGids** *(list) --* 

            The secondary POSIX group IDs used for all EFS operations by this user.

            
            

            - *(integer) --* 
        
      
        

        - **Role** *(string) --* 

          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that controls your users' access to your Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon EFS file system. The policies attached to this role determine the level of access that you want to provide your users when transferring files into and out of your Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon EFS file system. The IAM role should also contain a trust relationship that allows the server to access your resources when servicing your users' transfer requests.

          
        

        - **SshPublicKeys** *(list) --* 

          Specifies the public key portion of the Secure Shell (SSH) keys stored for the described user.

           

          .. note::

            

            To delete the public key body, set its value to zero keys, as shown here:

             

            ``SshPublicKeys: []``

            

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            Provides information about the public Secure Shell (SSH) key that is associated with a Transfer Family user for the specific file transfer protocol-enabled server (as identified by ``ServerId``). The information returned includes the date the key was imported, the public key contents, and the public key ID. A user can store more than one SSH public key associated with their user name on a specific server.

            
            

            - **DateImported** *(datetime) --* 

              Specifies the date that the public key was added to the Transfer Family user.

              
            

            - **SshPublicKeyBody** *(string) --* 

              Specifies the content of the SSH public key as specified by the ``PublicKeyId``.

               

              Transfer Family accepts RSA, ECDSA, and ED25519 keys.

              
            

            - **SshPublicKeyId** *(string) --* 

              Specifies the ``SshPublicKeyId`` parameter contains the identifier of the public key.

              
        
      
        

        - **Tags** *(list) --* 

          Specifies the key-value pairs for the user requested. Tag can be used to search for and group users for a variety of purposes.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            Creates a key-value pair for a specific resource. Tags are metadata that you can use to search for and group a resource for various purposes. You can apply tags to servers, users, and roles. A tag key can take more than one value. For example, to group servers for accounting purposes, you might create a tag called ``Group`` and assign the values ``Research`` and ``Accounting`` to that group.

            
            

            - **Key** *(string) --* 

              The name assigned to the tag that you create.

              
            

            - **Value** *(string) --* 

              Contains one or more values that you assigned to the key name you create.

              
        
      
        

        - **UserName** *(string) --* 

          Specifies the name of the user that was requested to be described. User names are used for authentication purposes. This is the string that will be used by your user when they log in to your server.
