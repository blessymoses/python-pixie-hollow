.. py:method:: Transfer.Client.stop_server(**kwargs)

  

  Changes the state of a file transfer protocol-enabled server from ``ONLINE`` to ``OFFLINE``. An ``OFFLINE`` server cannot accept and process file transfer jobs. Information tied to your server, such as server and user properties, are not affected by stopping your server.

   

  .. note::

    

    Stopping the server does not reduce or impact your file transfer protocol endpoint billing; you must delete the server to stop being billed.

    

   

  The state of ``STOPPING`` indicates that the server is in an intermediate state, either not fully able to respond, or not fully offline. The values of ``STOP_FAILED`` can indicate an error condition.

   

  No response is returned from this call.
