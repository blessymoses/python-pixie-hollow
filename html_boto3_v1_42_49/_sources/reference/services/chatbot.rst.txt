.. py:class:: Chatbot.Client

  A low-level client representing AWS Chatbot
  

  The *AWS Chatbot API Reference* provides descriptions, API request parameters, and the XML response for each of the AWS Chatbot API actions.

   

  AWS Chatbot APIs are currently available in the following Regions:

   

  
  * US East (Ohio) - ``us-east-2``
   
  * US West (Oregon) - ``us-west-2``
   
  * Asia Pacific (Singapore) - ``ap-southeast-1``
   
  * Europe (Ireland) - ``eu-west-1``
  

   

  The AWS Chatbot console can only be used in US East (Ohio). Your configuration data however, is stored in each of the relevant available Regions.

   

  .. note::

    

    Your AWS CloudTrail events are logged in whatever Region you call from, not US East (N. Virginia) by default.

    

  ::

    
    import boto3
    
    client = boto3.client('chatbot')
