  Deletes an SageMaker AI notebook instance. Before you can delete a notebook instance, you must call the ``StopNotebookInstance`` API.

    When you delete a notebook instance, you lose all of your data. SageMaker AI removes the ML compute instance, and deletes the ML storage volume and the network interface associated with the notebook instance.
