.. py:method:: SageMaker.Client.add_association(**kwargs)

  

  Creates an *association* between the source and the destination. A source can be associated with multiple destinations, and a destination can be associated with multiple sources. An association is a lineage tracking entity. For more information, see `Amazon SageMaker ML Lineage Tracking <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/lineage-tracking.html>`__.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.add_association(
        SourceArn='string',
        DestinationArn='string',
        AssociationType='ContributedTo'|'AssociatedWith'|'DerivedFrom'|'Produced'|'SameAs'
    )
    
  :type SourceArn: string
  :param SourceArn: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ARN of the source.

    

  
  :type DestinationArn: string
  :param DestinationArn: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the destination.

    

  
  :type AssociationType: string
  :param AssociationType: 

    The type of association. The following are suggested uses for each type. Amazon SageMaker places no restrictions on their use.

     

    
    * ContributedTo - The source contributed to the destination or had a part in enabling the destination. For example, the training data contributed to the training job.
     
    * AssociatedWith - The source is connected to the destination. For example, an approval workflow is associated with a model deployment.
     
    * DerivedFrom - The destination is a modification of the source. For example, a digest output of a channel input for a processing job is derived from the original inputs.
     
    * Produced - The source generated the destination. For example, a training job produced a model artifact.
