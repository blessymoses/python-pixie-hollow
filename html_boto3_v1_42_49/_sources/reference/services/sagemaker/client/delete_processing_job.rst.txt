.. py:method:: SageMaker.Client.delete_processing_job(**kwargs)

  

  Deletes a processing job. After Amazon SageMaker deletes a processing job, all of the metadata for the processing job is lost. You can delete only processing jobs that are in a terminal state ( ``Stopped``, ``Failed``, or ``Completed``). You cannot delete a job that is in the ``InProgress`` or ``Stopping`` state. After deleting the job, you can reuse its name to create another processing job.
