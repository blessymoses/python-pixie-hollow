.. py:method:: SageMaker.Client.delete_feature_group(**kwargs)

  

  Delete the ``FeatureGroup`` and any data that was written to the ``OnlineStore`` of the ``FeatureGroup``. Data cannot be accessed from the ``OnlineStore`` immediately after ``DeleteFeatureGroup`` is called.

   

  Data written into the ``OfflineStore`` will not be deleted. The Amazon Web Services Glue database and tables that are automatically created for your ``OfflineStore`` are not deleted.

   

  Note that it can take approximately 10-15 minutes to delete an ``OnlineStore`` ``FeatureGroup`` with the ``InMemory`` ``StorageType``.
