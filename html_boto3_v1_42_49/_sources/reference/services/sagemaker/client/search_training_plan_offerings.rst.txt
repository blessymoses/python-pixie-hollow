.. py:method:: SageMaker.Client.search_training_plan_offerings(**kwargs)

  

  Searches for available training plan offerings based on specified criteria.

   

  
  * Users search for available plan offerings based on their requirements (e.g., instance type, count, start time, duration).
   
  * And then, they create a plan that best matches their needs using the ID of the plan offering they want to use.
  

   

  For more information about how to reserve GPU capacity for your SageMaker training jobs or SageMaker HyperPod clusters using Amazon SageMaker Training Plan , see ``CreateTrainingPlan ``.

    )
    
  :type InstanceType: string
  :param InstanceType: 

    The type of instance you want to search for in the available training plan offerings. This field allows you to filter the search results based on the specific compute resources you require for your SageMaker training jobs or SageMaker HyperPod clusters. When searching for training plan offerings, specifying the instance type helps you find Reserved Instances that match your computational needs.

    

  
  :type InstanceCount: integer
  :param InstanceCount: 

    The number of instances you want to reserve in the training plan offerings. This allows you to specify the quantity of compute resources needed for your SageMaker training jobs or SageMaker HyperPod clusters, helping you find reserved capacity offerings that match your requirements.

    

  
  :type UltraServerType: string
  :param UltraServerType: 

    The type of UltraServer to search for, such as ml.u-p6e-gb200x72.

    

  
  :type UltraServerCount: integer
  :param UltraServerCount: 

    The number of UltraServers to search for.

    

  
  :type StartTimeAfter: datetime
  :param StartTimeAfter: 

    A filter to search for training plan offerings with a start time after a specified date.

    

  
  :type EndTimeBefore: datetime
  :param EndTimeBefore: 

    A filter to search for reserved capacity offerings with an end time before a specified date.

    

  
  :type DurationHours: integer
  :param DurationHours: 

    The desired duration in hours for the training plan offerings.

    

  
  :type TargetResources: list
  :param TargetResources: 

    The target resources (e.g., SageMaker Training Jobs, SageMaker HyperPod, SageMaker Endpoints) to search for in the offerings.

     

    Training plans are specific to their target resource.

     

    
    * A training plan designed for SageMaker training jobs can only be used to schedule and run training jobs.
     
    * A training plan for HyperPod clusters can be used exclusively to provide compute resources to a cluster's instance group.
     
    * A training plan for SageMaker endpoints can be used exclusively to provide compute resources to SageMaker endpoints for model deployment.
