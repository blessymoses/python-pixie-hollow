.. py:method:: SageMaker.Client.delete_endpoint_config(**kwargs)

  

  Deletes an endpoint configuration. The ``DeleteEndpointConfig`` API deletes only the specified configuration. It does not delete endpoints created using the configuration.

   

  You must not delete an ``EndpointConfig`` in use by an endpoint that is live or while the ``UpdateEndpoint`` or ``CreateEndpoint`` operations are being performed on the endpoint. If you delete the ``EndpointConfig`` of an endpoint that is active or being created or updated you may lose visibility into the instance type the endpoint is using. The endpoint must be deleted in order to stop incurring charges.
