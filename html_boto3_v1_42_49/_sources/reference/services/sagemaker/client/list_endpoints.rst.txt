  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_endpoints(
        SortBy='Name'|'CreationTime'|'Status',
        SortOrder='Ascending'|'Descending',
        NextToken='string',
        MaxResults=123,
        NameContains='string',
        CreationTimeBefore=datetime(2015, 1, 1),
        CreationTimeAfter=datetime(2015, 1, 1),
        LastModifiedTimeBefore=datetime(2015, 1, 1),
        LastModifiedTimeAfter=datetime(2015, 1, 1),
        StatusEquals='OutOfService'|'Creating'|'Updating'|'SystemUpdating'|'RollingBack'|'InService'|'Deleting'|'Failed'|'UpdateRollbackFailed'
    )
    
  :type SortBy: string
  :param SortBy: 

    Sorts the list of results. The default is ``CreationTime``.

    

  
  :type SortOrder: string
  :param SortOrder: 

    The sort order for results. The default is ``Descending``.

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    If the result of a ``ListEndpoints`` request was truncated, the response includes a ``NextToken``. To retrieve the next set of endpoints, use the token in the next request.

    

  
  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    The maximum number of endpoints to return in the response. This value defaults to 10.

    

  
  :type NameContains: string
  :param NameContains: 

    A string in endpoint names. This filter returns only endpoints whose name contains the specified string.

    

  
  :type CreationTimeBefore: datetime
  :param CreationTimeBefore: 

    A filter that returns only endpoints that were created before the specified time (timestamp).

    

  
  :type CreationTimeAfter: datetime
  :param CreationTimeAfter: 

    A filter that returns only endpoints with a creation time greater than or equal to the specified time (timestamp).

    

  
  :type LastModifiedTimeBefore: datetime
  :param LastModifiedTimeBefore: 

    A filter that returns only endpoints that were modified before the specified timestamp.

    

  
  :type LastModifiedTimeAfter: datetime
  :param LastModifiedTimeAfter: 

    A filter that returns only endpoints that were modified after the specified timestamp.

    

  
  :type StatusEquals: string
  :param StatusEquals: 

    A filter that returns only endpoints with the specified status.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **Endpoints** *(list) --* 

        An array or endpoint objects.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          Provides summary information for an endpoint.

          
          

          - **EndpointName** *(string) --* 

            The name of the endpoint.

            
          

          - **EndpointArn** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the endpoint.

            
          

          - **CreationTime** *(datetime) --* 

            A timestamp that shows when the endpoint was created.

            
          

          - **LastModifiedTime** *(datetime) --* 

            A timestamp that shows when the endpoint was last modified.

            
          

          - **EndpointStatus** *(string) --* 

            The status of the endpoint.

             

            
            * ``OutOfService``: Endpoint is not available to take incoming requests.
             
            * ``Creating``: `CreateEndpoint <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateEndpoint.html>`__ is executing.
             
            * ``Updating``: `UpdateEndpoint <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateEndpoint.html>`__ or `UpdateEndpointWeightsAndCapacities <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateEndpointWeightsAndCapacities.html>`__ is executing.
             
            * ``SystemUpdating``: Endpoint is undergoing maintenance and cannot be updated or deleted or re-scaled until it has completed. This maintenance operation does not change any customer-specified values such as VPC config, KMS encryption, model, instance type, or instance count.
             
            * ``RollingBack``: Endpoint fails to scale up or down or change its variant weight and is in the process of rolling back to its previous configuration. Once the rollback completes, endpoint returns to an ``InService`` status. This transitional status only applies to an endpoint that has autoscaling enabled and is undergoing variant weight or capacity changes as part of an `UpdateEndpointWeightsAndCapacities <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateEndpointWeightsAndCapacities.html>`__ call or when the `UpdateEndpointWeightsAndCapacities <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateEndpointWeightsAndCapacities.html>`__ operation is called explicitly.
             
            * ``InService``: Endpoint is available to process incoming requests.
             
            * ``Deleting``: `DeleteEndpoint <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteEndpoint.html>`__ is executing.
             
            * ``Failed``: Endpoint could not be created, updated, or re-scaled. Use ``DescribeEndpointOutput$FailureReason`` for information about the failure. `DeleteEndpoint <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteEndpoint.html>`__ is the only operation that can be performed on a failed endpoint.
            

             

            To get a list of endpoints with a specified status, use the ``StatusEquals`` filter with a call to `ListEndpoints <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_ListEndpoints.html>`__.

            
      
    
      

      - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

        If the response is truncated, SageMaker returns this token. To retrieve the next set of training jobs, use it in the subsequent request.
