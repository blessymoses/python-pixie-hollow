    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **Workteam** *(dict) --* 

        A ``Workteam`` instance that contains information about the work team.

          A list of ``MemberDefinition`` objects that contains objects that identify the workers that make up the work team.

           

          Workforces can be created using Amazon Cognito or your own OIDC Identity Provider (IdP). For private workforces created using Amazon Cognito use ``CognitoMemberDefinition``. For workforces created using your own OIDC identity provider (IdP) use ``OidcMemberDefinition``.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            Defines an Amazon Cognito or your own OIDC IdP user group that is part of a work team.

            
            

            - **CognitoMemberDefinition** *(dict) --* 

              The Amazon Cognito user group that is part of the work team.

              
              

              - **UserPool** *(string) --* 

                An identifier for a user pool. The user pool must be in the same region as the service that you are calling.

                
              

              - **UserGroup** *(string) --* 

                An identifier for a user group.

                
              

              - **ClientId** *(string) --* 

                An identifier for an application client. You must create the app client ID using Amazon Cognito.

                
          
            

            - **OidcMemberDefinition** *(dict) --* 

              A list user groups that exist in your OIDC Identity Provider (IdP). One to ten groups can be used to create a single private work team. When you add a user group to the list of ``Groups``, you can add that user group to one or more private work teams. If you add a user group to a private work team, all workers in that user group are added to the work team.

              
              

              - **Groups** *(list) --* 

                A list of comma seperated strings that identifies user groups in your OIDC IdP. Each user group is made up of a group of private workers.

                
                

                - *(string) --* 
            
          
        
      
        

        - **WorkteamArn** *(string) --* 

          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that identifies the work team.

          
        

        - **WorkforceArn** *(string) --* 

          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the workforce.

          
        

        - **ProductListingIds** *(list) --*

        - **SubDomain** *(string) --* 

          The URI of the labeling job's user interface. Workers open this URI to start labeling your data objects.

          
        

        - **CreateDate** *(datetime) --* 

          The date and time that the work team was created (timestamp).

            The ARN for the Amazon SNS topic to which notifications should be published.

            
      
        

        - **WorkerAccessConfiguration** *(dict) --* 

          Describes any access constraints that have been defined for Amazon S3 resources.

          
          

          - **S3Presign** *(dict) --* 

            Defines any Amazon S3 resource constraints.

            
            

            - **IamPolicyConstraints** *(dict) --* 

              Use this parameter to specify the allowed request source. Possible sources are either ``SourceIp`` or ``VpcSourceIp``.

              
              

              - **SourceIp** *(string) --* 

                When ``SourceIp`` is ``Enabled`` the worker's IP address when a task is rendered in the worker portal is added to the IAM policy as a ``Condition`` used to generate the Amazon S3 presigned URL. This IP address is checked by Amazon S3 and must match in order for the Amazon S3 resource to be rendered in the worker portal.

                
              

              - **VpcSourceIp** *(string) --* 

                When ``VpcSourceIp`` is ``Enabled`` the worker's IP address when a task is rendered in private worker portal inside the VPC is added to the IAM policy as a ``Condition`` used to generate the Amazon S3 presigned URL. To render the task successfully Amazon S3 checks that the presigned URL is being accessed over an Amazon S3 VPC Endpoint, and that the worker's IP address matches the IP address in the IAM policy. To learn more about configuring private worker portal, see `Use Amazon VPC mode from a private worker portal <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/samurai-vpc-worker-portal.html>`__.
