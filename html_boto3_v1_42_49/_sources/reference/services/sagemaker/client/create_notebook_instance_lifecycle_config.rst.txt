.. py:method:: SageMaker.Client.create_notebook_instance_lifecycle_config(**kwargs)

  

  Creates a lifecycle configuration that you can associate with a notebook instance. A *lifecycle configuration* is a collection of shell scripts that run when you create or start a notebook instance.

   

  Each lifecycle configuration script has a limit of 16384 characters.

   

  The value of the ``$PATH`` environment variable that is available to both scripts is ``/sbin:bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin``.

   

  View Amazon CloudWatch Logs for notebook instance lifecycle configurations in log group ``/aws/sagemaker/NotebookInstances`` in log stream ``[notebook-instance-name]/[LifecycleConfigHook]``.

   

  Lifecycle configuration scripts cannot run for longer than 5 minutes. If a script runs for longer than 5 minutes, it fails and the notebook instance is not created or started.

   

  For information about notebook instance lifestyle configurations, see `Step 2.1\: (Optional) Customize a Notebook Instance <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/notebook-lifecycle-config.html>`__.

   

  .. note::

    

    Lifecycle configuration scripts execute with root access and the notebook instance's IAM execution role privileges. Grant this permission only to trusted principals. See `Customize a Notebook Instance Using a Lifecycle Configuration Script <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/notebook-lifecycle-config.html>`__ for security best practices.
