.. py:method:: IoTSiteWise.Client.delete_time_series(**kwargs)

  

  Deletes a time series (data stream). If you delete a time series that's associated with an asset property, the asset property still exists, but the time series will no longer be associated with this asset property.

   

  To identify a time series, do one of the following:

   

  
  * If the time series isn't associated with an asset property, specify the ``alias`` of the time series.
   
  * If the time series is associated with an asset property, specify one of the following: 

    
    * The ``alias`` of the time series.
     
    * The ``assetId`` and ``propertyId`` that identifies the asset property.
