.. py:method:: GuardDuty.Client.create_members(**kwargs)

  

  Creates member accounts of the current Amazon Web Services account by specifying a list of Amazon Web Services account IDs. This step is a prerequisite for managing the associated member accounts either by invitation or through an organization.

   

  As a delegated administrator, using ``CreateMembers`` will enable GuardDuty in the added member accounts, with the exception of the organization delegated administrator account. A delegated administrator must enable GuardDuty prior to being added as a member.

   

  When you use CreateMembers as an Organizations delegated administrator, GuardDuty applies your organization's auto-enable settings to the member accounts in this request, irrespective of the accounts being new or existing members. For more information about the existing auto-enable settings for your organization, see `DescribeOrganizationConfiguration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeOrganizationConfiguration.html>`__.

   

  If you disassociate a member account that was added by invitation, the member account details obtained from this API, including the associated email addresses, will be retained. This is done so that the delegated administrator can invoke the `InviteMembers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/APIReference/API_InviteMembers.html>`__ API without the need to invoke the CreateMembers API again. To remove the details associated with a member account, the delegated administrator must invoke the `DeleteMembers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteMembers.html>`__ API.

   

  When the member accounts added through Organizations are later disassociated, you (administrator) can't invite them by calling the InviteMembers API. You can create an association with these member accounts again only by calling the CreateMembers API.
