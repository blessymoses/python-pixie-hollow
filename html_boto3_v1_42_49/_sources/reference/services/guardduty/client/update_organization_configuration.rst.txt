.. py:method:: GuardDuty.Client.update_organization_configuration(**kwargs)

  

  Configures the delegated administrator account with the provided values. You must provide a value for either ``autoEnableOrganizationMembers`` or ``autoEnable``, but not both.

   

  Specifying both EKS Runtime Monitoring ( ``EKS_RUNTIME_MONITORING``) and Runtime Monitoring ( ``RUNTIME_MONITORING``) will cause an error. You can add only one of these two features because Runtime Monitoring already includes the threat detection for Amazon EKS resources. For more information, see `Runtime Monitoring <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/runtime-monitoring.html>`__.

   

  There might be regional differences because some data sources might not be available in all the Amazon Web Services Regions where GuardDuty is presently supported. For more information, see `Regions and endpoints <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty_regions.html>`__.

  :type DetectorId: string
  :param DetectorId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ID of the detector that configures the delegated administrator.

     

    To find the ``detectorId`` in the current Region, see the Settings page in the GuardDuty console, or run the `ListDetectors <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/APIReference/API_ListDetectors.html>`__ API.

    

  
  :type AutoEnable: boolean
  :param AutoEnable: 

    Represents whether to automatically enable member accounts in the organization. This applies to only new member accounts, not the existing member accounts. When a new account joins the organization, the chosen features will be enabled for them by default.

     

    Even though this is still supported, we recommend using ``AutoEnableOrganizationMembers`` to achieve the similar results. You must provide a value for either ``autoEnableOrganizationMembers`` or ``autoEnable``.

        * ``ALL``: Indicates that all accounts in the organization have the feature enabled automatically. This includes ``NEW`` accounts that join the organization and accounts that may have been suspended or removed from the organization in GuardDuty. It may take up to 24 hours to update the configuration for all the member accounts.
         
        * ``NONE``: Indicates that the feature will not be automatically enabled for any account in the organization. The administrator must manage the feature for each account individually.

          - **AutoEnable** *(string) --* 

            The status of the additional configuration that will be configured for the organization. Use one of the following values to configure the feature status for the entire organization:

             

            
            * ``NEW``: Indicates that when a new account joins the organization, they will have the additional configuration enabled automatically.
             
            * ``ALL``: Indicates that all accounts in the organization have the additional configuration enabled automatically. This includes ``NEW`` accounts that join the organization and accounts that may have been suspended or removed from the organization in GuardDuty.

            * ``NONE``: Indicates that the additional configuration will not be automatically enabled for any account in the organization. The administrator must manage the additional configuration for each account individually.

  :param AutoEnableOrganizationMembers:

    Use one of the following configuration values for ``autoEnableOrganizationMembers``:

     

    
    * ``NEW``: Indicates that when a new account joins the organization, they will have GuardDuty enabled automatically.
     
    * ``ALL``: Indicates that all accounts in the organization have GuardDuty enabled automatically. This includes ``NEW`` accounts that join the organization and accounts that may have been suspended or removed from the organization in GuardDuty. It may take up to 24 hours to update the configuration for all the member accounts.
     
    * ``NONE``: Indicates that GuardDuty will not be automatically enabled for any account in the organization. The administrator must manage GuardDuty for each account in the organization individually. When you update the auto-enable setting from ``ALL`` or ``NEW`` to ``NONE``, this action doesn't disable the corresponding option for your existing accounts. This configuration will apply to the new accounts that join the organization. After you update the auto-enable settings, no new account will have the corresponding option as enabled.
