.. py:method:: GuardDuty.Client.disassociate_from_administrator_account(**kwargs)

  

  Disassociates the current GuardDuty member account from its administrator account.

   

  When you disassociate an invited member from a GuardDuty delegated administrator, the member account details obtained from the `CreateMembers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/APIReference/API_CreateMembers.html>`__ API, including the associated email addresses, are retained. This is done so that the delegated administrator can invoke the `InviteMembers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/APIReference/API_InviteMembers.html>`__ API without the need to invoke the CreateMembers API again. To remove the details associated with a member account, the delegated administrator must invoke the `DeleteMembers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteMembers.html>`__ API.

   

  With ``autoEnableOrganizationMembers`` configuration for your organization set to ``ALL``, you'll receive an error if you attempt to disable GuardDuty in a member account.
