    :type Filters: dict
    :param Filters: 

      An optional input to the list API. If multiple filters are specified, the returned list will be a configuration that match all of the provided filters. Supported filter types are ``InvoiceReceivers``, ``Names``, and ``Accounts``.

      

    
      - **Names** *(list) --* 

        An optional input to the list API. You can specify a list of invoice unit names inside filters to return invoice units that match only the specified invoice unit names. If multiple names are provided, the result is an ``OR`` condition (match any) of the specified invoice unit names.

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
    
      - **InvoiceReceivers** *(list) --* 

        You can specify a list of Amazon Web Services account IDs inside filters to return invoice units that match only the specified accounts. If multiple accounts are provided, the result is an ``OR`` condition (match any) of the specified accounts. This filter only matches the specified accounts on the invoice receivers of the invoice units.

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
    
      - **Accounts** *(list) --* 

        You can specify a list of Amazon Web Services account IDs inside filters to return invoice units that match only the specified accounts. If multiple accounts are provided, the result is an ``OR`` condition (match any) of the specified accounts. The specified account IDs are matched with either the receiver or the linked accounts in the rules.

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
    
      - **BillSourceAccounts** *(list) --* 

        A list of Amazon Web Services account account IDs used to filter invoice units. These are payer accounts from other Organizations that have delegated their billing responsibility to the receiver account through the billing transfer feature.

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
    
    
    :type AsOf: datetime
    :param AsOf: 

      The state of an invoice unit at a specified time. You can see legacy invoice units that are currently deleted if the ``AsOf`` time is set to before it was deleted. If an ``AsOf`` is not provided, the default value is the current time.

      

    
    :type PaginationConfig: dict
    :param PaginationConfig: 

      A dictionary that provides parameters to control pagination.

      

    
      - **MaxItems** *(integer) --* 

        The total number of items to return. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified in max-items then a ``NextToken`` will be provided in the output that you can use to resume pagination.

        

      
      - **PageSize** *(integer) --* 

        The size of each page.

        

      
      - **StartingToken** *(string) --* 

        A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previous response.
