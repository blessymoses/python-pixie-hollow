.. py:method:: MediaConnect.Client.list_offerings(**kwargs)

  

  Displays a list of all offerings that are available to this account in the current Amazon Web Services Region. If you have an active reservation (which means you've purchased an offering that has already started and hasn't expired yet), your account isn't eligible for other offerings.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_offerings(
        MaxResults=123,
        NextToken='string'
    )
    
  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    The maximum number of results to return per API request.

     

    For example, you submit a ``ListOfferings`` request with ``MaxResults`` set at 5. Although 20 items match your request, the service returns no more than the first 5 items. (The service also returns a ``NextToken`` value that you can use to fetch the next batch of results.)

     

    The service might return fewer results than the ``MaxResults`` value. If ``MaxResults`` is not included in the request, the service defaults to pagination with a maximum of 10 results per page.

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    The token that identifies the batch of results that you want to see.

     

    For example, you submit a ``ListOfferings`` request with ``MaxResults`` set at 5. The service returns the first batch of results (up to 5) and a ``NextToken`` value. To see the next batch of results, you can submit the ``ListOfferings`` request a second time and specify the ``NextToken`` value.
