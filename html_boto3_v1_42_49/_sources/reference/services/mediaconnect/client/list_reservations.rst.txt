  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_reservations(
        MaxResults=123,
        NextToken='string'
    )
    
  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    The maximum number of results to return per API request.

     

    For example, you submit a ``ListReservations`` request with ``MaxResults`` set at 5. Although 20 items match your request, the service returns no more than the first 5 items. (The service also returns a NextToken value that you can use to fetch the next batch of results.)

     

    The service might return fewer results than the ``MaxResults`` value. If ``MaxResults`` is not included in the request, the service defaults to pagination with a maximum of 10 results per page.

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    The token that identifies the batch of results that you want to see.

     

    For example, you submit a ``ListReservations`` request with ``MaxResults`` set at 5. The service returns the first batch of results (up to 5) and a ``NextToken`` value. To see the next batch of results, you can submit the ``ListOfferings`` request a second time and specify the ``NextToken`` value.
