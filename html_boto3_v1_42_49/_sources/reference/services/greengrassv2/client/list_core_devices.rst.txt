.. py:method:: GreengrassV2.Client.list_core_devices(**kwargs)

  

  Retrieves a paginated list of Greengrass core devices.

   

  .. note::

    

    IoT Greengrass relies on individual devices to send status updates to the Amazon Web Services Cloud. If the IoT Greengrass Core software isn't running on the device, or if device isn't connected to the Amazon Web Services Cloud, then the reported status of that device might not reflect its current status. The status timestamp indicates when the device status was last updated.

     

    Core devices send status updates at the following times:

     

    
    * When the IoT Greengrass Core software starts
     
    * When the core device receives a deployment from the Amazon Web Services Cloud
     
    * For Greengrass nucleus 2.12.2 and earlier, the core device sends status updates when the status of any component on the core device becomes ``ERRORED`` or ``BROKEN``.
     
    * For Greengrass nucleus 2.12.3 and later, the core device sends status updates when the status of any component on the core device becomes ``ERRORED``, ``BROKEN``, ``RUNNING``, or ``FINISHED``.
     
    * At a `regular interval that you can configure <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/greengrass-nucleus-component.html#greengrass-nucleus-component-configuration-fss>`__, which defaults to 24 hours
     
    * For IoT Greengrass Core v2.7.0, the core device sends status updates upon local deployment and cloud deployment

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_core_devices(
        thingGroupArn='string',
        status='HEALTHY'|'UNHEALTHY',
        maxResults=123,
        nextToken='string',
        runtime='string'
    )
    
  :type thingGroupArn: string
  :param thingGroupArn: 

    The `ARN <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html>`__ of the IoT thing group by which to filter. If you specify this parameter, the list includes only core devices that have successfully deployed a deployment that targets the thing group. When you remove a core device from a thing group, the list continues to include that core device.

    

  
  :type status: string
  :param status: 

    The core device status by which to filter. If you specify this parameter, the list includes only core devices that have this status. Choose one of the following options:

     

    
    * ``HEALTHY`` – The IoT Greengrass Core software and all components run on the core device without issue.
     
    * ``UNHEALTHY`` – The IoT Greengrass Core software or a component is in a failed state on the core device.
    

    

  
  :type maxResults: integer
  :param maxResults: 

    The maximum number of results to be returned per paginated request.

    

  
  :type nextToken: string
  :param nextToken: 

    The token to be used for the next set of paginated results.

    

  
  :type runtime: string
  :param runtime: 

    The runtime to be used by the core device. The runtime can be:

     

    
    * ``aws_nucleus_classic``
     
    * ``aws_nucleus_lite``

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **coreDevices** *(list) --* 

        A list that summarizes each core device.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          Contains information about a Greengrass core device, which is an IoT thing that runs the IoT Greengrass Core software.

          
          

          - **coreDeviceThingName** *(string) --* 

            The name of the core device. This is also the name of the IoT thing.

            
          

          - **status** *(string) --*
