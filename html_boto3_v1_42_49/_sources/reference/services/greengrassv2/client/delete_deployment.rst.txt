.. py:method:: GreengrassV2.Client.delete_deployment(**kwargs)

  

  Deletes a deployment. To delete an active deployment, you must first cancel it. For more information, see `CancelDeployment <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/apireference/API_CancelDeployment.html>`__.

   

  Deleting a deployment doesn't affect core devices that run that deployment, because core devices store the deployment's configuration on the device. Additionally, core devices can roll back to a previous deployment that has been deleted.
