          - **coreDeviceExecutionStatus** *(string) --* 

            The status of the deployment job on the Greengrass core device.

             

            
            * ``IN_PROGRESS`` – The deployment job is running.
             
            * ``QUEUED`` – The deployment job is in the job queue and waiting to run.
             
            * ``FAILED`` – The deployment failed. For more information, see the ``statusDetails`` field.
             
            * ``COMPLETED`` – The deployment to an IoT thing was completed successfully.
             
            * ``TIMED_OUT`` – The deployment didn't complete in the allotted time.
             
            * ``CANCELED`` – The deployment was canceled by the user.
             
            * ``REJECTED`` – The deployment was rejected. For more information, see the ``statusDetails`` field.
             
            * ``SUCCEEDED`` – The deployment to an IoT thing group was completed successfully.
            

            
          

          - **reason** *(string) --* 

            The reason code for the update, if the job was updated.

            
          

          - **creationTimestamp** *(datetime) --* 

            The time at which the deployment was created, expressed in ISO 8601 format.

            
          

          - **modifiedTimestamp** *(datetime) --* 

            The time at which the deployment job was last modified, expressed in ISO 8601 format.

            
          

          - **statusDetails** *(dict) --* 

            The status details that explain why a deployment has an error. This response will be null if the deployment is in a success state.

            
            

            - **errorStack** *(list) --* 

              Contains an ordered list of short error codes that range from the most generic error to the most specific one. The error codes describe the reason for failure whenever the ``coreDeviceExecutionStatus`` is in a failed state. The response will be an empty list if there is no error.

              
              

              - *(string) --* 
          
            

            - **errorTypes** *(list) --* 

              Contains tags which describe the error. You can use the error types to classify errors to assist with remediating the failure. The response will be an empty list if there is no error.

              
              

              - *(string) --*
