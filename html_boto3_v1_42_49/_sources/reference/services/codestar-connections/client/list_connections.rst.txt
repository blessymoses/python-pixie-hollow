    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **Connections** *(list) --* 

        A list of connections and the details for each connection, such as status, owner, and provider type.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          A resource that is used to connect third-party source providers with services like CodePipeline.

           

          Note: A connection created through CloudFormation, the CLI, or the SDK is in `PENDING` status by default. You can make its status `AVAILABLE` by updating the connection in the console.

          
          

          - **ConnectionName** *(string) --* 

            The name of the connection. Connection names must be unique in an Amazon Web Services account.

            
          

          - **ConnectionArn** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the connection. The ARN is used as the connection reference when the connection is shared between Amazon Web Services services.

             

            .. note::

              

              The ARN is never reused if the connection is deleted.

              

            
          

          - **ProviderType** *(string) --* 

            The name of the external provider where your third-party code repository is configured.

            
          

          - **OwnerAccountId** *(string) --* 

            The identifier of the external provider where your third-party code repository is configured. For Bitbucket, this is the account ID of the owner of the Bitbucket repository.

            
          

          - **ConnectionStatus** *(string) --* 

            The current status of the connection.

            
          

          - **HostArn** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the host associated with the connection.

            
      
    
      

      - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

        A token that can be used in the next ``ListConnections`` call. To view all items in the list, continue to call this operation with each subsequent token until no more ``nextToken`` values are returned.
