    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **Attendees** *(list) --* 

        The Amazon Chime SDK attendee information.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          An Amazon Chime SDK meeting attendee. Includes a unique ``AttendeeId`` and ``JoinToken``. The ``JoinToken`` allows a client to authenticate and join as the specified attendee. The ``JoinToken`` expires when the meeting ends, or when  DeleteAttendee is called. After that, the attendee is unable to join the meeting.

           

          We recommend securely transferring each ``JoinToken`` from your server application to the client so that no other client has access to the token except for the one authorized to represent the attendee.

          
          

          - **ExternalUserId** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Chime SDK external user ID. An idempotency token. Links the attendee to an identity managed by a builder application.

             

            Pattern: ``[-_&@+=,(){}\[\]\/«».:|'"#a-zA-Z0-9À-ÿ\s]*``

             

            Values that begin with ``aws:`` are reserved. You can't configure a value that uses this prefix. Case insensitive.

            
          

          - **AttendeeId** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Chime SDK attendee ID.

            
          

          - **JoinToken** *(string) --* 

            The join token used by the Amazon Chime SDK attendee.

            
          

          - **Capabilities** *(dict) --* 

            The capabilities assigned to an attendee: audio, video, or content.

             

            .. note::

              

              You use the capabilities with a set of values that control what the capabilities can do, such as ``SendReceive`` data. For more information about those values, see .

              

             

            When using capabilities, be aware of these corner cases:

             

            
            * If you specify ``MeetingFeatures:Video:MaxResolution:None`` when you create a meeting, all API requests that include ``SendReceive``, ``Send``, or ``Receive`` for ``AttendeeCapabilities:Video`` will be rejected with ``ValidationError 400``.
             
            * If you specify ``MeetingFeatures:Content:MaxResolution:None`` when you create a meeting, all API requests that include ``SendReceive``, ``Send``, or ``Receive`` for ``AttendeeCapabilities:Content`` will be rejected with ``ValidationError 400``.
             
            * You can't set ``content`` capabilities to ``SendReceive`` or ``Receive`` unless you also set ``video`` capabilities to ``SendReceive`` or ``Receive``. If you don't set the ``video`` capability to receive, the response will contain an HTTP 400 Bad Request status code. However, you can set your ``video`` capability to receive and you set your ``content`` capability to not receive.
             
            * If meeting features is defined as ``Video:MaxResolution:None`` but ``Content:MaxResolution`` is defined as something other than ``None`` and attendee capabilities are not defined in the API request, then the default attendee video capability is set to ``Receive`` and attendee content capability is set to ``SendReceive``. This is because content ``SendReceive`` requires video to be at least ``Receive``.
             
            * When you change an ``audio`` capability from ``None`` or ``Receive`` to ``Send`` or ``SendReceive`` , and if the attendee left their microphone unmuted, audio will flow from the attendee to the other meeting participants.
             
            * When you change a ``video`` or ``content`` capability from ``None`` or ``Receive`` to ``Send`` or ``SendReceive`` , and if the attendee turned on their video or content streams, remote attendees can receive those streams, but only after media renegotiation between the client and the Amazon Chime back-end server.
            

            
            

            - **Audio** *(string) --*

              The video capability assigned to an attendee.

              
            

            - **Content** *(string) --* 

              The content capability assigned to an attendee.

              
        
      
    
      

      - **NextToken** *(string) --*
