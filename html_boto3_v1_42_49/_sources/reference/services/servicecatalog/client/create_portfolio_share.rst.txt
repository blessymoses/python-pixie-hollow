.. py:method:: ServiceCatalog.Client.create_portfolio_share(**kwargs)

  

  Shares the specified portfolio with the specified account or organization node. Shares to an organization node can only be created by the management account of an organization or by a delegated administrator. You can share portfolios to an organization, an organizational unit, or a specific account.

   

  Note that if a delegated admin is de-registered, they can no longer create portfolio shares.

   

  ``AWSOrganizationsAccess`` must be enabled in order to create a portfolio share to an organization node.

   

  You can't share a shared resource, including portfolios that contain a shared product.

   

  If the portfolio share with the specified account or organization node already exists, this action will have no effect and will not return an error. To update an existing share, you must use the ``UpdatePortfolioShare`` API instead.

   

  .. note::

    

    When you associate a principal with portfolio, a potential privilege escalation path may occur when that portfolio is then shared with other accounts. For a user in a recipient account who is *not* an Service Catalog Admin, but still has the ability to create Principals (Users/Groups/Roles), that user could create a role that matches a principal name association for the portfolio. Although this user may not know which principal names are associated through Service Catalog, they may be able to guess the user. If this potential escalation path is a concern, then Service Catalog recommends using ``PrincipalType`` as ``IAM``. With this configuration, the ``PrincipalARN`` must already exist in the recipient account before it can be associated.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.create_portfolio_share(
        AcceptLanguage='string',
        PortfolioId='string',
        AccountId='string',
        OrganizationNode={
            'Type': 'ORGANIZATION'|'ORGANIZATIONAL_UNIT'|'ACCOUNT',
            'Value': 'string'
        },
        ShareTagOptions=True|False,
        SharePrincipals=True|False
    )
    
  :type AcceptLanguage: string
  :param AcceptLanguage: 

    The language code.

     

    
    * ``jp`` - Japanese
     
    * ``zh`` - Chinese
    

    

  
  :type PortfolioId: string
  :param PortfolioId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The portfolio identifier.

    

  
  :type AccountId: string
  :param AccountId: 

    The Amazon Web Services account ID. For example, ``123456789012``.

    

  
  :type OrganizationNode: dict
  :param OrganizationNode: 

    The organization node to whom you are going to share. When you pass ``OrganizationNode``, it creates ``PortfolioShare`` for all of the Amazon Web Services accounts that are associated to the ``OrganizationNode``. The output returns a ``PortfolioShareToken``, which enables the administrator to monitor the status of the ``PortfolioShare`` creation process.

    

  
    - **Type** *(string) --* 

      The organization node type.

      

    
    - **Value** *(string) --* 

      The identifier of the organization node.

      

    
  
  :type ShareTagOptions: boolean
  :param ShareTagOptions: 

    Enables or disables ``TagOptions`` sharing when creating the portfolio share. If this flag is not provided, TagOptions sharing is disabled.

    

  
  :type SharePrincipals: boolean
  :param SharePrincipals: 

    This parameter is only supported for portfolios with an **OrganizationalNode** Type of ``ORGANIZATION`` or ``ORGANIZATIONAL_UNIT``.

     

    Enables or disables ``Principal`` sharing when creating the portfolio share. If you do **not** provide this flag, principal sharing is disabled.

     

    When you enable Principal Name Sharing for a portfolio share, the share recipient account end users with a principal that matches any of the associated IAM patterns can provision products from the portfolio. Once shared, the share recipient can view associations of ``PrincipalType``: ``IAM_PATTERN`` on their portfolio. You can create the principals in the recipient account before or after creating the share.
