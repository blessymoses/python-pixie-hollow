.. py:method:: NetworkFirewall.Client.describe_rule_group_metadata(**kwargs)

  

  High-level information about a rule group, returned by operations like create and describe. You can use the information provided in the metadata to retrieve and manage a rule group. You can retrieve all objects for a rule group by calling  DescribeRuleGroup.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.describe_rule_group_metadata(
        RuleGroupName='string',
        RuleGroupArn='string',
        Type='STATELESS'|'STATEFUL'
    )
    
  :type RuleGroupName: string
  :param RuleGroupName: 

    The descriptive name of the rule group. You can't change the name of a rule group after you create it.

     

    You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both.

    

  
  :type RuleGroupArn: string
  :param RuleGroupArn: 

    The descriptive name of the rule group. You can't change the name of a rule group after you create it.

     

    You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both.

    

  
  :type Type: string
  :param Type: 

    Indicates whether the rule group is stateless or stateful. If the rule group is stateless, it contains stateless rules. If it is stateful, it contains stateful rules.

     

    .. note::

      

      This setting is required for requests that do not include the ``RuleGroupARN``.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **RuleGroupArn** *(string) --* 

        The descriptive name of the rule group. You can't change the name of a rule group after you create it.

         

        You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both.

        
      

      - **RuleGroupName** *(string) --* 

        The descriptive name of the rule group. You can't change the name of a rule group after you create it.

         

        You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both.

        
      

      - **Description** *(string) --* 

        Returns the metadata objects for the specified rule group.

        
      

      - **Type** *(string) --* 

        Indicates whether the rule group is stateless or stateful. If the rule group is stateless, it contains stateless rules. If it is stateful, it contains stateful rules.

         

        .. note::

          

          This setting is required for requests that do not include the ``RuleGroupARN``.

          

        
      

      - **Capacity** *(integer) --* 

        The maximum operating resources that this rule group can use. Rule group capacity is fixed at creation. When you update a rule group, you are limited to this capacity. When you reference a rule group from a firewall policy, Network Firewall reserves this capacity for the rule group.

         

        You can retrieve the capacity that would be required for a rule group before you create the rule group by calling  CreateRuleGroup with ``DryRun`` set to ``TRUE``.

        
      

      - **StatefulRuleOptions** *(dict) --* 

        Additional options governing how Network Firewall handles the rule group. You can only use these for stateful rule groups.

        
        

        - **RuleOrder** *(string) --* 

          Indicates how to manage the order of the rule evaluation for the rule group. ``DEFAULT_ACTION_ORDER`` is the default behavior. Stateful rules are provided to the rule engine as Suricata compatible strings, and Suricata evaluates them based on certain settings. For more information, see `Evaluation order for stateful rules <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/latest/developerguide/suricata-rule-evaluation-order.html>`__ in the *Network Firewall Developer Guide*.

          
    
      

      - **LastModifiedTime** *(datetime) --* 

        A timestamp indicating when the rule group was last modified.

        
      

      - **VendorName** *(string) --* 

        The name of the Amazon Web Services Marketplace vendor that provides this rule group.

        
      

      - **ProductId** *(string) --* 

        The unique identifier for the product listing associated with this rule group.

        
      

      - **ListingName** *(string) --* 

        The display name of the product listing for this rule group.
