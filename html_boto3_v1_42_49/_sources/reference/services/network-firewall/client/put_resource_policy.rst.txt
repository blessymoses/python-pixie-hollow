.. py:method:: NetworkFirewall.Client.put_resource_policy(**kwargs)

  

  Creates or updates an IAM policy for your rule group, firewall policy, or firewall. Use this to share these resources between accounts. This operation works in conjunction with the Amazon Web Services Resource Access Manager (RAM) service to manage resource sharing for Network Firewall.

   

  For information about using sharing with Network Firewall resources, see `Sharing Network Firewall resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/latest/developerguide/sharing.html>`__ in the *Network Firewall Developer Guide*.

   

  Use this operation to create or update a resource policy for your Network Firewall rule group, firewall policy, or firewall. In the resource policy, you specify the accounts that you want to share the Network Firewall resource with and the operations that you want the accounts to be able to perform.

   

  When you add an account in the resource policy, you then run the following Resource Access Manager (RAM) operations to access and accept the shared resource.

   

  
  * `GetResourceShareInvitations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/APIReference/API_GetResourceShareInvitations.html>`__ - Returns the Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the resource share invitations.
   
  * `AcceptResourceShareInvitation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/APIReference/API_AcceptResourceShareInvitation.html>`__ - Accepts the share invitation for a specified resource share.
  

   

  For additional information about resource sharing using RAM, see `Resource Access Manager User Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/what-is.html>`__.
