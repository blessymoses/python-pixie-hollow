.. py:method:: NetworkFirewall.Client.list_proxy_rule_groups(**kwargs)

  

  Retrieves the metadata for the proxy rule groups that you have defined. Depending on your setting for max results and the number of proxy rule groups, a single call might not return the full list.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_proxy_rule_groups(
        NextToken='string',
        MaxResults=123
    )
    
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    When you request a list of objects with a ``MaxResults`` setting, if the number of objects that are still available for retrieval exceeds the maximum you requested, Network Firewall returns a ``NextToken`` value in the response. To retrieve the next batch of objects, use the token returned from the prior request in your next request.

    

  
  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    The maximum number of objects that you want Network Firewall to return for this request. If more objects are available, in the response, Network Firewall provides a ``NextToken`` value that you can use in a subsequent call to get the next batch of objects.
