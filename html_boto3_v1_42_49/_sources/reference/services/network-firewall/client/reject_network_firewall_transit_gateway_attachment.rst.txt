.. py:method:: NetworkFirewall.Client.reject_network_firewall_transit_gateway_attachment(**kwargs)

  

  Rejects a transit gateway attachment request for Network Firewall. When you reject the attachment request, Network Firewall cancels the creation of routing components between the transit gateway and firewall endpoints.

   

  Only the transit gateway owner can reject the attachment. After rejection, no traffic will flow through the firewall endpoints for this attachment.

   

  Use  DescribeFirewall to monitor the rejection status. To accept the attachment instead of rejecting it, use  AcceptNetworkFirewallTransitGatewayAttachment.

   

  .. note::

    

    Once rejected, you cannot reverse this action. To establish connectivity, you must create a new transit gateway-attached firewall.
