  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_analysis_reports(
        FirewallName='string',
        FirewallArn='string',
        NextToken='string',
        MaxResults=123
    )
    
  :type FirewallName: string
  :param FirewallName: 

    The descriptive name of the firewall. You can't change the name of a firewall after you create it.

     

    You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both.

    

  
  :type FirewallArn: string
  :param FirewallArn: 

    The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall.

     

    You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both.

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    When you request a list of objects with a ``MaxResults`` setting, if the number of objects that are still available for retrieval exceeds the maximum you requested, Network Firewall returns a ``NextToken`` value in the response. To retrieve the next batch of objects, use the token returned from the prior request in your next request.

    

  
  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    The maximum number of objects that you want Network Firewall to return for this request. If more objects are available, in the response, Network Firewall provides a ``NextToken`` value that you can use in a subsequent call to get the next batch of objects.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **AnalysisReports** *(list) --* 

        The ``id`` and ``ReportTime`` associated with a requested analysis report. Does not provide the status of the analysis report.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          A report that captures key activity from the last 30 days of network traffic monitored by your firewall.

           

          You can generate up to one report per traffic type, per 30 day period. For example, when you successfully create an HTTP traffic report, you cannot create another HTTP traffic report until 30 days pass. Alternatively, if you generate a report that combines metrics on both HTTP and HTTPS traffic, you cannot create another report for either traffic type until 30 days pass.

          
          

          - **AnalysisReportId** *(string) --* 

            The unique ID of the query that ran when you requested an analysis report.

            
          

          - **AnalysisType** *(string) --* 

            The type of traffic that will be used to generate a report.

            
          

          - **ReportTime** *(datetime) --* 

            The date and time the analysis report was ran.

            
          

          - **Status** *(string) --* 

            The status of the analysis report you specify. Statuses include ``RUNNING``, ``COMPLETED``, or ``FAILED``.

            
      
    
      

      - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

        When you request a list of objects with a ``MaxResults`` setting, if the number of objects that are still available for retrieval exceeds the maximum you requested, Network Firewall returns a ``NextToken`` value in the response. To retrieve the next batch of objects, use the token returned from the prior request in your next request.
