.. py:method:: NetworkFirewall.Client.list_vpc_endpoint_associations(**kwargs)

  

  Retrieves the metadata for the VPC endpoint associations that you have defined. If you specify a fireawll, this returns only the endpoint associations for that firewall.

   

  Depending on your setting for max results and the number of associations, a single call might not return the full list.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_vpc_endpoint_associations(
        NextToken='string',
        MaxResults=123,
        FirewallArn='string'
    )
    
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    When you request a list of objects with a ``MaxResults`` setting, if the number of objects that are still available for retrieval exceeds the maximum you requested, Network Firewall returns a ``NextToken`` value in the response. To retrieve the next batch of objects, use the token returned from the prior request in your next request.

    

  
  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    The maximum number of objects that you want Network Firewall to return for this request. If more objects are available, in the response, Network Firewall provides a ``NextToken`` value that you can use in a subsequent call to get the next batch of objects.

    

  
  :type FirewallArn: string
  :param FirewallArn: 

    The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall.

     

    If you don't specify this, Network Firewall retrieves all VPC endpoint associations that you have defined.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

        When you request a list of objects with a ``MaxResults`` setting, if the number of objects that are still available for retrieval exceeds the maximum you requested, Network Firewall returns a ``NextToken`` value in the response. To retrieve the next batch of objects, use the token returned from the prior request in your next request.

        
      

      - **VpcEndpointAssociations** *(list) --* 

        The VPC endpoint assocation metadata objects for the firewall that you specified. If you didn't specify a firewall, this is all VPC endpoint associations that you have defined.

         

        Depending on your setting for max results and the number of firewalls you have, a single call might not be the full list.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          High-level information about a VPC endpoint association, returned by ``ListVpcEndpointAssociations``. You can use the information provided in the metadata to retrieve and manage a VPC endpoint association.

          
          

          - **VpcEndpointAssociationArn** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a VPC endpoint association.
