.. py:method:: NetworkFirewall.Client.list_firewalls(**kwargs)

  

  Retrieves the metadata for the firewalls that you have defined. If you provide VPC identifiers in your request, this returns only the firewalls for those VPCs.

   

  Depending on your setting for max results and the number of firewalls, a single call might not return the full list.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_firewalls(
        NextToken='string',
        VpcIds=[
            'string',
        ],
        MaxResults=123
    )
    
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    When you request a list of objects with a ``MaxResults`` setting, if the number of objects that are still available for retrieval exceeds the maximum you requested, Network Firewall returns a ``NextToken`` value in the response. To retrieve the next batch of objects, use the token returned from the prior request in your next request.

    

  
  :type VpcIds: list
  :param VpcIds: 

    The unique identifiers of the VPCs that you want Network Firewall to retrieve the firewalls for. Leave this blank to retrieve all firewalls that you have defined.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    The maximum number of objects that you want Network Firewall to return for this request. If more objects are available, in the response, Network Firewall provides a ``NextToken`` value that you can use in a subsequent call to get the next batch of objects.

      - **Firewalls** *(list) --* 

        The firewall metadata objects for the VPCs that you specified. Depending on your setting for max results and the number of firewalls you have, a single call might not be the full list.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          High-level information about a firewall, returned by operations like create and describe. You can use the information provided in the metadata to retrieve and manage a firewall.

          
          

          - **FirewallName** *(string) --* 

            The descriptive name of the firewall. You can't change the name of a firewall after you create it.
