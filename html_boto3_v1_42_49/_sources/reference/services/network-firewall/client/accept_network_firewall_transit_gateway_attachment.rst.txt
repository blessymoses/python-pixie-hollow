.. py:method:: NetworkFirewall.Client.accept_network_firewall_transit_gateway_attachment(**kwargs)

  

  Accepts a transit gateway attachment request for Network Firewall. When you accept the attachment request, Network Firewall creates the necessary routing components to enable traffic flow between the transit gateway and firewall endpoints.

   

  You must accept a transit gateway attachment to complete the creation of a transit gateway-attached firewall, unless auto-accept is enabled on the transit gateway. After acceptance, use  DescribeFirewall to verify the firewall status.

   

  To reject an attachment instead of accepting it, use  RejectNetworkFirewallTransitGatewayAttachment.

   

  .. note::

    

    It can take several minutes for the attachment acceptance to complete and the firewall to become available.
