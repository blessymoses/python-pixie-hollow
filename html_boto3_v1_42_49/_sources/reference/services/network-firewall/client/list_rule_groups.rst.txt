  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_rule_groups(
        NextToken='string',
        MaxResults=123,
        Scope='MANAGED'|'ACCOUNT',
        ManagedType='AWS_MANAGED_THREAT_SIGNATURES'|'AWS_MANAGED_DOMAIN_LISTS'|'ACTIVE_THREAT_DEFENSE'|'PARTNER_MANAGED',

        Type='STATELESS'|'STATEFUL'
    )
    
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    When you request a list of objects with a ``MaxResults`` setting, if the number of objects that are still available for retrieval exceeds the maximum you requested, Network Firewall returns a ``NextToken`` value in the response. To retrieve the next batch of objects, use the token returned from the prior request in your next request.

    

  
  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    The maximum number of objects that you want Network Firewall to return for this request. If more objects are available, in the response, Network Firewall provides a ``NextToken`` value that you can use in a subsequent call to get the next batch of objects.

    

  
  :type Scope: string
  :param Scope: 

    The scope of the request. The default setting of ``ACCOUNT`` or a setting of ``NULL`` returns all of the rule groups in your account. A setting of ``MANAGED`` returns all available managed rule groups.

    

  
  :type ManagedType: string
  :param ManagedType: 

    Indicates the general category of the Amazon Web Services managed rule group.

    

  
  :type SubscriptionStatus: string
  :param SubscriptionStatus: 

    Filters the results to show only rule groups with the specified subscription status. Use this to find subscribed or unsubscribed rule groups.

    

  
  :type Type: string
  :param Type: 

    Indicates whether the rule group is stateless or stateful. If the rule group is stateless, it contains stateless rules. If it is stateful, it contains stateful rules.
