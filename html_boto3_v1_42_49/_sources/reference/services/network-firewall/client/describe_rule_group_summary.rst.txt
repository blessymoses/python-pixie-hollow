.. py:method:: NetworkFirewall.Client.describe_rule_group_summary(**kwargs)

  

  Returns detailed information for a stateful rule group.

   

  For active threat defense Amazon Web Services managed rule groups, this operation provides insight into the protections enabled by the rule group, based on Suricata rule metadata fields. Summaries are available for rule groups you manage and for active threat defense Amazon Web Services managed rule groups.

   

  To modify how threat information appears in summaries, use the ``SummaryConfiguration`` parameter in  UpdateRuleGroup.
