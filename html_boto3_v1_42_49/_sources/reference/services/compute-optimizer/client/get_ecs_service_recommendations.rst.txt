.. py:method:: ComputeOptimizer.Client.get_ecs_service_recommendations(**kwargs)

  

  Returns Amazon ECS service recommendations.

   

  Compute Optimizer generates recommendations for Amazon ECS services on Fargate that meet a specific set of requirements. For more information, see the `Supported resources and requirements <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/latest/ug/requirements.html>`__ in the *Compute Optimizer User Guide*.

                    'string',

        ]
    )
    
  :type serviceArns: list
  :param serviceArns: 

    The ARN that identifies the Amazon ECS service.

     

    The following is the format of the ARN:

     

    ``arn:aws:ecs:region:aws_account_id:service/cluster-name/service-name``

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type nextToken: string
  :param nextToken: 

    The token to advance to the next page of Amazon ECS service recommendations.

    

  
  :type maxResults: integer
  :param maxResults: 

    The maximum number of Amazon ECS service recommendations to return with a single request.

     

    To retrieve the remaining results, make another request with the returned ``nextToken`` value.

    

  
  :type filters: list
  :param filters: 

    An array of objects to specify a filter that returns a more specific list of Amazon ECS service recommendations.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      Describes a filter that returns a more specific list of Amazon ECS service recommendations. Use this filter with the  GetECSServiceRecommendations action.

      

    
      - **name** *(string) --* 

        The name of the filter.

         

        Specify ``Finding`` to return recommendations with a specific finding classification.

         

        Specify ``FindingReasonCode`` to return recommendations with a specific finding reason code.

         

        You can filter your Amazon ECS service recommendations by ``tag:key`` and ``tag-key`` tags.

         

        A ``tag:key`` is a key and value combination of a tag assigned to your Amazon ECS service recommendations. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value. For example, to find all Amazon ECS service recommendations that have a tag with the key of ``Owner`` and the value of ``TeamA``, specify ``tag:Owner`` for the filter name and ``TeamA`` for the filter value.

         

        A ``tag-key`` is the key of a tag assigned to your Amazon ECS service recommendations. Use this filter to find all of your Amazon ECS service recommendations that have a tag with a specific key. This doesn’t consider the tag value. For example, you can find your Amazon ECS service recommendations with a tag key value of ``Owner`` or without any tag keys assigned.

        

      
      - **values** *(list) --* 

        The value of the filter.

         

        The valid values for this parameter are as follows:

         

        
        * If you specify the ``name`` parameter as ``Finding``, specify ``Optimized``, ``Underprovisioned``, or ``Overprovisioned``.
         
        * If you specify the ``name`` parameter as ``FindingReasonCode``, specify ``CPUUnderprovisioned``, ``CPUOverprovisioned``, ``MemoryUnderprovisioned``, or ``MemoryOverprovisioned``.
        

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
    
    

  :type accountIds: list
  :param accountIds: 

    Return the Amazon ECS service recommendations to the specified Amazon Web Services account IDs.

     

    If your account is the management account or the delegated administrator of an organization, use this parameter to return the Amazon ECS service recommendations to specific member accounts.

     

    You can only specify one account ID per request.

              For more information about step scaling and target scaling, see `Step scaling policies for Application Auto Scaling <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/userguide/application-auto-scaling-step-scaling-policies.html>`__ and `Target tracking scaling policies for Application Auto Scaling <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/userguide/application-auto-scaling-target-tracking.html>`__ in the *Application Auto Scaling User Guide*.

              
            

            - **taskDefinitionArn** *(string) --* 

              The task definition ARN used by the tasks in the Amazon ECS service.

            An array of objects that describe the utilization metrics of the Amazon ECS service.

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

              Describes the utilization metric of an Amazon ECS service.

               

              To determine the performance difference between your current Amazon ECS service and the recommended option, compare the utilization metric data of your service against its projected utilization metric data.

              
              

              - **name** *(string) --* 

                The name of the utilization metric.

                 

                The following utilization metrics are available:

                 

                
                * ``Cpu`` — The amount of CPU capacity that's used in the service.
                 
                * ``Memory`` — The amount of memory that's used in the service.
                

                
              

              - **statistic** *(string) --* 

                The statistic of the utilization metric.

                 

                The Compute Optimizer API, Command Line Interface (CLI), and SDKs return utilization metrics using only the ``Maximum`` statistic, which is the highest value observed during the specified period.

                 

                The Compute Optimizer console displays graphs for some utilization metrics using the ``Average`` statistic, which is the value of ``Sum`` / ``SampleCount`` during the specified period. For more information, see `Viewing resource recommendations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/latest/ug/viewing-recommendations.html>`__ in the *Compute Optimizer User Guide*. You can also get averaged utilization metric data for your resources using Amazon CloudWatch. For more information, see the `Amazon CloudWatch User Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/WhatIsCloudWatch.html>`__.

            The number of days the Amazon ECS service utilization metrics were analyzed.

            
          

          - **launchType** *(string) --* 

            The launch type the Amazon ECS service is using.

             

            .. note::

              

              Compute Optimizer only supports the Fargate launch type.

              

            
          

          - **lastRefreshTimestamp** *(datetime) --*

          - **finding** *(string) --* 

            The finding classification of an Amazon ECS service.

             

            Findings for Amazon ECS services include:

             

            
            * ``Underprovisioned`` — When Compute Optimizer detects that there’s not enough memory or CPU, an Amazon ECS service is considered under-provisioned. An under-provisioned service might result in poor application performance.
             
            * ``Overprovisioned`` — When Compute Optimizer detects that there’s excessive memory or CPU, an Amazon ECS service is considered over-provisioned. An over-provisioned service might result in additional infrastructure costs.
             
            * ``Optimized`` — When both the CPU and memory of your Amazon ECS service meet the performance requirements of your workload, the service is considered optimized.
            

            
          

          - **findingReasonCodes** *(list) --* 

            The reason for the finding classification of an Amazon ECS service.

             

            Finding reason codes for Amazon ECS services include:

             

            
            * ``CPUUnderprovisioned`` — The service CPU configuration can be sized up to enhance the performance of your workload. This is identified by analyzing the ``CPUUtilization`` metric of the current service during the look-back period.

                  Savings opportunity data requires that you opt in to Cost Explorer, as well as activate **Receive Amazon EC2 resource recommendations** in the Cost Explorer preferences page. That creates a connection between Cost Explorer and Compute Optimizer. With this connection, Cost Explorer generates savings estimates considering the price of existing resources, the price of recommended resources, and historical usage data. Estimated monthly savings reflects the projected dollar savings associated with each of the recommendations generated.
