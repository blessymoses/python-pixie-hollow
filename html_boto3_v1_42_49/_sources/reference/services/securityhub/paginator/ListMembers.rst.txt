    **Request Syntax**
    ::

      response_iterator = paginator.paginate(
          OnlyAssociated=True|False,
          PaginationConfig={
              'MaxItems': 123,
              'PageSize': 123,
              'StartingToken': 'string'
          }
      )
      
    :type OnlyAssociated: boolean
    :param OnlyAssociated: 

      Specifies which member accounts to include in the response based on their relationship status with the administrator account. The default value is ``TRUE``.

       

      If ``OnlyAssociated`` is set to ``TRUE``, the response includes member accounts whose relationship status with the administrator account is set to ``ENABLED``.

       

      If ``OnlyAssociated`` is set to ``FALSE``, the response includes all existing member accounts.

      

    
    :type PaginationConfig: dict
    :param PaginationConfig: 

      A dictionary that provides parameters to control pagination.

      

    
      - **MaxItems** *(integer) --* 

        The total number of items to return. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified in max-items then a ``NextToken`` will be provided in the output that you can use to resume pagination.

        

      
      - **PageSize** *(integer) --* 

        The size of each page.

        

      
      - **StartingToken** *(string) --*
