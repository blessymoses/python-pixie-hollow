    ::

      response_iterator = paginator.paginate(
          FindingIdentifier={
              'Id': 'string',
              'ProductArn': 'string'
          },

              'MaxItems': 123,
              'PageSize': 123,
              'StartingToken': 'string'
          }
      )
      
    :type FindingIdentifier: dict
    :param FindingIdentifier: **[REQUIRED]** 

      Identifies which finding to get the finding history for.

      

    
      - **Id** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The identifier of the finding that was specified by the finding provider.

        

      
      - **ProductArn** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The ARN generated by Security Hub that uniquely identifies a product that generates findings. This can be the ARN for a third-party product that is integrated with Security Hub, or the ARN for a custom integration.

        

      
    
    :type StartTime: datetime
    :param StartTime: 

      A timestamp that indicates the start time of the requested finding history.

       

      If you provide values for both ``StartTime`` and ``EndTime``, Security Hub returns finding history for the specified time period. If you provide a value for ``StartTime`` but not for ``EndTime``, Security Hub returns finding history from the ``StartTime`` to the time at which the API is called. If you provide a value for ``EndTime`` but not for ``StartTime``, Security Hub returns finding history from the `CreatedAt <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_AwsSecurityFindingFilters.html#securityhub-Type-AwsSecurityFindingFilters-CreatedAt>`__ timestamp of the finding to the ``EndTime``. If you provide neither ``StartTime`` nor ``EndTime``, Security Hub returns finding history from the ``CreatedAt`` timestamp of the finding to the time at which the API is called. In all of these scenarios, the response is limited to 100 results.

       

      For more information about the validation and formatting of timestamp fields in Security Hub, see `Timestamps <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/Welcome.html#timestamps>`__.

      

    
    :type EndTime: datetime
    :param EndTime: 

      An ISO 8601-formatted timestamp that indicates the end time of the requested finding history.

       

      If you provide values for both ``StartTime`` and ``EndTime``, Security Hub returns finding history for the specified time period. If you provide a value for ``StartTime`` but not for ``EndTime``, Security Hub returns finding history from the ``StartTime`` to the time at which the API is called. If you provide a value for ``EndTime`` but not for ``StartTime``, Security Hub returns finding history from the `CreatedAt <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_AwsSecurityFindingFilters.html#securityhub-Type-AwsSecurityFindingFilters-CreatedAt>`__ timestamp of the finding to the ``EndTime``. If you provide neither ``StartTime`` nor ``EndTime``, Security Hub returns finding history from the ``CreatedAt`` timestamp of the finding to the time at which the API is called. In all of these scenarios, the response is limited to 100 results.

    :type PaginationConfig: dict
    :param PaginationConfig: 

      A dictionary that provides parameters to control pagination.

      

    
      - **MaxItems** *(integer) --* 

        The total number of items to return. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified in max-items then a ``NextToken`` will be provided in the output that you can use to resume pagination.

        

      
      - **PageSize** *(integer) --* 

        The size of each page.

        

      
      - **StartingToken** *(string) --* 

        A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previous response.

      - *(dict) --* 
        

        - **Records** *(list) --* 

          A list of events that altered the specified finding during the specified time period.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            A list of events that changed the specified finding during the specified time period. Each record represents a single finding change event.

            
            

            - **FindingIdentifier** *(dict) --* 

              Identifies which finding to get the finding history for.

              
              

              - **Id** *(string) --* 

                The identifier of the finding that was specified by the finding provider.

                
              

              - **ProductArn** *(string) --* 

                The ARN generated by Security Hub that uniquely identifies a product that generates findings. This can be the ARN for a third-party product that is integrated with Security Hub, or the ARN for a custom integration.

                
          
            

            - **UpdateTime** *(datetime) --* 

              A timestamp that indicates when Security Hub processed the updated finding record.

               

              For more information about the validation and formatting of timestamp fields in Security Hub, see `Timestamps <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/Welcome.html#timestamps>`__.

              - *(dict) --* 

                An array of objects that provides details about a change to a finding, including the Amazon Web Services Security Finding Format (ASFF) field that changed, the value of the field before the change, and the value of the field after the change.

                
                

                - **UpdatedField** *(string) --* 

                  The ASFF field that changed during the finding change event.

                  
                

                - **OldValue** *(string) --* 

                  The value of the ASFF field before the finding change event.

                  
                

                - **NewValue** *(string) --* 

                  The value of the ASFF field after the finding change event. To preserve storage and readability, Security Hub omits this value if `FindingHistoryRecord <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_FindingHistoryRecord.html>`__ exceeds database limits.

                  
            
          
            

            - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

              A token for pagination purposes. Provide this token in the subsequent request to `GetFindingsHistory <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_GetFindingsHistory.html>`__ to get up to an additional 100 results of history for the same finding that you specified in your initial request.
