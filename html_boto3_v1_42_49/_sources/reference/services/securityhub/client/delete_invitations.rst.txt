    We recommend using Organizations instead of Security Hub invitations to manage your member accounts.

  Deletes invitations to become a Security Hub member account.

   

  A Security Hub administrator account can use this operation to delete invitations sent to one or more prospective member accounts.

   

  This operation is only used to delete invitations that are sent to prospective member accounts that aren't part of an Amazon Web Services organization. Organization accounts don't receive invitations.
