    **Response Syntax**

    
    ::

      {
          'HubArn': 'string',
          'SubscribedAt': 'string',

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **HubArn** *(string) --* 

        The ARN of the Hub resource that was retrieved.

        
      

      - **SubscribedAt** *(string) --* 

        The date and time when Security Hub was enabled in the account.

        
      

      - **AutoEnableControls** *(boolean) --* 

        Whether to automatically enable new controls when they are added to standards that are enabled.

         

        If set to ``true``, then new controls for enabled standards are enabled automatically. If set to ``false``, then new controls are not enabled.

         

        When you automatically enable new controls, you can interact with the controls in the console and programmatically immediately after release. However, automatically enabled controls have a temporary default status of ``DISABLED``. It can take up to several days for Security Hub to process the control release and designate the control as ``ENABLED`` in your account. During the processing period, you can manually enable or disable a control, and Security Hub will maintain that designation regardless of whether you have ``AutoEnableControls`` set to ``true``.

        
      

      - **ControlFindingGenerator** *(string) --* 

        Specifies whether the calling account has consolidated control findings turned on. If the value for this field is set to ``SECURITY_CONTROL``, Security Hub generates a single finding for a control check even when the check applies to multiple enabled standards.

         

        If the value for this field is set to ``STANDARD_CONTROL``, Security Hub generates separate findings for a control check when the check applies to multiple enabled standards.

         

        The value for this field in a member account matches the value in the administrator account. For accounts that aren't part of an organization, the default value of this field is ``SECURITY_CONTROL`` if you enabled Security Hub on or after February 23, 2023.
