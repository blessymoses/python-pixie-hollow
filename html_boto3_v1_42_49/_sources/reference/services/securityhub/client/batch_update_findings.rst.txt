.. py:method:: SecurityHub.Client.batch_update_findings(**kwargs)

  

  Used by Security Hub customers to update information about their investigation into one or more findings. Requested by administrator accounts or member accounts. Administrator accounts can update findings for their account and their member accounts. A member account can update findings only for their own account. Administrator and member accounts can use this operation to update the following fields and objects for one or more findings:

   

  
  * ``Confidence``
   
  * ``Criticality``
   
  * ``Note``
   
  * ``RelatedFindings``
   
  * ``Severity``
   
  * ``Types``
   
  * ``UserDefinedFields``
   
  * ``VerificationState``
   
  * ``Workflow``
  

   

  If you use this operation to update a finding, your updates don’t affect the value for the ``UpdatedAt`` field of the finding. Also note that it can take several minutes for Security Hub to process your request and update each finding specified in the request.

   

  You can configure IAM policies to restrict access to fields and field values. For example, you might not want member accounts to be able to suppress findings or change the finding severity. For more information see `Configuring access to BatchUpdateFindings <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/finding-update-batchupdatefindings.html#batchupdatefindings-configure-access>`__ in the *Security Hub User Guide*.

    )
    
  :type FindingIdentifiers: list
  :param FindingIdentifiers: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The list of findings to update. ``BatchUpdateFindings`` can be used to update up to 100 findings at a time.

     

    For each finding, the list provides the finding identifier and the ARN of the finding provider.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      Identifies which finding to get the finding history for.

      

    
      - **Id** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The identifier of the finding that was specified by the finding provider.

        

      
      - **ProductArn** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The ARN generated by Security Hub that uniquely identifies a product that generates findings. This can be the ARN for a third-party product that is integrated with Security Hub, or the ARN for a custom integration.

        

      
    

  :type Note: dict
  :param Note: 

    The updated note.

    

  
    - **Text** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The updated note text.

      

    
    - **UpdatedBy** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The principal that updated the note.

      

    
  
  :type Severity: dict
  :param Severity: 

    Used to update the finding severity.

    

  
    - **Normalized** *(integer) --* 

      The normalized severity for the finding. This attribute is to be deprecated in favor of ``Label``.

       

      If you provide ``Normalized`` and don't provide ``Label``, ``Label`` is set automatically as follows.

       

      
      * 0 - ``INFORMATIONAL``
       
      * 1–39 - ``LOW``
       
      * 40–69 - ``MEDIUM``
       
      * 70–89 - ``HIGH``
       
      * 90–100 - ``CRITICAL``
      

      

    
    - **Product** *(float) --* 

      The native severity as defined by the Amazon Web Services service or integrated partner product that generated the finding.

      

    
    - **Label** *(string) --* 

      The severity value of the finding. The allowed values are the following.

       

      
      * ``INFORMATIONAL`` - No issue was found.
       
      * ``LOW`` - The issue does not require action on its own.
       
      * ``MEDIUM`` - The issue must be addressed but not urgently.
       
      * ``HIGH`` - The issue must be addressed as a priority.
       
      * ``CRITICAL`` - The issue must be remediated immediately to avoid it escalating.
      

      

    
  
  :type VerificationState: string
  :param VerificationState: 

    Indicates the veracity of a finding.

     

    The available values for ``VerificationState`` are as follows.

     

    
    * ``UNKNOWN`` – The default disposition of a security finding
     
    * ``TRUE_POSITIVE`` – The security finding is confirmed
     
    * ``FALSE_POSITIVE`` – The security finding was determined to be a false alarm
     
    * ``BENIGN_POSITIVE`` – A special case of ``TRUE_POSITIVE`` where the finding doesn't pose any threat, is expected, or both
    

    

  
  :type Confidence: integer
  :param Confidence: 

    The updated value for the finding confidence. Confidence is defined as the likelihood that a finding accurately identifies the behavior or issue that it was intended to identify.

     

    Confidence is scored on a 0-100 basis using a ratio scale, where 0 means zero percent confidence and 100 means 100 percent confidence.

    

  
  :type Criticality: integer
  :param Criticality: 

    The updated value for the level of importance assigned to the resources associated with the findings.

     

    A score of 0 means that the underlying resources have no criticality, and a score of 100 is reserved for the most critical resources.

    

  
  :type Types: list
  :param Types: 

    One or more finding types in the format of namespace/category/classifier that classify a finding.

     

    Valid namespace values are as follows.

     

    
    * Software and Configuration Checks
     
    * TTPs
     
    * Effects
     
    * Unusual Behaviors
     
    * Sensitive Data Identifications
    

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type UserDefinedFields: dict
  :param UserDefinedFields: 

    A list of name/value string pairs associated with the finding. These are custom, user-defined fields added to a finding.

      - *(string) --* 

      


  :type Workflow: dict
  :param Workflow: 

    Used to update the workflow status of a finding.

     

    The workflow status indicates the progress of the investigation into the finding.

    

  
    - **Status** *(string) --* 

      The status of the investigation into the finding. The workflow status is specific to an individual finding. It does not affect the generation of new findings. For example, setting the workflow status to ``SUPPRESSED`` or ``RESOLVED`` does not prevent a new finding for the same issue.

       

      The allowed values are the following.

       

      
      * ``NEW`` - The initial state of a finding, before it is reviewed. Security Hub also resets ``WorkFlowStatus`` from ``NOTIFIED`` or ``RESOLVED`` to ``NEW`` in the following cases: 

        
        * The record state changes from ``ARCHIVED`` to ``ACTIVE``.
         
        * The compliance status changes from ``PASSED`` to either ``WARNING``, ``FAILED``, or ``NOT_AVAILABLE``.
        

      
       
      * ``NOTIFIED`` - Indicates that you notified the resource owner about the security issue. Used when the initial reviewer is not the resource owner, and needs intervention from the resource owner.
       
      * ``RESOLVED`` - The finding was reviewed and remediated and is now considered resolved.
       
      * ``SUPPRESSED`` - Indicates that you reviewed the finding and don't believe that any action is needed. The finding is no longer updated.
      

      

    
  
  :type RelatedFindings: list
  :param RelatedFindings: 

    A list of findings that are related to the updated findings.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      Details about a related finding.

      

    
      - **ProductArn** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The ARN of the product that generated a related finding.

        

      
      - **Id** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The product-generated identifier for a related finding.
