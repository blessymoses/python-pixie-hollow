.. py:method:: SecurityHub.Client.list_invitations(**kwargs)

  

  .. note::

    

    We recommend using Organizations instead of Security Hub invitations to manage your member accounts. For information, see `Managing Security Hub administrator and member accounts with Organizations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-accounts-orgs.html>`__ in the *Security Hub User Guide*.

    

   

  Lists all Security Hub membership invitations that were sent to the calling account.

   

  Only accounts that are managed by invitation can use this operation. Accounts that are managed using the integration with Organizations don't receive invitations.
