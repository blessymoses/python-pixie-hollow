.. py:method:: SecurityHub.Client.get_master_account()

  

  This method is deprecated. Instead, use ``GetAdministratorAccount``.

   

  The Security Hub console continues to use ``GetMasterAccount``. It will eventually change to use ``GetAdministratorAccount``. Any IAM policies that specifically control access to this function must continue to use ``GetMasterAccount``. You should also add ``GetAdministratorAccount`` to your policies to ensure that the correct permissions are in place after the console begins to use ``GetAdministratorAccount``.

   

  Provides the details for the Security Hub administrator account for the current member account.

   

  Can be used by both member accounts that are managed using Organizations and accounts that were invited manually.

  

  .. danger::

        This operation is deprecated and may not function as expected. This operation should not be used going forward and is only kept for the purpose of backwards compatiblity.
