    We recommend using Organizations instead of Security Hub invitations to manage your member accounts. For information, see `Managing Security Hub administrator and member accounts with Organizations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-accounts-orgs.html>`__ in the *Security Hub User Guide*.

    

   

  Declines invitations to become a Security Hub member account.

   

  A prospective member account uses this operation to decline an invitation to become a member.

   

  Only member accounts that aren't part of an Amazon Web Services organization should use this operation. Organization accounts don't receive invitations.
