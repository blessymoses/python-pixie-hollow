.. py:method:: SecurityHub.Client.create_finding_aggregator(**kwargs)

  

  .. note::

    

    The *aggregation Region* is now called the *home Region*.

    

   

  Used to enable cross-Region aggregation. This operation can be invoked from the home Region only.

   

  For information about how cross-Region aggregation works, see `Understanding cross-Region aggregation in Security Hub <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/finding-aggregation.html>`__ in the *Security Hub User Guide*.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.create_finding_aggregator(
        RegionLinkingMode='string',
        Regions=[
            'string',
        ]
    )
    
  :type RegionLinkingMode: string
  :param RegionLinkingMode: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Indicates whether to aggregate findings from all of the available Regions in the current partition. Also determines whether to automatically aggregate findings from new Regions as Security Hub supports them and you opt into them.

     

    The selected option also determines how to use the Regions provided in the Regions list.

     

    The options are as follows:

     

    
    * ``ALL_REGIONS`` - Aggregates findings from all of the Regions where Security Hub is enabled. When you choose this option, Security Hub also automatically aggregates findings from new Regions as Security Hub supports them and you opt into them.
     
    * ``ALL_REGIONS_EXCEPT_SPECIFIED`` - Aggregates findings from all of the Regions where Security Hub is enabled, except for the Regions listed in the ``Regions`` parameter. When you choose this option, Security Hub also automatically aggregates findings from new Regions as Security Hub supports them and you opt into them.
     
    * ``SPECIFIED_REGIONS`` - Aggregates findings only from the Regions listed in the ``Regions`` parameter. Security Hub does not automatically aggregate findings from new Regions.
     
    * ``NO_REGIONS`` - Aggregates no data because no Regions are selected as linked Regions.
    

    

  
  :type Regions: list
  :param Regions: 

    If ``RegionLinkingMode`` is ``ALL_REGIONS_EXCEPT_SPECIFIED``, then this is a space-separated list of Regions that don't replicate and send findings to the home Region.

     

    If ``RegionLinkingMode`` is ``SPECIFIED_REGIONS``, then this is a space-separated list of Regions that do replicate and send findings to the home Region.

     

    An ``InvalidInputException`` error results if you populate this field while ``RegionLinkingMode`` is ``NO_REGIONS``.

    **Response Syntax**

    
    ::

      {

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **FindingAggregatorArn** *(string) --* 

        The ARN of the finding aggregator. You use the finding aggregator ARN to retrieve details for, update, and stop cross-Region aggregation.

        
      

      - **FindingAggregationRegion** *(string) --* 

        The home Region. Findings generated in linked Regions are replicated and sent to the home Region.

        
      

      - **RegionLinkingMode** *(string) --* 

        Indicates whether to link all Regions, all Regions except for a list of excluded Regions, or a list of included Regions.

        
      

      - **Regions** *(list) --* 

        The list of excluded Regions or included Regions.
