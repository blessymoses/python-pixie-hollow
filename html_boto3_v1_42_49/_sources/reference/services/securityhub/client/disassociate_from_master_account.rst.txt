.. py:method:: SecurityHub.Client.disassociate_from_master_account()

  

  This method is deprecated. Instead, use ``DisassociateFromAdministratorAccount``.

   

  The Security Hub console continues to use ``DisassociateFromMasterAccount``. It will eventually change to use ``DisassociateFromAdministratorAccount``. Any IAM policies that specifically control access to this function must continue to use ``DisassociateFromMasterAccount``. You should also add ``DisassociateFromAdministratorAccount`` to your policies to ensure that the correct permissions are in place after the console begins to use ``DisassociateFromAdministratorAccount``.

   

  Disassociates the current Security Hub member account from the associated administrator account.

   

  This operation is only used by accounts that are not part of an organization. For organization accounts, only the administrator account can disassociate a member account.

  

  .. danger::

        This operation is deprecated and may not function as expected. This operation should not be used going forward and is only kept for the purpose of backwards compatiblity.
