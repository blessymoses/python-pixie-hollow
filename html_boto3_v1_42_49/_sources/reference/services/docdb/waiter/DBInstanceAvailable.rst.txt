    :type DBInstanceIdentifier: string
    :param DBInstanceIdentifier: 

      The user-provided instance identifier. If this parameter is specified, information from only the specific instance is returned. This parameter isn't case sensitive.

       

      Constraints:

       

      
      * If provided, must match the identifier of an existing ``DBInstance``.
      

      

    
    :type Filters: list
    :param Filters: 

      A filter that specifies one or more instances to describe.

       

      Supported filters:

       

      
      * ``db-cluster-id`` - Accepts cluster identifiers and cluster Amazon Resource Names (ARNs). The results list includes only the information about the instances that are associated with the clusters that are identified by these ARNs.
       
      * ``db-instance-id`` - Accepts instance identifiers and instance ARNs. The results list includes only the information about the instances that are identified by these ARNs.
      

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        A named set of filter values, used to return a more specific list of results. You can use a filter to match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as IDs.

         

        Wildcards are not supported in filters.

        

      
        - **Name** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The name of the filter. Filter names are case sensitive.

          

        
        - **Values** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          One or more filter values. Filter values are case sensitive.

          

        
          - *(string) --* 

          
      
      
  
    :type MaxRecords: integer
    :param MaxRecords: 

      The maximum number of records to include in the response. If more records exist than the specified ``MaxRecords`` value, a pagination token (marker) is included in the response so that the remaining results can be retrieved.

       

      Default: 100

       

      Constraints: Minimum 20, maximum 100.

      

    
    :type Marker: string
    :param Marker: 

      An optional pagination token provided by a previous request. If this parameter is specified, the response includes only records beyond the marker, up to the value specified by ``MaxRecords``.

      

    
    :type WaiterConfig: dict
    :param WaiterConfig: 

      A dictionary that provides parameters to control waiting behavior.

      

    
      - **Delay** *(integer) --* 

        The amount of time in seconds to wait between attempts. Default: 30

        

      
      - **MaxAttempts** *(integer) --* 

        The maximum number of attempts to be made. Default: 60

        

      
    
    
    :returns: None
