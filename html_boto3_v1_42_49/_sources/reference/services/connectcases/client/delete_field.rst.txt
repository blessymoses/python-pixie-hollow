.. py:method:: ConnectCases.Client.delete_field(**kwargs)

  

  Deletes a field from a cases template. You can delete up to 100 fields per domain.

   

  After a field is deleted:

   

  
  * You can still retrieve the field by calling ``BatchGetField``.
   
  * You cannot update a deleted field by calling ``UpdateField``; it throws a ``ValidationException``.
   
  * Deleted fields are not included in the ``ListFields`` response.
   
  * Calling ``CreateCase`` with a deleted field throws a ``ValidationException`` denoting which field identifiers in the request have been deleted.
   
  * Calling ``GetCase`` with a deleted field identifier returns the deleted field's value if one exists.
   
  * Calling ``UpdateCase`` with a deleted field ID throws a ``ValidationException`` if the case does not already contain a value for the deleted field. Otherwise it succeeds, allowing you to update or remove (using ``emptyValue: {}``) the field's value from the case.
   
  * ``GetTemplate`` does not return field IDs for deleted fields.
   
  * ``GetLayout`` does not return field IDs for deleted fields.
   
  * Calling ``SearchCases`` with the deleted field ID as a filter returns any cases that have a value for the deleted field that matches the filter criteria.
   
  * Calling ``SearchCases`` with a ``searchTerm`` value that matches a deleted field's value on a case returns the case in the response.
   
  * Calling ``BatchPutFieldOptions`` with a deleted field ID throw a ``ValidationException``.
   
  * Calling ``GetCaseEventConfiguration`` does not return field IDs for deleted fields.
