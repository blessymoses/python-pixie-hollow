.. py:method:: CostExplorer.Client.get_reservation_coverage(**kwargs)

  

  Retrieves the reservation coverage for your account, which you can use to see how much of your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, Amazon ElastiCache, Amazon Relational Database Service, or Amazon Redshift usage is covered by a reservation. An organization's management account can see the coverage of the associated member accounts. This supports dimensions, cost categories, and nested expressions. For any time period, you can filter data about reservation usage by the following dimensions:

   

  
  * AZ
   
  * CACHE_ENGINE
   
  * DATABASE_ENGINE
   
  * DEPLOYMENT_OPTION
   
  * INSTANCE_TYPE
   
  * LINKED_ACCOUNT
   
  * OPERATING_SYSTEM
   
  * PLATFORM
   
  * REGION
   
  * SERVICE
   
  * TAG
   
  * TENANCY
  

   

  To determine valid values for a dimension, use the ``GetDimensionValues`` operation.

    )
    
  :type TimePeriod: dict
  :param TimePeriod: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The start and end dates of the period that you want to retrieve data about reservation coverage for. You can retrieve data for a maximum of 13 months: the last 12 months and the current month. The start date is inclusive, but the end date is exclusive. For example, if ``start`` is ``2017-01-01`` and ``end`` is ``2017-05-01``, then the cost and usage data is retrieved from ``2017-01-01`` up to and including ``2017-04-30`` but not including ``2017-05-01``.

    

  
    - **Start** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The beginning of the time period. The start date is inclusive. For example, if ``start`` is ``2017-01-01``, Amazon Web Services retrieves cost and usage data starting at ``2017-01-01`` up to the end date. The start date must be equal to or no later than the current date to avoid a validation error.

      

    
    - **End** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The end of the time period. The end date is exclusive. For example, if ``end`` is ``2017-05-01``, Amazon Web Services retrieves cost and usage data from the start date up to, but not including, ``2017-05-01``.

      

    
  
  :type GroupBy: list
  :param GroupBy: 

    You can group the data by the following attributes:

     

    
    * AZ
     
    * CACHE_ENGINE
     
    * DATABASE_ENGINE
     
    * DEPLOYMENT_OPTION
     
    * INSTANCE_TYPE
     
    * INVOICING_ENTITY
     
    * LINKED_ACCOUNT
     
    * OPERATING_SYSTEM
     
    * PLATFORM
     
    * REGION
     
    * TENANCY
    

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      Represents a group when you specify a group by criteria or in the response to a query with a specific grouping.

      

    
      - **Type** *(string) --* 

        The string that represents the type of group.

        

      
      - **Key** *(string) --* 

        The string that represents a key for a specified group.

        

      
    

  :type Granularity: string
  :param Granularity: 

    The granularity of the Amazon Web Services cost data for the reservation. Valid values are ``MONTHLY`` and ``DAILY``.

     

    If ``GroupBy`` is set, ``Granularity`` can't be set. If ``Granularity`` isn't set, the response object doesn't include ``Granularity``, either ``MONTHLY`` or ``DAILY``.

     

    The ``GetReservationCoverage`` operation supports only ``DAILY`` and ``MONTHLY`` granularities.

    

  
  :type Filter: dict
  :param Filter: 

    Filters utilization data by dimensions. You can filter by the following dimensions:

     

    
    * AZ
     
    * CACHE_ENGINE
     
    * DATABASE_ENGINE
     
    * DEPLOYMENT_OPTION
     
    * INSTANCE_TYPE
     
    * LINKED_ACCOUNT
     
    * OPERATING_SYSTEM
     
    * PLATFORM
     
    * REGION
     
    * SERVICE
     
    * TAG
     
    * TENANCY
    

     

    ``GetReservationCoverage`` uses the same `Expression <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_Expression.html>`__ object as the other operations, but only ``AND`` is supported among each dimension. You can nest only one level deep. If there are multiple values for a dimension, they are OR'd together.

     

    If you don't provide a ``SERVICE`` filter, Cost Explorer defaults to EC2.

     

    Cost category is also supported.

    

  
    - **Or** *(list) --* 

      Return results that match either ``Dimension`` object.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        Use ``Expression`` to filter in various Cost Explorer APIs.

         

        Not all ``Expression`` types are supported in each API. Refer to the documentation for each specific API to see what is supported.

         

        There are two patterns:

         

        
        * Simple dimension values. 

          
          * There are three types of simple dimension values: ``CostCategories``, ``Tags``, and ``Dimensions``. 

            
            * Specify the ``CostCategories`` field to define a filter that acts on Cost Categories.
             
            * Specify the ``Tags`` field to define a filter that acts on Cost Allocation Tags.
             
            * Specify the ``Dimensions`` field to define a filter that acts on the `DimensionValues <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_DimensionValues.html>`__.
            

          
           
          * For each filter type, you can set the dimension name and values for the filters that you plan to use. 

            
            * For example, you can filter for ``REGION==us-east-1 OR REGION==us-west-1``. For ``GetRightsizingRecommendation``, the Region is a full name (for example, ``REGION==US East (N. Virginia)``.
             
            * The corresponding ``Expression`` for this example is as follows: ``{ "Dimensions": { "Key": "REGION", "Values": [ "us-east-1", "us-west-1" ] } }``
             
            * As shown in the previous example, lists of dimension values are combined with ``OR`` when applying the filter.
            

          
           
          * You can also set different match options to further control how the filter behaves. Not all APIs support match options. Refer to the documentation for each specific API to see what is supported. 

            
            * For example, you can filter for linked account names that start with "a".
             
            * The corresponding ``Expression`` for this example is as follows: ``{ "Dimensions": { "Key": "LINKED_ACCOUNT_NAME", "MatchOptions": [ "STARTS_WITH" ], "Values": [ "a" ] } }``
            

          
          

        
         
        * Compound ``Expression`` types with logical operations. 

          
          * You can use multiple ``Expression`` types and the logical operators ``AND/OR/NOT`` to create a list of one or more ``Expression`` objects. By doing this, you can filter by more advanced options.
           
          * For example, you can filter by ``((REGION == us-east-1 OR REGION == us-west-1) OR (TAG.Type == Type1)) AND (USAGE_TYPE != DataTransfer)``.
           
          * The corresponding ``Expression`` for this example is as follows: ``{ "And": [ {"Or": [ {"Dimensions": { "Key": "REGION", "Values": [ "us-east-1", "us-west-1" ] }}, {"Tags": { "Key": "TagName", "Values": ["Value1"] } } ]}, {"Not": {"Dimensions": { "Key": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": ["DataTransfer"] }}} ] }``
          

         

        .. note::

          

          Because each ``Expression`` can have only one operator, the service returns an error if more than one is specified. The following example shows an ``Expression`` object that creates an error: ``{ "And": [ ... ], "Dimensions": { "Key": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": [ "DataTransfer" ] } }``

           

          The following is an example of the corresponding error message: ``"Expression has more than one roots. Only one root operator is allowed for each expression: And, Or, Not, Dimensions, Tags, CostCategories"``

          

        
        

         

        .. note::

          

          For the ``GetRightsizingRecommendation`` action, a combination of OR and NOT isn't supported. OR isn't supported between different dimensions, or dimensions and tags. NOT operators aren't supported. Dimensions are also limited to ``LINKED_ACCOUNT``, ``REGION``, or ``RIGHTSIZING_TYPE``.

           

          For the ``GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation`` action, only NOT is supported. AND and OR aren't supported. Dimensions are limited to ``LINKED_ACCOUNT``.

          

        

      
  
    - **And** *(list) --* 

      Return results that match both ``Dimension`` objects.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        Use ``Expression`` to filter in various Cost Explorer APIs.

         

        Not all ``Expression`` types are supported in each API. Refer to the documentation for each specific API to see what is supported.

            * Specify the ``Tags`` field to define a filter that acts on Cost Allocation Tags.
             
            * Specify the ``Dimensions`` field to define a filter that acts on the `DimensionValues <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_DimensionValues.html>`__.
            

          
           
          * For each filter type, you can set the dimension name and values for the filters that you plan to use. 

            
            * For example, you can filter for ``REGION==us-east-1 OR REGION==us-west-1``. For ``GetRightsizingRecommendation``, the Region is a full name (for example, ``REGION==US East (N. Virginia)``.

        * Compound ``Expression`` types with logical operations. 

          
          * You can use multiple ``Expression`` types and the logical operators ``AND/OR/NOT`` to create a list of one or more ``Expression`` objects. By doing this, you can filter by more advanced options.

          Because each ``Expression`` can have only one operator, the service returns an error if more than one is specified. The following example shows an ``Expression`` object that creates an error: ``{ "And": [ ... ], "Dimensions": { "Key": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": [ "DataTransfer" ] } }``

        .. note::

          

          For the ``GetRightsizingRecommendation`` action, a combination of OR and NOT isn't supported. OR isn't supported between different dimensions, or dimensions and tags. NOT operators aren't supported. Dimensions are also limited to ``LINKED_ACCOUNT``, ``REGION``, or ``RIGHTSIZING_TYPE``.

           

          For the ``GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation`` action, only NOT is supported. AND and OR aren't supported. Dimensions are limited to ``LINKED_ACCOUNT``.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **CoveragesByTime** *(list) --* 

        The amount of time that your reservations covered.

        
        

        - *(dict) --*

              The beginning of the time period. The start date is inclusive. For example, if ``start`` is ``2017-01-01``, Amazon Web Services retrieves cost and usage data starting at ``2017-01-01`` up to the end date. The start date must be equal to or no later than the current date to avoid a validation error.

              
            

            - **End** *(string) --* 

              The end of the time period. The end date is exclusive. For example, if ``end`` is ``2017-05-01``, Amazon Web Services retrieves cost and usage data from the start date up to, but not including, ``2017-05-01``.
