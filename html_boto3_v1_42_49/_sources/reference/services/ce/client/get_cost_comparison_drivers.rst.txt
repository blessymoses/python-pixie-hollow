  :type BillingViewArn: string
  :param BillingViewArn: 

    The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies a specific billing view. The ARN is used to specify which particular billing view you want to interact with or retrieve information from when making API calls related to Amazon Web Services Billing and Cost Management features. The BillingViewArn can be retrieved by calling the ListBillingViews API.

    

  
  :type BaselineTimePeriod: dict
  :param BaselineTimePeriod: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The reference time period for comparison. This time period serves as the baseline against which other cost and usage data will be compared. The interval must start and end on the first day of a month, with a duration of exactly one month.

    

  
    - **Start** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The beginning of the time period. The start date is inclusive. For example, if ``start`` is ``2017-01-01``, Amazon Web Services retrieves cost and usage data starting at ``2017-01-01`` up to the end date. The start date must be equal to or no later than the current date to avoid a validation error.

      

    
    - **End** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The end of the time period. The end date is exclusive. For example, if ``end`` is ``2017-05-01``, Amazon Web Services retrieves cost and usage data from the start date up to, but not including, ``2017-05-01``.

      

    
  
  :type ComparisonTimePeriod: dict
  :param ComparisonTimePeriod: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The comparison time period for analysis. This time period's cost and usage data will be compared against the baseline time period. The interval must start and end on the first day of a month, with a duration of exactly one month.

    

  
    - **Start** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The beginning of the time period. The start date is inclusive. For example, if ``start`` is ``2017-01-01``, Amazon Web Services retrieves cost and usage data starting at ``2017-01-01`` up to the end date. The start date must be equal to or no later than the current date to avoid a validation error.

      

    
    - **End** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The end of the time period. The end date is exclusive. For example, if ``end`` is ``2017-05-01``, Amazon Web Services retrieves cost and usage data from the start date up to, but not including, ``2017-05-01``.

      

    
  
  :type MetricForComparison: string
  :param MetricForComparison: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The cost and usage metric to compare. Valid values are ``AmortizedCost``, ``BlendedCost``, ``NetAmortizedCost``, ``NetUnblendedCost``, ``NormalizedUsageAmount``, ``UnblendedCost``, and ``UsageQuantity``.

    

  
  :type Filter: dict
  :param Filter: 

    Use ``Expression`` to filter in various Cost Explorer APIs.

     

    Not all ``Expression`` types are supported in each API. Refer to the documentation for each specific API to see what is supported.

     

    There are two patterns:

     

    
    * Simple dimension values. 

      
      * There are three types of simple dimension values: ``CostCategories``, ``Tags``, and ``Dimensions``. 

        
        * Specify the ``CostCategories`` field to define a filter that acts on Cost Categories.
         
        * Specify the ``Tags`` field to define a filter that acts on Cost Allocation Tags.
         
        * Specify the ``Dimensions`` field to define a filter that acts on the `DimensionValues <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_DimensionValues.html>`__.
        

      
       
      * For each filter type, you can set the dimension name and values for the filters that you plan to use. 

        
        * For example, you can filter for ``REGION==us-east-1 OR REGION==us-west-1``. For ``GetRightsizingRecommendation``, the Region is a full name (for example, ``REGION==US East (N. Virginia)``.
         
        * The corresponding ``Expression`` for this example is as follows: ``{ "Dimensions": { "Key": "REGION", "Values": [ "us-east-1", "us-west-1" ] } }``
         
        * As shown in the previous example, lists of dimension values are combined with ``OR`` when applying the filter.
        

      
       
      * You can also set different match options to further control how the filter behaves. Not all APIs support match options. Refer to the documentation for each specific API to see what is supported. 

        
        * For example, you can filter for linked account names that start with "a".
         
        * The corresponding ``Expression`` for this example is as follows: ``{ "Dimensions": { "Key": "LINKED_ACCOUNT_NAME", "MatchOptions": [ "STARTS_WITH" ], "Values": [ "a" ] } }``
        

      
      

    
     
    * Compound ``Expression`` types with logical operations. 

      
      * You can use multiple ``Expression`` types and the logical operators ``AND/OR/NOT`` to create a list of one or more ``Expression`` objects. By doing this, you can filter by more advanced options.
       
      * For example, you can filter by ``((REGION == us-east-1 OR REGION == us-west-1) OR (TAG.Type == Type1)) AND (USAGE_TYPE != DataTransfer)``.
       
      * The corresponding ``Expression`` for this example is as follows: ``{ "And": [ {"Or": [ {"Dimensions": { "Key": "REGION", "Values": [ "us-east-1", "us-west-1" ] }}, {"Tags": { "Key": "TagName", "Values": ["Value1"] } } ]}, {"Not": {"Dimensions": { "Key": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": ["DataTransfer"] }}} ] }``
      

     

    .. note::

      

      Because each ``Expression`` can have only one operator, the service returns an error if more than one is specified. The following example shows an ``Expression`` object that creates an error: ``{ "And": [ ... ], "Dimensions": { "Key": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": [ "DataTransfer" ] } }``

       

      The following is an example of the corresponding error message: ``"Expression has more than one roots. Only one root operator is allowed for each expression: And, Or, Not, Dimensions, Tags, CostCategories"``

      

    
    

     

    .. note::

      

      For the ``GetRightsizingRecommendation`` action, a combination of OR and NOT isn't supported. OR isn't supported between different dimensions, or dimensions and tags. NOT operators aren't supported. Dimensions are also limited to ``LINKED_ACCOUNT``, ``REGION``, or ``RIGHTSIZING_TYPE``.

       

      For the ``GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation`` action, only NOT is supported. AND and OR aren't supported. Dimensions are limited to ``LINKED_ACCOUNT``.

      

    

  
    - **Or** *(list) --* 

      Return results that match either ``Dimension`` object.

      

    
      - *(dict) --*

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **CostComparisonDrivers** *(list) --* 

        An array of comparison results showing factors that drive significant cost differences between ``BaselineTimePeriod`` and ``ComparisonTimePeriod``.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          Represents a collection of cost drivers and their associated metrics for cost comparison analysis.

          
          

          - **CostSelector** *(dict) --* 

            Use ``Expression`` to filter in various Cost Explorer APIs.

             

            Not all ``Expression`` types are supported in each API. Refer to the documentation for each specific API to see what is supported.

             

            There are two patterns:

             

            
            * Simple dimension values. 

              
              * There are three types of simple dimension values: ``CostCategories``, ``Tags``, and ``Dimensions``. 

                
                * Specify the ``CostCategories`` field to define a filter that acts on Cost Categories.
                 
                * Specify the ``Tags`` field to define a filter that acts on Cost Allocation Tags.
                 
                * Specify the ``Dimensions`` field to define a filter that acts on the `DimensionValues <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_DimensionValues.html>`__.
                

              
               
              * For each filter type, you can set the dimension name and values for the filters that you plan to use. 

                
                * For example, you can filter for ``REGION==us-east-1 OR REGION==us-west-1``. For ``GetRightsizingRecommendation``, the Region is a full name (for example, ``REGION==US East (N. Virginia)``.
                 
                * The corresponding ``Expression`` for this example is as follows: ``{ "Dimensions": { "Key": "REGION", "Values": [ "us-east-1", "us-west-1" ] } }``
                 
                * As shown in the previous example, lists of dimension values are combined with ``OR`` when applying the filter.
                

              
               
              * You can also set different match options to further control how the filter behaves. Not all APIs support match options. Refer to the documentation for each specific API to see what is supported. 

                
                * For example, you can filter for linked account names that start with "a".
                 
                * The corresponding ``Expression`` for this example is as follows: ``{ "Dimensions": { "Key": "LINKED_ACCOUNT_NAME", "MatchOptions": [ "STARTS_WITH" ], "Values": [ "a" ] } }``
                

              
              

            
             
            * Compound ``Expression`` types with logical operations. 

              
              * You can use multiple ``Expression`` types and the logical operators ``AND/OR/NOT`` to create a list of one or more ``Expression`` objects. By doing this, you can filter by more advanced options.
               
              * For example, you can filter by ``((REGION == us-east-1 OR REGION == us-west-1) OR (TAG.Type == Type1)) AND (USAGE_TYPE != DataTransfer)``.
               
              * The corresponding ``Expression`` for this example is as follows: ``{ "And": [ {"Or": [ {"Dimensions": { "Key": "REGION", "Values": [ "us-east-1", "us-west-1" ] }}, {"Tags": { "Key": "TagName", "Values": ["Value1"] } } ]}, {"Not": {"Dimensions": { "Key": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": ["DataTransfer"] }}} ] }``
              

             

            .. note::

              

              Because each ``Expression`` can have only one operator, the service returns an error if more than one is specified. The following example shows an ``Expression`` object that creates an error: ``{ "And": [ ... ], "Dimensions": { "Key": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": [ "DataTransfer" ] } }``

               

              The following is an example of the corresponding error message: ``"Expression has more than one roots. Only one root operator is allowed for each expression: And, Or, Not, Dimensions, Tags, CostCategories"``

              

            
            

             

            .. note::

              

              For the ``GetRightsizingRecommendation`` action, a combination of OR and NOT isn't supported. OR isn't supported between different dimensions, or dimensions and tags. NOT operators aren't supported. Dimensions are also limited to ``LINKED_ACCOUNT``, ``REGION``, or ``RIGHTSIZING_TYPE``.

               

              For the ``GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation`` action, only NOT is supported. AND and OR aren't supported. Dimensions are limited to ``LINKED_ACCOUNT``.

              

            
            

            - **Or** *(list) --* 

              Return results that match either ``Dimension`` object.

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                Use ``Expression`` to filter in various Cost Explorer APIs.

                  * For example, you can filter by ``((REGION == us-east-1 OR REGION == us-west-1) OR (TAG.Type == Type1)) AND (USAGE_TYPE != DataTransfer)``.
                   
                  * The corresponding ``Expression`` for this example is as follows: ``{ "And": [ {"Or": [ {"Dimensions": { "Key": "REGION", "Values": [ "us-east-1", "us-west-1" ] }}, {"Tags": { "Key": "TagName", "Values": ["Value1"] } } ]}, {"Not": {"Dimensions": { "Key": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": ["DataTransfer"] }}} ] }``
                  

                 

                .. note::

                  

                  Because each ``Expression`` can have only one operator, the service returns an error if more than one is specified. The following example shows an ``Expression`` object that creates an error: ``{ "And": [ ... ], "Dimensions": { "Key": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": [ "DataTransfer" ] } }``

                   

                  The following is an example of the corresponding error message: ``"Expression has more than one roots. Only one root operator is allowed for each expression: And, Or, Not, Dimensions, Tags, CostCategories"``

                  

                
                

                 

                .. note::

                  

                  For the ``GetRightsizingRecommendation`` action, a combination of OR and NOT isn't supported. OR isn't supported between different dimensions, or dimensions and tags.
