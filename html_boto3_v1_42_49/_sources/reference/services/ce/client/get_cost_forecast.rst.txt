  :type TimePeriod: dict
  :param TimePeriod: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The period of time that you want the forecast to cover. The start date must be equal to or no later than the current date to avoid a validation error.

    

  
    - **Start** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The beginning of the time period. The start date is inclusive. For example, if ``start`` is ``2017-01-01``, Amazon Web Services retrieves cost and usage data starting at ``2017-01-01`` up to the end date. The start date must be equal to or no later than the current date to avoid a validation error.

      

    
    - **End** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The end of the time period. The end date is exclusive. For example, if ``end`` is ``2017-05-01``, Amazon Web Services retrieves cost and usage data from the start date up to, but not including, ``2017-05-01``.

      

    
  
  :type Metric: string
  :param Metric: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Which metric Cost Explorer uses to create your forecast. For more information about blended and unblended rates, see `Why does the "blended" annotation appear on some line items in my bill? <http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/blended-rates-intro/>`__.

     

    Valid values for a ``GetCostForecast`` call are the following:

     

    
    * AMORTIZED_COST
     
    * BLENDED_COST
     
    * NET_AMORTIZED_COST
     
    * NET_UNBLENDED_COST
     
    * UNBLENDED_COST
    

    

  
  :type Granularity: string
  :param Granularity: **[REQUIRED]** 

    How granular you want the forecast to be. You can get 3 months of ``DAILY`` forecasts or 18 months of ``MONTHLY`` forecasts.

     

    The ``GetCostForecast`` operation supports only ``DAILY`` and ``MONTHLY`` granularities.

    

  
  :type Filter: dict
  :param Filter: 

    The filters that you want to use to filter your forecast. The ``GetCostForecast`` API supports filtering by the following dimensions:

     

    
    * ``AZ``
     
    * ``INSTANCE_TYPE``
     
    * ``LINKED_ACCOUNT``
     
    * ``OPERATION``
     
    * ``PURCHASE_TYPE``
     
    * ``REGION``
     
    * ``SERVICE``
     
    * ``USAGE_TYPE``
     
    * ``USAGE_TYPE_GROUP``
     
    * ``RECORD_TYPE``
     
    * ``OPERATING_SYSTEM``
     
    * ``TENANCY``
     
    * ``SCOPE``
     
    * ``PLATFORM``
     
    * ``SUBSCRIPTION_ID``
     
    * ``LEGAL_ENTITY_NAME``
     
    * ``DEPLOYMENT_OPTION``
     
    * ``DATABASE_ENGINE``
     
    * ``INSTANCE_TYPE_FAMILY``
     
    * ``BILLING_ENTITY``
     
    * ``RESERVATION_ID``
     
    * ``SAVINGS_PLAN_ARN``
    

    

  
    - **Or** *(list) --* 

      Return results that match either ``Dimension`` object.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        Use ``Expression`` to filter in various Cost Explorer APIs.

         

        Not all ``Expression`` types are supported in each API. Refer to the documentation for each specific API to see what is supported.

         

        There are two patterns:

         

        
        * Simple dimension values. 

          
          * There are three types of simple dimension values: ``CostCategories``, ``Tags``, and ``Dimensions``. 

            
            * Specify the ``CostCategories`` field to define a filter that acts on Cost Categories.
             
            * Specify the ``Tags`` field to define a filter that acts on Cost Allocation Tags.
             
            * Specify the ``Dimensions`` field to define a filter that acts on the `DimensionValues <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_DimensionValues.html>`__.
            

          
           
          * For each filter type, you can set the dimension name and values for the filters that you plan to use. 

            
            * For example, you can filter for ``REGION==us-east-1 OR REGION==us-west-1``. For ``GetRightsizingRecommendation``, the Region is a full name (for example, ``REGION==US East (N. Virginia)``.
             
            * The corresponding ``Expression`` for this example is as follows: ``{ "Dimensions": { "Key": "REGION", "Values": [ "us-east-1", "us-west-1" ] } }``
             
            * As shown in the previous example, lists of dimension values are combined with ``OR`` when applying the filter.
            

          
           
          * You can also set different match options to further control how the filter behaves. Not all APIs support match options. Refer to the documentation for each specific API to see what is supported. 

            
            * For example, you can filter for linked account names that start with "a".
             
            * The corresponding ``Expression`` for this example is as follows: ``{ "Dimensions": { "Key": "LINKED_ACCOUNT_NAME", "MatchOptions": [ "STARTS_WITH" ], "Values": [ "a" ] } }``
            

          
          

        
         
        * Compound ``Expression`` types with logical operations. 

          
          * You can use multiple ``Expression`` types and the logical operators ``AND/OR/NOT`` to create a list of one or more ``Expression`` objects. By doing this, you can filter by more advanced options.
           
          * For example, you can filter by ``((REGION == us-east-1 OR REGION == us-west-1) OR (TAG.Type == Type1)) AND (USAGE_TYPE != DataTransfer)``.
           
          * The corresponding ``Expression`` for this example is as follows: ``{ "And": [ {"Or": [ {"Dimensions": { "Key": "REGION", "Values": [ "us-east-1", "us-west-1" ] }}, {"Tags": { "Key": "TagName", "Values": ["Value1"] } } ]}, {"Not": {"Dimensions": { "Key": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": ["DataTransfer"] }}} ] }``
          

         

        .. note::

          

          Because each ``Expression`` can have only one operator, the service returns an error if more than one is specified. The following example shows an ``Expression`` object that creates an error: ``{ "And": [ ... ], "Dimensions": { "Key": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": [ "DataTransfer" ] } }``

           

          The following is an example of the corresponding error message: ``"Expression has more than one roots. Only one root operator is allowed for each expression: And, Or, Not, Dimensions, Tags, CostCategories"``

          

        
        

         

        .. note::

          

          For the ``GetRightsizingRecommendation`` action, a combination of OR and NOT isn't supported. OR isn't supported between different dimensions, or dimensions and tags. NOT operators aren't supported. Dimensions are also limited to ``LINKED_ACCOUNT``, ``REGION``, or ``RIGHTSIZING_TYPE``.

           

          For the ``GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation`` action, only NOT is supported. AND and OR aren't supported. Dimensions are limited to ``LINKED_ACCOUNT``.

          

        

      
  
    - **And** *(list) --* 

      Return results that match both ``Dimension`` objects.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        Use ``Expression`` to filter in various Cost Explorer APIs.

          * For each filter type, you can set the dimension name and values for the filters that you plan to use. 

            
            * For example, you can filter for ``REGION==us-east-1 OR REGION==us-west-1``. For ``GetRightsizingRecommendation``, the Region is a full name (for example, ``REGION==US East (N. Virginia)``.

    - **Not** *(dict) --* 

      Return results that don't match a ``Dimension`` object.

      

    
    - **Dimensions** *(dict) --* 

      The specific ``Dimension`` to use for ``Expression``.

      

    
      - **Key** *(string) --*

  :type BillingViewArn: string
  :param BillingViewArn: 

    The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies a specific billing view. The ARN is used to specify which particular billing view you want to interact with or retrieve information from when making API calls related to Amazon Web Services Billing and Cost Management features. The BillingViewArn can be retrieved by calling the ListBillingViews API.

    

  
  :type PredictionIntervalLevel: integer
  :param PredictionIntervalLevel: 

    Cost Explorer always returns the mean forecast as a single point. You can request a prediction interval around the mean by specifying a confidence level. The higher the confidence level, the more confident Cost Explorer is about the actual value falling in the prediction interval. Higher confidence levels result in wider prediction intervals.
