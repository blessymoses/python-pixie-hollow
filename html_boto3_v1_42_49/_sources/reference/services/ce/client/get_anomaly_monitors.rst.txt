    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **AnomalyMonitors** *(list) --* 

        A list of cost anomaly monitors that includes the detailed metadata for each monitor.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          This object continuously inspects your account's cost data for anomalies. It's based on ``MonitorType`` and ``MonitorSpecification``. The content consists of detailed metadata and the current status of the monitor object.

          
          

          - **MonitorArn** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) value.

            
          

          - **MonitorName** *(string) --* 

            The name of the monitor.

            
          

          - **CreationDate** *(string) --* 

            The date when the monitor was created.

            
          

          - **LastUpdatedDate** *(string) --* 

            The date when the monitor was last updated.

            
          

          - **LastEvaluatedDate** *(string) --* 

            The date when the monitor last evaluated for anomalies.

            
          

          - **MonitorType** *(string) --* 

            The type of the monitor.

             

            Set this to ``DIMENSIONAL`` for an Amazon Web Services managed monitor. Amazon Web Services managed monitors automatically track up to the top 5,000 values by cost within a dimension of your choosing. Each dimension value is evaluated independently. If you start incurring cost in a new value of your chosen dimension, it will automatically be analyzed by an Amazon Web Services managed monitor.

             

            Set this to ``CUSTOM`` for a customer managed monitor. Customer managed monitors let you select specific dimension values that get monitored in aggregate.

             

            For more information about monitor types, see `Monitor types <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/latest/userguide/getting-started-ad.html#monitor-type-def>`__ in the *Billing and Cost Management User Guide*.

            
          

          - **MonitorDimension** *(string) --* 

            For customer managed monitors, do not specify this field.

             

            For Amazon Web Services managed monitors, this field controls which cost dimension is automatically analyzed by the monitor. For ``TAG`` and ``COST_CATEGORY`` dimensions, you must also specify MonitorSpecification to configure the specific tag or cost category key to analyze.

            
          

          - **MonitorSpecification** *(dict) --* 

            An `Expression <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_Expression.html>`__ object used to control what costs the monitor analyzes for anomalies.

             

            For Amazon Web Services managed monitors:

             

            
            * If MonitorDimension is ``SERVICE`` or ``LINKED_ACCOUNT``, do not specify this field
             
            * If MonitorDimension is ``TAG``, set this field to ``{ "Tags": { "Key": "your tag key" } }``
             
            * If MonitorDimension is ``COST_CATEGORY``, set this field to ``{ "CostCategories": { "Key": "your cost category key" } }``
            

             

            For customer managed monitors:

             

            
            * To track linked accounts, set this field to ``{ "Dimensions": { "Key": "LINKED_ACCOUNT", "Values": [ "your list of up to 10 account IDs" ] } }``
             
            * To track cost allocation tags, set this field to ``{ "Tags": { "Key": "your tag key", "Values": [ "your list of up to 10 tag values" ] } }``
             
            * To track cost categories, set this field to ``{ "CostCategories": { "Key": "your cost category key", "Values": [ "your cost category value" ] } }``
            

            
            

            - **Or** *(list) --* 

              Return results that match either ``Dimension`` object.

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                Use ``Expression`` to filter in various Cost Explorer APIs.

                 

                Not all ``Expression`` types are supported in each API. Refer to the documentation for each specific API to see what is supported.

                 

                There are two patterns:

                 

                
                * Simple dimension values. 

                  
                  * There are three types of simple dimension values: ``CostCategories``, ``Tags``, and ``Dimensions``. 

                    
                    * Specify the ``CostCategories`` field to define a filter that acts on Cost Categories.
                     
                    * Specify the ``Tags`` field to define a filter that acts on Cost Allocation Tags.
                     
                    * Specify the ``Dimensions`` field to define a filter that acts on the `DimensionValues <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_DimensionValues.html>`__.
                    

                  
                   
                  * For each filter type, you can set the dimension name and values for the filters that you plan to use. 

                    
                    * For example, you can filter for ``REGION==us-east-1 OR REGION==us-west-1``. For ``GetRightsizingRecommendation``, the Region is a full name (for example, ``REGION==US East (N. Virginia)``.
                     
                    * The corresponding ``Expression`` for this example is as follows: ``{ "Dimensions": { "Key": "REGION", "Values": [ "us-east-1", "us-west-1" ] } }``
                     
                    * As shown in the previous example, lists of dimension values are combined with ``OR`` when applying the filter.
                    

                  
                   
                  * You can also set different match options to further control how the filter behaves. Not all APIs support match options. Refer to the documentation for each specific API to see what is supported. 

                    
                    * For example, you can filter for linked account names that start with "a".
                     
                    * The corresponding ``Expression`` for this example is as follows: ``{ "Dimensions": { "Key": "LINKED_ACCOUNT_NAME", "MatchOptions": [ "STARTS_WITH" ], "Values": [ "a" ] } }``
                    

                  
                  

                
                 
                * Compound ``Expression`` types with logical operations. 

                  
                  * You can use multiple ``Expression`` types and the logical operators ``AND/OR/NOT`` to create a list of one or more ``Expression`` objects. By doing this, you can filter by more advanced options.
                   
                  * For example, you can filter by ``((REGION == us-east-1 OR REGION == us-west-1) OR (TAG.Type == Type1)) AND (USAGE_TYPE != DataTransfer)``.
                   
                  * The corresponding ``Expression`` for this example is as follows: ``{ "And": [ {"Or": [ {"Dimensions": { "Key": "REGION", "Values": [ "us-east-1", "us-west-1" ] }}, {"Tags": { "Key": "TagName", "Values": ["Value1"] } } ]}, {"Not": {"Dimensions": { "Key": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": ["DataTransfer"] }}} ] }``
                  

                 

                .. note::

                  

                  Because each ``Expression`` can have only one operator, the service returns an error if more than one is specified. The following example shows an ``Expression`` object that creates an error: ``{ "And": [ ... ], "Dimensions": { "Key": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": [ "DataTransfer" ] } }``

                   

                  The following is an example of the corresponding error message: ``"Expression has more than one roots. Only one root operator is allowed for each expression: And, Or, Not, Dimensions, Tags, CostCategories"``

                  

                
                

                 

                .. note::

                  

                  For the ``GetRightsizingRecommendation`` action, a combination of OR and NOT isn't supported. OR isn't supported between different dimensions, or dimensions and tags. NOT operators aren't supported. Dimensions are also limited to ``LINKED_ACCOUNT``, ``REGION``, or ``RIGHTSIZING_TYPE``.

                   

                  For the ``GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation`` action, only NOT is supported. AND and OR aren't supported. Dimensions are limited to ``LINKED_ACCOUNT``.

                  

                
          
            

            - **And** *(list) --* 

              Return results that match both ``Dimension`` objects.

                  * For each filter type, you can set the dimension name and values for the filters that you plan to use. 

                    
                    * For example, you can filter for ``REGION==us-east-1 OR REGION==us-west-1``. For ``GetRightsizingRecommendation``, the Region is a full name (for example, ``REGION==US East (N. Virginia)``.
