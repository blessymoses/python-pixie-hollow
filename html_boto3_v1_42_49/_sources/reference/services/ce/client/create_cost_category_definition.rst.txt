  :type Name: string
  :param Name: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The unique name of the cost category.

    

  
  :type EffectiveStart: string
  :param EffectiveStart: 

    The cost category's effective start date. It can only be a billing start date (first day of the month). If the date isn't provided, it's the first day of the current month. Dates can't be before the previous twelve months, or in the future.

    

  
  :type RuleVersion: string
  :param RuleVersion: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The rule schema version in this particular cost category.

    

  
  :type Rules: list
  :param Rules: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The cost category rules used to categorize costs. For more information, see `CostCategoryRule <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_CostCategoryRule.html>`__.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      Rules are processed in order. If there are multiple rules that match the line item, then the first rule to match is used to determine that cost category value.

      

    
      - **Value** *(string) --* 

        The default value for the cost category.

        

      
      - **Rule** *(dict) --* 

        An `Expression <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_Expression.html>`__ object used to categorize costs. This supports dimensions, tags, and nested expressions. Currently the only dimensions supported are ``LINKED_ACCOUNT``, ``SERVICE_CODE``, ``RECORD_TYPE``, ``LINKED_ACCOUNT_NAME``, ``REGION``, and ``USAGE_TYPE``.

         

        ``RECORD_TYPE`` is a dimension used for Cost Explorer APIs, and is also supported for cost category expressions. This dimension uses different terms, depending on whether you're using the console or API/JSON editor. For a detailed comparison, see `Term Comparisons <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/manage-cost-categories.html#cost-categories-terms>`__ in the *Billing and Cost Management User Guide*.

        

      
        - **Or** *(list) --* 

          Return results that match either ``Dimension`` object.

          

        
          - *(dict) --* 

            Use ``Expression`` to filter in various Cost Explorer APIs.

             

            Not all ``Expression`` types are supported in each API. Refer to the documentation for each specific API to see what is supported.

             

            There are two patterns:

             

            
            * Simple dimension values. 

              
              * There are three types of simple dimension values: ``CostCategories``, ``Tags``, and ``Dimensions``. 

                
                * Specify the ``CostCategories`` field to define a filter that acts on Cost Categories.
                 
                * Specify the ``Tags`` field to define a filter that acts on Cost Allocation Tags.
                 
                * Specify the ``Dimensions`` field to define a filter that acts on the `DimensionValues <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_DimensionValues.html>`__.
                

              
               
              * For each filter type, you can set the dimension name and values for the filters that you plan to use. 

                
                * For example, you can filter for ``REGION==us-east-1 OR REGION==us-west-1``. For ``GetRightsizingRecommendation``, the Region is a full name (for example, ``REGION==US East (N. Virginia)``.
                 
                * The corresponding ``Expression`` for this example is as follows: ``{ "Dimensions": { "Key": "REGION", "Values": [ "us-east-1", "us-west-1" ] } }``
                 
                * As shown in the previous example, lists of dimension values are combined with ``OR`` when applying the filter.
                

              
               
              * You can also set different match options to further control how the filter behaves. Not all APIs support match options. Refer to the documentation for each specific API to see what is supported. 

                
                * For example, you can filter for linked account names that start with "a".
                 
                * The corresponding ``Expression`` for this example is as follows: ``{ "Dimensions": { "Key": "LINKED_ACCOUNT_NAME", "MatchOptions": [ "STARTS_WITH" ], "Values": [ "a" ] } }``
                

              
              

            
             
            * Compound ``Expression`` types with logical operations. 

              
              * You can use multiple ``Expression`` types and the logical operators ``AND/OR/NOT`` to create a list of one or more ``Expression`` objects. By doing this, you can filter by more advanced options.
               
              * For example, you can filter by ``((REGION == us-east-1 OR REGION == us-west-1) OR (TAG.Type == Type1)) AND (USAGE_TYPE != DataTransfer)``.
               
              * The corresponding ``Expression`` for this example is as follows: ``{ "And": [ {"Or": [ {"Dimensions": { "Key": "REGION", "Values": [ "us-east-1", "us-west-1" ] }}, {"Tags": { "Key": "TagName", "Values": ["Value1"] } } ]}, {"Not": {"Dimensions": { "Key": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": ["DataTransfer"] }}} ] }``
              

             

            .. note::

              

              Because each ``Expression`` can have only one operator, the service returns an error if more than one is specified. The following example shows an ``Expression`` object that creates an error: ``{ "And": [ ... ], "Dimensions": { "Key": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": [ "DataTransfer" ] } }``

               

              The following is an example of the corresponding error message: ``"Expression has more than one roots. Only one root operator is allowed for each expression: And, Or, Not, Dimensions, Tags, CostCategories"``

              

            
            

             

            .. note::

              

              For the ``GetRightsizingRecommendation`` action, a combination of OR and NOT isn't supported. OR isn't supported between different dimensions, or dimensions and tags. NOT operators aren't supported. Dimensions are also limited to ``LINKED_ACCOUNT``, ``REGION``, or ``RIGHTSIZING_TYPE``.

               

              For the ``GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation`` action, only NOT is supported. AND and OR aren't supported. Dimensions are limited to ``LINKED_ACCOUNT``.

              

            

          
      
        - **And** *(list) --* 

          Return results that match both ``Dimension`` objects.

          

        
          - *(dict) --* 

            Use ``Expression`` to filter in various Cost Explorer APIs.

            - *(string) --* 

            
        
        
      
      - **InheritedValue** *(dict) --* 

        The value the line item is categorized as if the line item contains the matched dimension.

        

      
        - **DimensionName** *(string) --* 

          The name of the dimension that's used to group costs.

           

          If you specify ``LINKED_ACCOUNT_NAME``, the cost category value is based on account name. If you specify ``TAG``, the cost category value is based on the value of the specified tag key.

          

        
        - **DimensionKey** *(string) --* 

          The key to extract cost category values.

          

        
      
      - **Type** *(string) --* 

        You can define the ``CostCategoryRule`` rule type as either ``REGULAR`` or ``INHERITED_VALUE``. The ``INHERITED_VALUE`` rule type adds the flexibility to define a rule that dynamically inherits the cost category value. This value is from the dimension value that's defined by ``CostCategoryInheritedValueDimension``. For example, suppose that you want to costs to be dynamically grouped based on the value of a specific tag key. First, choose an inherited value rule type, and then choose the tag dimension and specify the tag key to use.

        

      
    

  :type DefaultValue: string
  :param DefaultValue:

    - *(dict) --* 

      Use the split charge rule to split the cost of one cost category value across several other target values.

      

    
      - **Source** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The cost category value that you want to split. That value can't be used as a source or a target in other split charge rules. To indicate uncategorized costs, you can use an empty string as the source.

        

      
      - **Targets** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The cost category values that you want to split costs across. These values can't be used as a source in other split charge rules.

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
    
      - **Method** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The method that's used to define how to split your source costs across your targets.

         

        ``Proportional`` - Allocates charges across your targets based on the proportional weighted cost of each target.

         

        ``Fixed`` - Allocates charges across your targets based on your defined allocation percentage.

         

        > ``Even`` - Allocates costs evenly across all targets.

        

      
      - **Parameters** *(list) --* 

        The parameters for a split charge method. This is only required for the ``FIXED`` method.

        

      
        - *(dict) --* 

          The parameters for a split charge method.

          

        
          - **Type** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The parameter type.

            

          
          - **Values** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The parameter values.

            

          
            - *(string) --* 

            
        
        
    
    

  :type ResourceTags: list
  :param ResourceTags: 

    An optional list of tags to associate with the specified `CostCategory <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_CostCategory.html>`__. You can use resource tags to control access to your ``cost category`` using IAM policies.

     

    Each tag consists of a key and a value, and each key must be unique for the resource. The following restrictions apply to resource tags:

     

    
    * Although the maximum number of array members is 200, you can assign a maximum of 50 user-tags to one resource. The remaining are reserved for Amazon Web Services use
     
    * The maximum length of a key is 128 characters
     
    * The maximum length of a value is 256 characters
     
    * Keys and values can only contain alphanumeric characters, spaces, and any of the following: ``_.:/=+@-``
     
    * Keys and values are case sensitive
     
    * Keys and values are trimmed for any leading or trailing whitespaces
     
    * Don’t use ``aws:`` as a prefix for your keys. This prefix is reserved for Amazon Web Services use
    

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      The tag structure that contains a tag key and value.

       

      .. note::

        

        Tagging is supported only for the following Cost Explorer resource types: `AnomalyMonitor <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_AnomalyMonitor.html>`__, `AnomalySubscription <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_AnomalySubscription.html>`__, `CostCategory <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_CostCategory.html>`__.

        

      

    
      - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**
