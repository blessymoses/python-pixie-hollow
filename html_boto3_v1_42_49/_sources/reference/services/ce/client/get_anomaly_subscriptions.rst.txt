    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **AnomalySubscriptions** *(list) --* 

        A list of cost anomaly subscriptions that includes the detailed metadata for each one.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          An ``AnomalySubscription`` resource (also referred to as an alert subscription) sends notifications about specific anomalies that meet an alerting criteria defined by you.

           

          You can specify the frequency of the alerts and the subscribers to notify.

           

          Anomaly subscriptions can be associated with one or more `AnomalyMonitor <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_AnomalyMonitor.html>`__ resources, and they only send notifications about anomalies detected by those associated monitors. You can also configure a threshold to further control which anomalies are included in the notifications.

           

          Anomalies that don’t exceed the chosen threshold and therefore don’t trigger notifications from an anomaly subscription will still be available on the console and from the `GetAnomalies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_GetAnomalies.html>`__ API.

          
          

          - **SubscriptionArn** *(string) --* 

            The ``AnomalySubscription`` Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

            
          

          - **AccountId** *(string) --* 

            Your unique account identifier.

            
          

          - **MonitorArnList** *(list) --* 

            A list of cost anomaly monitors.

            
            

            - *(string) --* 
        
          

          - **Subscribers** *(list) --* 

            A list of subscribers to notify.

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

              The recipient of ``AnomalySubscription`` notifications.

              
              

              - **Address** *(string) --* 

                The email address or SNS Amazon Resource Name (ARN). This depends on the ``Type``.

                
              

              - **Type** *(string) --* 

                The notification delivery channel.

                
              

              - **Status** *(string) --* 

                Indicates if the subscriber accepts the notifications.

                
          
        
          

          - **Threshold** *(float) --* 

            (deprecated)

             

            An absolute dollar value that must be exceeded by the anomaly's total impact (see `Impact <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_Impact.html>`__ for more details) for an anomaly notification to be generated.

             

            This field has been deprecated. To specify a threshold, use ThresholdExpression. Continued use of Threshold will be treated as shorthand syntax for a ThresholdExpression.

             

            One of Threshold or ThresholdExpression is required for this resource. You cannot specify both.

            
          

          - **Frequency** *(string) --* 

            The frequency that anomaly notifications are sent. Notifications are sent either over email (for DAILY and WEEKLY frequencies) or SNS (for IMMEDIATE frequency). For more information, see `Creating an Amazon SNS topic for anomaly notifications <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/latest/userguide/ad-SNS.html>`__.

            
          

          - **SubscriptionName** *(string) --* 

            The name for the subscription.

            
          

          - **ThresholdExpression** *(dict) --* 

            An `Expression <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_Expression.html>`__ object used to specify the anomalies that you want to generate alerts for. This supports dimensions and nested expressions. The supported dimensions are ``ANOMALY_TOTAL_IMPACT_ABSOLUTE`` and ``ANOMALY_TOTAL_IMPACT_PERCENTAGE``, corresponding to an anomaly’s TotalImpact and TotalImpactPercentage, respectively (see `Impact <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_Impact.html>`__ for more details). The supported nested expression types are ``AND`` and ``OR``. The match option ``GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL`` is required. Values must be numbers between 0 and 10,000,000,000 in string format.

             

            One of Threshold or ThresholdExpression is required for this resource. You cannot specify both.

             

            The following are examples of valid ThresholdExpressions:

             

            
            * Absolute threshold: ``{ "Dimensions": { "Key": "ANOMALY_TOTAL_IMPACT_ABSOLUTE", "MatchOptions": [ "GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL" ], "Values": [ "100" ] } }``
             
            * Percentage threshold: ``{ "Dimensions": { "Key": "ANOMALY_TOTAL_IMPACT_PERCENTAGE", "MatchOptions": [ "GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL" ], "Values": [ "100" ] } }``
             
            * ``AND`` two thresholds together: ``{ "And": [ { "Dimensions": { "Key": "ANOMALY_TOTAL_IMPACT_ABSOLUTE", "MatchOptions": [ "GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL" ], "Values": [ "100" ] } }, { "Dimensions": { "Key": "ANOMALY_TOTAL_IMPACT_PERCENTAGE", "MatchOptions": [ "GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL" ], "Values": [ "100" ] } } ] }``
             
            * ``OR`` two thresholds together: ``{ "Or": [ { "Dimensions": { "Key": "ANOMALY_TOTAL_IMPACT_ABSOLUTE", "MatchOptions": [ "GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL" ], "Values": [ "100" ] } }, { "Dimensions": { "Key": "ANOMALY_TOTAL_IMPACT_PERCENTAGE", "MatchOptions": [ "GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL" ], "Values": [ "100" ] } } ] }``
            

            
            

            - **Or** *(list) --* 

              Return results that match either ``Dimension`` object.

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                Use ``Expression`` to filter in various Cost Explorer APIs.

                 

                Not all ``Expression`` types are supported in each API. Refer to the documentation for each specific API to see what is supported.

                 

                There are two patterns:

                 

                
                * Simple dimension values. 

                  
                  * There are three types of simple dimension values: ``CostCategories``, ``Tags``, and ``Dimensions``. 

                    
                    * Specify the ``CostCategories`` field to define a filter that acts on Cost Categories.
                     
                    * Specify the ``Tags`` field to define a filter that acts on Cost Allocation Tags.
                     
                    * Specify the ``Dimensions`` field to define a filter that acts on the `DimensionValues <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_DimensionValues.html>`__.
                    

                  
                   
                  * For each filter type, you can set the dimension name and values for the filters that you plan to use. 

                    
                    * For example, you can filter for ``REGION==us-east-1 OR REGION==us-west-1``. For ``GetRightsizingRecommendation``, the Region is a full name (for example, ``REGION==US East (N. Virginia)``.
                     
                    * The corresponding ``Expression`` for this example is as follows: ``{ "Dimensions": { "Key": "REGION", "Values": [ "us-east-1", "us-west-1" ] } }``
                     
                    * As shown in the previous example, lists of dimension values are combined with ``OR`` when applying the filter.
                    

                  
                   
                  * You can also set different match options to further control how the filter behaves. Not all APIs support match options. Refer to the documentation for each specific API to see what is supported. 

                    
                    * For example, you can filter for linked account names that start with "a".
                     
                    * The corresponding ``Expression`` for this example is as follows: ``{ "Dimensions": { "Key": "LINKED_ACCOUNT_NAME", "MatchOptions": [ "STARTS_WITH" ], "Values": [ "a" ] } }``
                    

                  
                  

                
                 
                * Compound ``Expression`` types with logical operations. 

                  
                  * You can use multiple ``Expression`` types and the logical operators ``AND/OR/NOT`` to create a list of one or more ``Expression`` objects. By doing this, you can filter by more advanced options.
                   
                  * For example, you can filter by ``((REGION == us-east-1 OR REGION == us-west-1) OR (TAG.Type == Type1)) AND (USAGE_TYPE != DataTransfer)``.
                   
                  * The corresponding ``Expression`` for this example is as follows: ``{ "And": [ {"Or": [ {"Dimensions": { "Key": "REGION", "Values": [ "us-east-1", "us-west-1" ] }}, {"Tags": { "Key": "TagName", "Values": ["Value1"] } } ]}, {"Not": {"Dimensions": { "Key": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": ["DataTransfer"] }}} ] }``
                  

                 

                .. note::

                  

                  Because each ``Expression`` can have only one operator, the service returns an error if more than one is specified. The following example shows an ``Expression`` object that creates an error: ``{ "And": [ ... ], "Dimensions": { "Key": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": [ "DataTransfer" ] } }``

                   

                  The following is an example of the corresponding error message: ``"Expression has more than one roots. Only one root operator is allowed for each expression: And, Or, Not, Dimensions, Tags, CostCategories"``

                  

                
                

                 

                .. note::

                  

                  For the ``GetRightsizingRecommendation`` action, a combination of OR and NOT isn't supported. OR isn't supported between different dimensions, or dimensions and tags. NOT operators aren't supported. Dimensions are also limited to ``LINKED_ACCOUNT``, ``REGION``, or ``RIGHTSIZING_TYPE``.

                   

                  For the ``GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation`` action, only NOT is supported. AND and OR aren't supported. Dimensions are limited to ``LINKED_ACCOUNT``.

                  

                
          
            

            - **And** *(list) --* 

              Return results that match both ``Dimension`` objects.

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                Use ``Expression`` to filter in various Cost Explorer APIs.

                 

                Not all ``Expression`` types are supported in each API. Refer to the documentation for each specific API to see what is supported.

                  * For each filter type, you can set the dimension name and values for the filters that you plan to use. 

                    
                    * For example, you can filter for ``REGION==us-east-1 OR REGION==us-west-1``. For ``GetRightsizingRecommendation``, the Region is a full name (for example, ``REGION==US East (N. Virginia)``.

                * Compound ``Expression`` types with logical operations. 

                  
                  * You can use multiple ``Expression`` types and the logical operators ``AND/OR/NOT`` to create a list of one or more ``Expression`` objects. By doing this, you can filter by more advanced options.
                   
                  * For example, you can filter by ``((REGION == us-east-1 OR REGION == us-west-1) OR (TAG.Type == Type1)) AND (USAGE_TYPE != DataTransfer)``.
                   
                  * The corresponding ``Expression`` for this example is as follows: ``{ "And": [ {"Or": [ {"Dimensions": { "Key": "REGION", "Values": [ "us-east-1", "us-west-1" ] }}, {"Tags": { "Key": "TagName", "Values": ["Value1"] } } ]}, {"Not": {"Dimensions": { "Key": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": ["DataTransfer"] }}} ] }``
                  

                 

                .. note::

                  

                  Because each ``Expression`` can have only one operator, the service returns an error if more than one is specified. The following example shows an ``Expression`` object that creates an error: ``{ "And": [ ... ], "Dimensions": { "Key": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": [ "DataTransfer" ] } }``

                   

                  The following is an example of the corresponding error message: ``"Expression has more than one roots. Only one root operator is allowed for each expression: And, Or, Not, Dimensions, Tags, CostCategories"``

                  

                
                

                 

                .. note::

                  

                  For the ``GetRightsizingRecommendation`` action, a combination of OR and NOT isn't supported. OR isn't supported between different dimensions, or dimensions and tags. NOT operators aren't supported. Dimensions are also limited to ``LINKED_ACCOUNT``, ``REGION``, or ``RIGHTSIZING_TYPE``.
