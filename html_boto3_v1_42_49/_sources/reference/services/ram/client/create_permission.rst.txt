  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.create_permission(
        name='string',
        resourceType='string',
        policyTemplate='string',
        clientToken='string',
        tags=[
            {
                'key': 'string',
                'value': 'string'
            },
        ]
    )
    
  :type name: string
  :param name: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies the name of the customer managed permission. The name must be unique within the Amazon Web Services Region.

    

  
  :type resourceType: string
  :param resourceType: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies the name of the resource type that this customer managed permission applies to.

     

    The format is ``<service-code>:<resource-type>`` and is case sensitive. For example, to specify an Amazon EC2 Subnet, you can use the string ``ec2:Subnet``. To see the list of valid values for this parameter, query the  ListResourceTypes operation. This value must match the display name of the resource (available in ``ListResourceTypes``).

    

  
  :type policyTemplate: string
  :param policyTemplate: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A string in JSON format string that contains the following elements of a resource-based policy:

     

    
    * **Effect**: must be set to ``ALLOW``.
     
    * **Action**: specifies the actions that are allowed by this customer managed permission. The list must contain only actions that are supported by the specified resource type. For a list of all actions supported by each resource type, see `Actions, resources, and condition keys for Amazon Web Services services <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/reference_policies_actions-resources-contextkeys.html>`__ in the *Identity and Access Management User Guide*.
     
    * **Condition**: (optional) specifies conditional parameters that must evaluate to true when a user attempts an action for that action to be allowed. For more information about the Condition element, see `IAM policies\: Condition element <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_condition.html>`__ in the *Identity and Access Management User Guide*.
    

     

    This template can't include either the ``Resource`` or ``Principal`` elements. Those are both filled in by RAM when it instantiates the resource-based policy on each resource shared using this managed permission. The ``Resource`` comes from the ARN of the specific resource that you are sharing. The ``Principal`` comes from the list of identities added to the resource share.

    

  
  :type clientToken: string
  :param clientToken: 

    Specifies a unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency of the request. This lets you safely retry the request without accidentally performing the same operation a second time. Passing the same value to a later call to an operation requires that you also pass the same value for all other parameters. We recommend that you use a `UUID type of value. <https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier>`__.

     

    If you don't provide this value, then Amazon Web Services generates a random one for you.

     

    If you retry the operation with the same ``ClientToken``, but with different parameters, the retry fails with an ``IdempotentParameterMismatch`` error.

    

  
  :type tags: list
  :param tags: 

    Specifies a list of one or more tag key and value pairs to attach to the permission.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      A structure containing a tag. A tag is metadata that you can attach to your resources to help organize and categorize them. You can also use them to help you secure your resources. For more information, see `Controlling access to Amazon Web Services resources using tags <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_tags.html>`__.

       

      For more information about tags, see `Tagging Amazon Web Services resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference Guide*.

      

    
      - **key** *(string) --* 

        The key, or name, attached to the tag. Every tag must have a key. Key names are case sensitive.

        

      
      - **value** *(string) --* 

        The string value attached to the tag. The value can be an empty string. Key values are case sensitive.

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **permission** *(dict) --* 

        A structure with information about this customer managed permission.

        
        

        - **arn** *(string) --* 

          The `Amazon Resource Name (ARN) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html>`__ of the permission you want information about.

          
        

        - **version** *(string) --* 

          The version of the permission associated with this resource share.

          
        

        - **defaultVersion** *(boolean) --* 

          Specifies whether the version of the managed permission used by this resource share is the default version for this managed permission.

          
        

        - **name** *(string) --* 

          The name of this managed permission.

          
        

        - **resourceType** *(string) --* 

          The type of resource to which this permission applies. This takes the form of: ``service-code``: ``resource-code``, and is case-insensitive. For example, an Amazon EC2 Subnet would be represented by the string ``ec2:subnet``.

          
        

        - **status** *(string) --* 

          The current status of the permission.

          
        

        - **creationTime** *(datetime) --* 

          The date and time when the permission was created.

          
        

        - **lastUpdatedTime** *(datetime) --* 

          The date and time when the permission was last updated.

          
        

        - **isResourceTypeDefault** *(boolean) --* 

          Specifies whether the managed permission associated with this resource share is the default managed permission for all resources of this resource type.

          
        

        - **permissionType** *(string) --* 

          The type of managed permission. This can be one of the following values:

           

          
          * ``AWS_MANAGED`` – Amazon Web Services created and manages this managed permission. You can associate it with your resource shares, but you can't modify it.
           
          * ``CUSTOMER_MANAGED`` – You, or another principal in your account created this managed permission. You can associate it with your resource shares and create new versions that have different permissions.
          

          
        

        - **featureSet** *(string) --* 

          Indicates what features are available for this resource share. This parameter can have one of the following values:

           

          
          * **STANDARD** – A resource share that supports all functionality. These resource shares are visible to all principals you share the resource share with. You can modify these resource shares in RAM using the console or APIs. This resource share might have been created by RAM, or it might have been **CREATED_FROM_POLICY** and then promoted.
           
          * **CREATED_FROM_POLICY** – The customer manually shared a resource by attaching a resource-based policy. That policy did not match any existing managed permissions, so RAM created this customer managed permission automatically on the customer's behalf based on the attached policy document. This type of resource share is visible only to the Amazon Web Services account that created it. You can't modify it in RAM unless you promote it. For more information, see  PromoteResourceShareCreatedFromPolicy.
           
          * **PROMOTING_TO_STANDARD** – This resource share was originally ``CREATED_FROM_POLICY``, but the customer ran the  PromoteResourceShareCreatedFromPolicy and that operation is still in progress. This value changes to ``STANDARD`` when complete.
          

          
        

        - **tags** *(list) --* 

          A list of the tag key value pairs currently attached to the permission.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            A structure containing a tag. A tag is metadata that you can attach to your resources to help organize and categorize them. You can also use them to help you secure your resources. For more information, see `Controlling access to Amazon Web Services resources using tags <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_tags.html>`__.

             

            For more information about tags, see `Tagging Amazon Web Services resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference Guide*.

            
            

            - **key** *(string) --* 

              The key, or name, attached to the tag. Every tag must have a key. Key names are case sensitive.

              
            

            - **value** *(string) --* 

              The string value attached to the tag. The value can be an empty string. Key values are case sensitive.

              
        
      
    
      

      - **clientToken** *(string) --* 

        The idempotency identifier associated with this request. If you want to repeat the same operation in an idempotent manner then you must include this value in the ``clientToken`` request parameter of that later call. All other parameters must also have the same values that you used in the first call.
