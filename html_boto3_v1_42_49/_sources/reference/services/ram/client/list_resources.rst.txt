.. py:method:: RAM.Client.list_resources(**kwargs)

  

  Lists the resources that you added to a resource share or the resources that are shared with you.

   

  .. note::

    

    Always check the ``NextToken`` response parameter for a ``null`` value when calling a paginated operation. These operations can occasionally return an empty set of results even when there are more results available. The ``NextToken`` response parameter value is ``null`` *only* when there are no more results to display.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_resources(
        resourceOwner='SELF'|'OTHER-ACCOUNTS',
        principal='string',
        resourceType='string',
        resourceArns=[
            'string',
        ],
        resourceShareArns=[
            'string',
        ],
        nextToken='string',
        maxResults=123,
        resourceRegionScope='ALL'|'REGIONAL'|'GLOBAL'
    )
    
  :type resourceOwner: string
  :param resourceOwner: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies that you want to list only the resource shares that match the following:

     

    
    * ``SELF`` – resources that your account shares with other accounts
     
    * ``OTHER-ACCOUNTS`` – resources that other accounts share with your account
    

    

  
  :type principal: string
  :param principal: 

    Specifies that you want to list only the resource shares that are associated with the specified principal.

    

  
  :type resourceType: string
  :param resourceType: 

    Specifies that you want to list only the resource shares that include resources of the specified resource type.

     

    For valid values, query the  ListResourceTypes operation.

    

  
  :type resourceArns: list
  :param resourceArns: 

    Specifies that you want to list only the resource shares that include resources with the specified `Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html>`__.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type resourceShareArns: list
  :param resourceShareArns: 

    Specifies that you want to list only resources in the resource shares identified by the specified `Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html>`__.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type nextToken: string
  :param nextToken: 

    Specifies that you want to receive the next page of results. Valid only if you received a ``NextToken`` response in the previous request. If you did, it indicates that more output is available. Set this parameter to the value provided by the previous call's ``NextToken`` response to request the next page of results.

    

  
  :type maxResults: integer
  :param maxResults: 

    Specifies the total number of results that you want included on each page of the response. If you do not include this parameter, it defaults to a value that is specific to the operation. If additional items exist beyond the number you specify, the ``NextToken`` response element is returned with a value (not null). Include the specified value as the ``NextToken`` request parameter in the next call to the operation to get the next part of the results. Note that the service might return fewer results than the maximum even when there are more results available. You should check ``NextToken`` after every operation to ensure that you receive all of the results.

    

  
  :type resourceRegionScope: string
  :param resourceRegionScope: 

    Specifies that you want the results to include only resources that have the specified scope.

     

    
    * ``ALL`` – the results include both global and regional resources or resource types.
     
    * ``GLOBAL`` – the results include only global resources or resource types.
     
    * ``REGIONAL`` – the results include only regional resources or resource types.
    

     

    The default value is ``ALL``.

            The `Amazon Resource Name (ARN) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html>`__ of the resource.

            
          

          - **type** *(string) --* 

            The resource type. This takes the form of: ``service-code``: ``resource-code``, and is case-insensitive. For example, an Amazon EC2 Subnet would be represented by the string ``ec2:subnet``.

            
          

          - **resourceShareArn** *(string) --* 

            The `Amazon Resource Name (ARN) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html>`__ of the resource share this resource is associated with.

            
          

          - **resourceGroupArn** *(string) --* 

            The `Amazon Resource Name (ARN) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html>`__ of the resource group. This value is available only if the resource is part of a resource group.

          - **creationTime** *(datetime) --*

          - **lastUpdatedTime** *(datetime) --* 

            The date an time when the association between the resource and the resource share was last updated.

            
          

          - **resourceRegionScope** *(string) --* 

            Specifies the scope of visibility of this resource:

Use this value in the ``NextToken`` request parameter in a subsequent call to the operation to get the next part of the output. You should repeat this until the ``NextToken`` response element comes back as ``null``. This indicates that this is the last page of results.
