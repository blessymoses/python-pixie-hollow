.. py:method:: RAM.Client.get_resource_share_associations(**kwargs)

  

  Retrieves the lists of resources and principals that associated for resource shares that you own.

   

  .. note::

    

    Always check the ``NextToken`` response parameter for a ``null`` value when calling a paginated operation. These operations can occasionally return an empty set of results even when there are more results available. The ``NextToken`` response parameter value is ``null`` *only* when there are no more results to display.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.get_resource_share_associations(
        associationType='PRINCIPAL'|'RESOURCE'|'SOURCE',
        resourceShareArns=[
            'string',
        ],
        resourceArn='string',
        principal='string',
        associationStatus='ASSOCIATING'|'ASSOCIATED'|'FAILED'|'DISASSOCIATING'|'DISASSOCIATED'|'SUSPENDED'|'SUSPENDING'|'RESTORING',
        nextToken='string',
        maxResults=123
    )
    
  :type associationType: string
  :param associationType: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies whether you want to retrieve the associations that involve a specified resource or principal.

     

    
    * ``PRINCIPAL`` – list the principals whose associations you want to see.
     
    * ``RESOURCE`` – list the resources whose associations you want to see.
    

    

  
  :type resourceShareArns: list
  :param resourceShareArns: 

    Specifies a list of `Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html>`__ of the resource share whose associations you want to retrieve.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type resourceArn: string
  :param resourceArn: 

    Specifies the `Amazon Resource Name (ARN) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html>`__ of a resource whose resource shares you want to retrieve.

     

    You cannot specify this parameter if the association type is ``PRINCIPAL``.

    

  
  :type principal: string
  :param principal: 

    Specifies the ID of the principal whose resource shares you want to retrieve. This can be an Amazon Web Services account ID, an organization ID, an organizational unit ID, or the `Amazon Resource Name (ARN) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html>`__ of an individual IAM role or user.

     

    You cannot specify this parameter if the association type is ``RESOURCE``.

    

  
  :type associationStatus: string
  :param associationStatus: 

    Specifies that you want to retrieve only associations that have this status.

    

  
  :type nextToken: string
  :param nextToken: 

    Specifies that you want to receive the next page of results. Valid only if you received a ``NextToken`` response in the previous request. If you did, it indicates that more output is available. Set this parameter to the value provided by the previous call's ``NextToken`` response to request the next page of results.

    

  
  :type maxResults: integer
  :param maxResults: 

    Specifies the total number of results that you want included on each page of the response. If you do not include this parameter, it defaults to a value that is specific to the operation. If additional items exist beyond the number you specify, the ``NextToken`` response element is returned with a value (not null). Include the specified value as the ``NextToken`` request parameter in the next call to the operation to get the next part of the results. Note that the service might return fewer results than the maximum even when there are more results available. You should check ``NextToken`` after every operation to ensure that you receive all of the results.
