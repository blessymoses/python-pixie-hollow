.. py:method:: RAM.Client.promote_permission_created_from_policy(**kwargs)

  

  When you attach a resource-based policy to a resource, RAM automatically creates a resource share of ``featureSet``= ``CREATED_FROM_POLICY`` with a managed permission that has the same IAM permissions as the original resource-based policy. However, this type of managed permission is visible to only the resource share owner, and the associated resource share can't be modified by using RAM.

   

  This operation creates a separate, fully manageable customer managed permission that has the same IAM permissions as the original resource-based policy. You can associate this customer managed permission to any resource shares.

   

  Before you use  PromoteResourceShareCreatedFromPolicy, you should first run this operation to ensure that you have an appropriate customer managed permission that can be associated with the promoted resource share.

   

  .. note::

    

    
    * The original ``CREATED_FROM_POLICY`` policy isn't deleted, and resource shares using that original policy aren't automatically updated.
     
    * You can't modify a ``CREATED_FROM_POLICY`` resource share so you can't associate the new customer managed permission by using ``ReplacePermsissionAssociations``. However, if you use  PromoteResourceShareCreatedFromPolicy, that operation automatically associates the fully manageable customer managed permission to the newly promoted ``STANDARD`` resource share.
     
    * After you promote a resource share, if the original ``CREATED_FROM_POLICY`` managed permission has no other associations to A resource share, then RAM automatically deletes it.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.promote_permission_created_from_policy(
        permissionArn='string',
        name='string',
        clientToken='string'
    )
    
  :type permissionArn: string
  :param permissionArn: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies the `Amazon Resource Name (ARN) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html>`__ of the ``CREATED_FROM_POLICY`` permission that you want to promote. You can get this `Amazon Resource Name (ARN) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html>`__ by calling the  ListResourceSharePermissions operation.

    

  
  :type name: string
  :param name: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies a name for the promoted customer managed permission.

    

  
  :type clientToken: string
  :param clientToken: 

    Specifies a unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency of the request. This lets you safely retry the request without accidentally performing the same operation a second time. Passing the same value to a later call to an operation requires that you also pass the same value for all other parameters. We recommend that you use a `UUID type of value. <https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier>`__.

     

    If you don't provide this value, then Amazon Web Services generates a random one for you.

     

    If you retry the operation with the same ``ClientToken``, but with different parameters, the retry fails with an ``IdempotentParameterMismatch`` error.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **permission** *(dict) --* 

        Information about an RAM permission.

        
        

        - **arn** *(string) --* 

          The `Amazon Resource Name (ARN) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html>`__ of the permission you want information about.

          
        

        - **version** *(string) --* 

          The version of the permission associated with this resource share.

          
        

        - **defaultVersion** *(boolean) --* 

          Specifies whether the version of the managed permission used by this resource share is the default version for this managed permission.

          
        

        - **name** *(string) --* 

          The name of this managed permission.

          
        

        - **resourceType** *(string) --* 

          The type of resource to which this permission applies. This takes the form of: ``service-code``: ``resource-code``, and is case-insensitive. For example, an Amazon EC2 Subnet would be represented by the string ``ec2:subnet``.

          
        

        - **status** *(string) --* 

          The current status of the permission.

          
        

        - **creationTime** *(datetime) --* 

          The date and time when the permission was created.

          
        

        - **lastUpdatedTime** *(datetime) --*

        - **isResourceTypeDefault** *(boolean) --* 

          Specifies whether the managed permission associated with this resource share is the default managed permission for all resources of this resource type.

          
        

        - **permissionType** *(string) --* 

          The type of managed permission. This can be one of the following values:

           

          
          * ``AWS_MANAGED`` – Amazon Web Services created and manages this managed permission. You can associate it with your resource shares, but you can't modify it.
           
          * ``CUSTOMER_MANAGED`` – You, or another principal in your account created this managed permission. You can associate it with your resource shares and create new versions that have different permissions.
          

          
        

        - **featureSet** *(string) --* 

          Indicates what features are available for this resource share. This parameter can have one of the following values:

           

          
          * **STANDARD** – A resource share that supports all functionality. These resource shares are visible to all principals you share the resource share with. You can modify these resource shares in RAM using the console or APIs. This resource share might have been created by RAM, or it might have been **CREATED_FROM_POLICY** and then promoted.
           
          * **CREATED_FROM_POLICY** – The customer manually shared a resource by attaching a resource-based policy. That policy did not match any existing managed permissions, so RAM created this customer managed permission automatically on the customer's behalf based on the attached policy document. This type of resource share is visible only to the Amazon Web Services account that created it. You can't modify it in RAM unless you promote it. For more information, see  PromoteResourceShareCreatedFromPolicy.
           
          * **PROMOTING_TO_STANDARD** – This resource share was originally ``CREATED_FROM_POLICY``, but the customer ran the  PromoteResourceShareCreatedFromPolicy and that operation is still in progress. This value changes to ``STANDARD`` when complete.
          

          
        

        - **tags** *(list) --* 

          A list of the tag key value pairs currently attached to the permission.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            A structure containing a tag. A tag is metadata that you can attach to your resources to help organize and categorize them. You can also use them to help you secure your resources. For more information, see `Controlling access to Amazon Web Services resources using tags <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_tags.html>`__.

             

            For more information about tags, see `Tagging Amazon Web Services resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference Guide*.

            
            

            - **key** *(string) --* 

              The key, or name, attached to the tag. Every tag must have a key. Key names are case sensitive.

              
            

            - **value** *(string) --* 

              The string value attached to the tag. The value can be an empty string. Key values are case sensitive.

              
        
      
    
      

      - **clientToken** *(string) --* 

        The idempotency identifier associated with this request. If you want to repeat the same operation in an idempotent manner then you must include this value in the ``clientToken`` request parameter of that later call. All other parameters must also have the same values that you used in the first call.
