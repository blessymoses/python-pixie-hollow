.. py:method:: RAM.Client.list_permission_versions(**kwargs)

  

  Lists the available versions of the specified RAM permission.

   

  .. note::

    

    Always check the ``NextToken`` response parameter for a ``null`` value when calling a paginated operation. These operations can occasionally return an empty set of results even when there are more results available. The ``NextToken`` response parameter value is ``null`` *only* when there are no more results to display.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_permission_versions(
        permissionArn='string',
        nextToken='string',
        maxResults=123
    )
    
  :type permissionArn: string
  :param permissionArn: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies the `Amazon Resource Name (ARN) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html>`__ of the RAM permission whose versions you want to list. You can use the ``permissionVersion`` parameter on the  AssociateResourceSharePermission operation to specify a non-default version to attach.

    

  
  :type nextToken: string
  :param nextToken: 

    Specifies that you want to receive the next page of results. Valid only if you received a ``NextToken`` response in the previous request. If you did, it indicates that more output is available. Set this parameter to the value provided by the previous call's ``NextToken`` response to request the next page of results.

    

  
  :type maxResults: integer
  :param maxResults: 

    Specifies the total number of results that you want included on each page of the response. If you do not include this parameter, it defaults to a value that is specific to the operation. If additional items exist beyond the number you specify, the ``NextToken`` response element is returned with a value (not null). Include the specified value as the ``NextToken`` request parameter in the next call to the operation to get the next part of the results. Note that the service might return fewer results than the maximum even when there are more results available. You should check ``NextToken`` after every operation to ensure that you receive all of the results.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **permissions** *(list) --* 

        An array of objects that contain details for each of the available versions.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          Information about an RAM permission.

          
          

          - **arn** *(string) --* 

            The `Amazon Resource Name (ARN) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html>`__ of the permission you want information about.

            
          

          - **version** *(string) --* 

            The version of the permission associated with this resource share.

            
          

          - **defaultVersion** *(boolean) --* 

            Specifies whether the version of the managed permission used by this resource share is the default version for this managed permission.

            
          

          - **name** *(string) --* 

            The name of this managed permission.

            
          

          - **resourceType** *(string) --* 

            The type of resource to which this permission applies. This takes the form of: ``service-code``: ``resource-code``, and is case-insensitive. For example, an Amazon EC2 Subnet would be represented by the string ``ec2:subnet``.

            
          

          - **status** *(string) --* 

            The current status of the permission.

            
          

          - **creationTime** *(datetime) --* 

            The date and time when the permission was created.

            
          

          - **lastUpdatedTime** *(datetime) --* 

            The date and time when the permission was last updated.

            
          

          - **isResourceTypeDefault** *(boolean) --* 

            Specifies whether the managed permission associated with this resource share is the default managed permission for all resources of this resource type.

            
          

          - **permissionType** *(string) --* 

            The type of managed permission. This can be one of the following values:

             

            
            * ``AWS_MANAGED`` – Amazon Web Services created and manages this managed permission. You can associate it with your resource shares, but you can't modify it.
             
            * ``CUSTOMER_MANAGED`` – You, or another principal in your account created this managed permission. You can associate it with your resource shares and create new versions that have different permissions.
            

            
          

          - **featureSet** *(string) --* 

            Indicates what features are available for this resource share. This parameter can have one of the following values:

             

            
            * **STANDARD** – A resource share that supports all functionality. These resource shares are visible to all principals you share the resource share with. You can modify these resource shares in RAM using the console or APIs. This resource share might have been created by RAM, or it might have been **CREATED_FROM_POLICY** and then promoted.
             
            * **CREATED_FROM_POLICY** – The customer manually shared a resource by attaching a resource-based policy. That policy did not match any existing managed permissions, so RAM created this customer managed permission automatically on the customer's behalf based on the attached policy document. This type of resource share is visible only to the Amazon Web Services account that created it. You can't modify it in RAM unless you promote it. For more information, see  PromoteResourceShareCreatedFromPolicy.
             
            * **PROMOTING_TO_STANDARD** – This resource share was originally ``CREATED_FROM_POLICY``, but the customer ran the  PromoteResourceShareCreatedFromPolicy and that operation is still in progress. This value changes to ``STANDARD`` when complete.
            

            
          

          - **tags** *(list) --* 

            A list of the tag key value pairs currently attached to the permission.

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

              A structure containing a tag. A tag is metadata that you can attach to your resources to help organize and categorize them. You can also use them to help you secure your resources. For more information, see `Controlling access to Amazon Web Services resources using tags <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_tags.html>`__.

               

              For more information about tags, see `Tagging Amazon Web Services resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference Guide*.

              
              

              - **key** *(string) --* 

                The key, or name, attached to the tag. Every tag must have a key. Key names are case sensitive.

                
              

              - **value** *(string) --* 

                The string value attached to the tag. The value can be an empty string. Key values are case sensitive.

                
          
        
      
    
      

      - **nextToken** *(string) --* 

        If present, this value indicates that more output is available than is included in the current response. Use this value in the ``NextToken`` request parameter in a subsequent call to the operation to get the next part of the output. You should repeat this until the ``NextToken`` response element comes back as ``null``. This indicates that this is the last page of results.
