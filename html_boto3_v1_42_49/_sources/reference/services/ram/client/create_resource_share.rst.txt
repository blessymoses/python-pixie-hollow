.. py:method:: RAM.Client.create_resource_share(**kwargs)

  

  Creates a resource share. You can provide a list of the `Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html>`__ for the resources that you want to share, a list of principals you want to share the resources with, the permissions to grant those principals, and optionally source constraints to enhance security for service principal sharing.

   

  .. note::

    

    Sharing a resource makes it available for use by principals outside of the Amazon Web Services account that created the resource. Sharing doesn't change any permissions or quotas that apply to the resource in the account that created it.

        ]
    )
    
  :type name: string
  :param name: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies the name of the resource share.

    

  
  :type resourceArns: list
  :param resourceArns: 

    Specifies a list of one or more ARNs of the resources to associate with the resource share.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type principals: list
  :param principals: 

    Specifies a list of one or more principals to associate with the resource share.

     

    You can include the following values:

     

    
    * An Amazon Web Services account ID, for example: ``123456789012``
     
    * An `Amazon Resource Name (ARN) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html>`__ of an organization in Organizations, for example: ``organizations::123456789012:organization/o-exampleorgid``
     
    * An ARN of an organizational unit (OU) in Organizations, for example: ``organizations::123456789012:ou/o-exampleorgid/ou-examplerootid-exampleouid123``
     
    * An ARN of an IAM role, for example: ``iam::123456789012:role/rolename``
     
    * An ARN of an IAM user, for example: ``iam::123456789012user/username``
     
    * A service principal name, for example: ``service-id.amazonaws.com``
    

     

    .. note::

      

      Not all resource types can be shared with IAM roles and users. For more information, see `Sharing with IAM roles and users <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/permissions.html#permissions-rbp-supported-resource-types>`__ in the *Resource Access Manager User Guide*.

      

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type tags: list
  :param tags: 

    Specifies one or more tags to attach to the resource share itself. It doesn't attach the tags to the resources associated with the resource share.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      A structure containing a tag. A tag is metadata that you can attach to your resources to help organize and categorize them. You can also use them to help you secure your resources. For more information, see `Controlling access to Amazon Web Services resources using tags <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_tags.html>`__.

       

      For more information about tags, see `Tagging Amazon Web Services resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference Guide*.

      

    
      - **key** *(string) --* 

        The key, or name, attached to the tag. Every tag must have a key. Key names are case sensitive.

        

      
      - **value** *(string) --* 

        The string value attached to the tag. The value can be an empty string. Key values are case sensitive.

        

      
    

  :type allowExternalPrincipals: boolean
  :param allowExternalPrincipals: 

    Specifies whether principals outside your organization in Organizations can be associated with a resource share. A value of ``true`` lets you share with individual Amazon Web Services accounts that are *not* in your organization. A value of ``false`` only has meaning if your account is a member of an Amazon Web Services Organization. The default value is ``true``.

    

  
  :type clientToken: string
  :param clientToken: 

    Specifies a unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency of the request. This lets you safely retry the request without accidentally performing the same operation a second time. Passing the same value to a later call to an operation requires that you also pass the same value for all other parameters. We recommend that you use a `UUID type of value. <https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier>`__.

     

    If you don't provide this value, then Amazon Web Services generates a random one for you.

     

    If you retry the operation with the same ``ClientToken``, but with different parameters, the retry fails with an ``IdempotentParameterMismatch`` error.

    

  
  :type permissionArns: list
  :param permissionArns: 

    Specifies the `Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html>`__ of the RAM permission to associate with the resource share. If you do not specify an ARN for the permission, RAM automatically attaches the default version of the permission for each resource type. You can associate only one permission with each resource type included in the resource share.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type sources: list
  :param sources: 

    Specifies source constraints (accounts, ARNs, organization IDs, or organization paths) that limit when service principals can access resources in this resource share. When a service principal attempts to access a shared resource, validation is performed to ensure the request originates from one of the specified sources. This helps prevent confused deputy attacks by applying constraints on where service principals can access resources from.

            - **key** *(string) --* 

              The key, or name, attached to the tag. Every tag must have a key. Key names are case sensitive.

        - **featureSet** *(string) --* 

          Indicates what features are available for this resource share. This parameter can have one of the following values:

           

          
          * **STANDARD** – A resource share that supports all functionality. These resource shares are visible to all principals you share the resource share with. You can modify these resource shares in RAM using the console or APIs. This resource share might have been created by RAM, or it might have been **CREATED_FROM_POLICY** and then promoted.
           
          * **CREATED_FROM_POLICY** – The customer manually shared a resource by attaching a resource-based policy. That policy did not match any existing managed permissions, so RAM created this customer managed permission automatically on the customer's behalf based on the attached policy document. This type of resource share is visible only to the Amazon Web Services account that created it. You can't modify it in RAM unless you promote it. For more information, see  PromoteResourceShareCreatedFromPolicy.
           
          * **PROMOTING_TO_STANDARD** – This resource share was originally ``CREATED_FROM_POLICY``, but the customer ran the  PromoteResourceShareCreatedFromPolicy and that operation is still in progress. This value changes to ``STANDARD`` when complete.
          

          
    
      

      - **clientToken** *(string) --* 

        The idempotency identifier associated with this request. If you want to repeat the same operation in an idempotent manner then you must include this value in the ``clientToken`` request parameter of that later call. All other parameters must also have the same values that you used in the first call.
