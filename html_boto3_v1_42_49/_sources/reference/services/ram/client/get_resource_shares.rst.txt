.. py:method:: RAM.Client.get_resource_shares(**kwargs)

  

  Retrieves details about the resource shares that you own or that are shared with you.

   

  .. note::

    

    Always check the ``NextToken`` response parameter for a ``null`` value when calling a paginated operation. These operations can occasionally return an empty set of results even when there are more results available. The ``NextToken`` response parameter value is ``null`` *only* when there are no more results to display.

    )
    
  :type resourceShareArns: list
  :param resourceShareArns: 

    Specifies the `Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html>`__ of individual resource shares that you want information about.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type resourceShareStatus: string
  :param resourceShareStatus: 

    Specifies that you want to retrieve details of only those resource shares that have this status.

    

  
  :type resourceOwner: string
  :param resourceOwner: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies that you want to retrieve details of only those resource shares that match the following:

     

    
    * ``SELF`` – resource shares that your account shares with other accounts
     
    * ``OTHER-ACCOUNTS`` – resource shares that other accounts share with your account
    

    

  
  :type name: string
  :param name: 

    Specifies the name of an individual resource share that you want to retrieve details about.

    

  
  :type tagFilters: list
  :param tagFilters: 

    Specifies that you want to retrieve details of only those resource shares that match the specified tag keys and values.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      A tag key and optional list of possible values that you can use to filter results for tagged resources.

       

      .. note::

        

        Multiple tag filters are evaluated as an OR condition.

        

      

    
      - **tagKey** *(string) --* 

        The tag key. This must have a valid string value and can't be empty.

        

      
      - **tagValues** *(list) --* 

        A list of zero or more tag values. If no values are provided, then the filter matches any tag with the specified key, regardless of its value.

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
    
    

  :type nextToken: string
  :param nextToken: 

    Specifies that you want to receive the next page of results. Valid only if you received a ``NextToken`` response in the previous request. If you did, it indicates that more output is available. Set this parameter to the value provided by the previous call's ``NextToken`` response to request the next page of results.

    

  
  :type maxResults: integer
  :param maxResults: 

    Specifies the total number of results that you want included on each page of the response. If you do not include this parameter, it defaults to a value that is specific to the operation. If additional items exist beyond the number you specify, the ``NextToken`` response element is returned with a value (not null). Include the specified value as the ``NextToken`` request parameter in the next call to the operation to get the next part of the results. Note that the service might return fewer results than the maximum even when there are more results available. You should check ``NextToken`` after every operation to ensure that you receive all of the results.

    

  
  :type permissionArn: string
  :param permissionArn: 

    Specifies that you want to retrieve details of only those resource shares that use the managed permission with this `Amazon Resource Name (ARN) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html>`__.

    

  
  :type permissionVersion: integer
  :param permissionVersion:

        - *(dict) --* 

          Describes a resource share in RAM.

          
          

          - **resourceShareArn** *(string) --* 

            The `Amazon Resource Name (ARN) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html>`__ of the resource share

            
          

          - **name** *(string) --* 

            The name of the resource share.

            * ``True`` – the resource share can be shared with any Amazon Web Services account.
             
            * ``False`` – the resource share can be shared with only accounts in the same organization as the account that owns the resource share.
            

            
          

          - **status** *(string) --* 

            The current status of the resource share.

            
          

          - **statusMessage** *(string) --* 

            A message about the status of the resource share.

            
          

          - **tags** *(list) --*

            - *(dict) --* 

              A structure containing a tag. A tag is metadata that you can attach to your resources to help organize and categorize them. You can also use them to help you secure your resources. For more information, see `Controlling access to Amazon Web Services resources using tags <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_tags.html>`__.

               

              For more information about tags, see `Tagging Amazon Web Services resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference Guide*.

              
              

              - **key** *(string) --* 

                The key, or name, attached to the tag. Every tag must have a key. Key names are case sensitive.

          - **creationTime** *(datetime) --*

          - **lastUpdatedTime** *(datetime) --* 

            The date and time when the resource share was last updated.

            
          

          - **featureSet** *(string) --* 

            Indicates what features are available for this resource share. This parameter can have one of the following values:

             

            
            * **STANDARD** – A resource share that supports all functionality. These resource shares are visible to all principals you share the resource share with. You can modify these resource shares in RAM using the console or APIs. This resource share might have been created by RAM, or it might have been **CREATED_FROM_POLICY** and then promoted.
             
            * **CREATED_FROM_POLICY** – The customer manually shared a resource by attaching a resource-based policy. That policy did not match any existing managed permissions, so RAM created this customer managed permission automatically on the customer's behalf based on the attached policy document. This type of resource share is visible only to the Amazon Web Services account that created it. You can't modify it in RAM unless you promote it. For more information, see  PromoteResourceShareCreatedFromPolicy.
             
            * **PROMOTING_TO_STANDARD** – This resource share was originally ``CREATED_FROM_POLICY``, but the customer ran the  PromoteResourceShareCreatedFromPolicy and that operation is still in progress. This value changes to ``STANDARD`` when complete.
            

            
      
    
      

      - **nextToken** *(string) --* 

        If present, this value indicates that more output is available than is included in the current response. Use this value in the ``NextToken`` request parameter in a subsequent call to the operation to get the next part of the output. You should repeat this until the ``NextToken`` response element comes back as ``null``. This indicates that this is the last page of results.
