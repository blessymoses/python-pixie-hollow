  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_resource_types(
        nextToken='string',
        maxResults=123,
        resourceRegionScope='ALL'|'REGIONAL'|'GLOBAL'
    )
    
  :type nextToken: string
  :param nextToken: 

    Specifies that you want to receive the next page of results. Valid only if you received a ``NextToken`` response in the previous request. If you did, it indicates that more output is available. Set this parameter to the value provided by the previous call's ``NextToken`` response to request the next page of results.

    

  
  :type maxResults: integer
  :param maxResults: 

    Specifies the total number of results that you want included on each page of the response. If you do not include this parameter, it defaults to a value that is specific to the operation. If additional items exist beyond the number you specify, the ``NextToken`` response element is returned with a value (not null). Include the specified value as the ``NextToken`` request parameter in the next call to the operation to get the next part of the results. Note that the service might return fewer results than the maximum even when there are more results available. You should check ``NextToken`` after every operation to ensure that you receive all of the results.

    

  
  :type resourceRegionScope: string
  :param resourceRegionScope: 

    Specifies that you want the results to include only resources that have the specified scope.

     

    
    * ``ALL`` – the results include both global and regional resources or resource types.
     
    * ``GLOBAL`` – the results include only global resources or resource types.
     
    * ``REGIONAL`` – the results include only regional resources or resource types.
    

     

    The default value is ``ALL``.

    ::

      {
          'resourceTypes': [
              {
                  'resourceType': 'string',

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **resourceTypes** *(list) --* 

        An array of objects that contain information about the resource types that can be shared using RAM.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          Information about a shareable resource type and the Amazon Web Services service to which resources of that type belong.

          
          

          - **resourceType** *(string) --* 

            The type of the resource. This takes the form of: ``service-code``: ``resource-code``, and is case-insensitive. For example, an Amazon EC2 Subnet would be represented by the string ``ec2:subnet``.

            
          

          - **serviceName** *(string) --* 

            The name of the Amazon Web Services service to which resources of this type belong.

            
          

          - **resourceRegionScope** *(string) --* 

            Specifies the scope of visibility of resources of this type:

             

            
            * **REGIONAL** – The resource can be accessed only by using requests that target the Amazon Web Services Region in which the resource exists.
             
            * **GLOBAL** – The resource can be accessed from any Amazon Web Services Region.
            

            
      
    
      

      - **nextToken** *(string) --* 

        If present, this value indicates that more output is available than is included in the current response. Use this value in the ``NextToken`` request parameter in a subsequent call to the operation to get the next part of the output. You should repeat this until the ``NextToken`` response element comes back as ``null``. This indicates that this is the last page of results.
