  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.get_permission(
        permissionArn='string',
        permissionVersion=123
    )
    
  :type permissionArn: string
  :param permissionArn: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies the `Amazon Resource Name (ARN) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html>`__ of the permission whose contents you want to retrieve. To find the ARN for a permission, use either the  ListPermissions operation or go to the `Permissions library <https://console.aws.amazon.com/ram/home#Permissions:>`__ page in the RAM console and then choose the name of the permission. The ARN is displayed on the detail page.

    

  
  :type permissionVersion: integer
  :param permissionVersion: 

    Specifies the version number of the RAM permission to retrieve. If you don't specify this parameter, the operation retrieves the default version.

     

    To see the list of available versions, use  ListPermissionVersions.

        - **arn** *(string) --* 

          The `Amazon Resource Name (ARN) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html>`__ of this RAM managed permission.

          
        

        - **version** *(string) --* 

          The version of the permission described in this response.

          
        

        - **defaultVersion** *(boolean) --* 

          Specifies whether the version of the permission represented in this response is the default version for this permission.

          
        

        - **name** *(string) --* 

          The name of this permission.

          
        

        - **resourceType** *(string) --* 

          The resource type to which this permission applies.

          
        

        - **permission** *(string) --* 

          The permission's effect and actions in JSON format. The ``effect`` indicates whether the specified actions are allowed or denied. The ``actions`` list the operations to which the principal is granted or denied access.

          
        

        - **creationTime** *(datetime) --* 

          The date and time when the permission was created.

          
        

        - **lastUpdatedTime** *(datetime) --* 

          The date and time when the permission was last updated.

          
        

        - **isResourceTypeDefault** *(boolean) --* 

          Specifies whether the version of the permission represented in this response is the default version for all resources of this resource type.

          
        

        - **permissionType** *(string) --* 

          The type of managed permission. This can be one of the following values:

           

          
          * ``AWS_MANAGED`` – Amazon Web Services created and manages this managed permission. You can associate it with your resource shares, but you can't modify it.
           
          * ``CUSTOMER_MANAGED`` – You, or another principal in your account created this managed permission. You can associate it with your resource shares and create new versions that have different permissions.
          

          
        

        - **featureSet** *(string) --* 

          Indicates what features are available for this resource share. This parameter can have one of the following values:

           

          
          * **STANDARD** – A resource share that supports all functionality. These resource shares are visible to all principals you share the resource share with. You can modify these resource shares in RAM using the console or APIs. This resource share might have been created by RAM, or it might have been **CREATED_FROM_POLICY** and then promoted.
           
          * **CREATED_FROM_POLICY** – The customer manually shared a resource by attaching a resource-based policy. That policy did not match any existing managed permissions, so RAM created this customer managed permission automatically on the customer's behalf based on the attached policy document. This type of resource share is visible only to the Amazon Web Services account that created it. You can't modify it in RAM unless you promote it. For more information, see  PromoteResourceShareCreatedFromPolicy.
           
          * **PROMOTING_TO_STANDARD** – This resource share was originally ``CREATED_FROM_POLICY``, but the customer ran the  PromoteResourceShareCreatedFromPolicy and that operation is still in progress. This value changes to ``STANDARD`` when complete.
          

          
        

        - **status** *(string) --* 

          The current status of the association between the permission and the resource share. The following are the possible values:

           

          
          * ``ATTACHABLE`` – This permission or version can be associated with resource shares.
           
          * ``UNATTACHABLE`` – This permission or version can't currently be associated with resource shares.
           
          * ``DELETING`` – This permission or version is in the process of being deleted.
           
          * ``DELETED`` – This permission or version is deleted.
          

          
        

        - **tags** *(list) --* 

          The tag key and value pairs attached to the resource share.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            A structure containing a tag. A tag is metadata that you can attach to your resources to help organize and categorize them. You can also use them to help you secure your resources. For more information, see `Controlling access to Amazon Web Services resources using tags <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_tags.html>`__.

             

            For more information about tags, see `Tagging Amazon Web Services resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference Guide*.

            
            

            - **key** *(string) --* 

              The key, or name, attached to the tag. Every tag must have a key. Key names are case sensitive.

              
            

            - **value** *(string) --* 

              The string value attached to the tag. The value can be an empty string. Key values are case sensitive.
