.. py:method:: S3Control.Client.create_access_point(**kwargs)

  

  Creates an access point and associates it to a specified bucket. For more information, see `Managing access to shared datasets with access points <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-points.html>`__ or `Managing access to shared datasets in directory buckets with access points <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-points-directory-buckets.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

   

  To create an access point and attach it to a volume on an Amazon FSx file system, see `CreateAndAttachS3AccessPoint <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/APIReference/API_CreateAndAttachS3AccessPoint.html>`__ in the *Amazon FSx API Reference*.

   

  

   

  .. note::

    

    S3 on Outposts only supports VPC-style access points.

     

    For more information, see `Accessing Amazon S3 on Outposts using virtual private cloud (VPC) only access points <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

    

   

  All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an additional parameter of ``x-amz-outpost-id`` to be passed with the request. In addition, you must use an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of ``s3-control``. For an example of the request syntax for Amazon S3 on Outposts that uses the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix and the ``x-amz-outpost-id`` derived by using the access point ARN, see the `Examples <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_CreateAccessPoint.html#API_control_CreateAccessPoint_Examples>`__ section.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.create_access_point(
        AccountId='string',
        Name='string',
        Bucket='string',
        VpcConfiguration={
            'VpcId': 'string'
        },
        PublicAccessBlockConfiguration={
            'BlockPublicAcls': True|False,
            'IgnorePublicAcls': True|False,
            'BlockPublicPolicy': True|False,
            'RestrictPublicBuckets': True|False
        },
        BucketAccountId='string',
        Scope={
            'Prefixes': [
                'string',
            ],
            'Permissions': [
                'GetObject'|'GetObjectAttributes'|'ListMultipartUploadParts'|'ListBucket'|'ListBucketMultipartUploads'|'PutObject'|'DeleteObject'|'AbortMultipartUpload',
            ]
        },
        Tags=[
            {
                'Key': 'string',
                'Value': 'string'
            },
        ]
    )
    
  :type AccountId: string
  :param AccountId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The Amazon Web Services account ID for the account that owns the specified access point.

    

  
  :type Name: string
  :param Name: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name you want to assign to this access point.

     

    For directory buckets, the access point name must consist of a base name that you provide and suffix that includes the ``ZoneID`` (Amazon Web Services Availability Zone or Local Zone) of your bucket location, followed by ``--xa-s3``. For more information, see `Managing access to shared datasets in directory buckets with access points <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-points-directory-buckets.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

    

  
  :type Bucket: string
  :param Bucket: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of the bucket that you want to associate this access point with.

     

    For using this parameter with Amazon S3 on Outposts with the REST API, you must specify the name and the x-amz-outpost-id as well.

     

    For using this parameter with S3 on Outposts with the Amazon Web Services SDK and CLI, you must specify the ARN of the bucket accessed in the format ``arn:aws:s3-outposts:<Region>:<account-id>:outpost/<outpost-id>/bucket/<my-bucket-name>``. For example, to access the bucket ``reports`` through Outpost ``my-outpost`` owned by account ``123456789012`` in Region ``us-west-2``, use the URL encoding of ``arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/bucket/reports``. The value must be URL encoded.

    

  
  :type VpcConfiguration: dict
  :param VpcConfiguration: 

    If you include this field, Amazon S3 restricts access to this access point to requests from the specified virtual private cloud (VPC).

     

    .. note::

      

      This is required for creating an access point for Amazon S3 on Outposts buckets.

      

    

  
    - **VpcId** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      If this field is specified, this access point will only allow connections from the specified VPC ID.

      

    
  
  :type PublicAccessBlockConfiguration: dict
  :param PublicAccessBlockConfiguration: 

    The ``PublicAccessBlock`` configuration that you want to apply to the access point.

    

  
    - **BlockPublicAcls** *(boolean) --* 

      Specifies whether Amazon S3 should block public access control lists (ACLs) for buckets in this account. Setting this element to ``TRUE`` causes the following behavior:

       

      
      * ``PutBucketAcl`` and ``PutObjectAcl`` calls fail if the specified ACL is public.
       
      * PUT Object calls fail if the request includes a public ACL.
       
      * PUT Bucket calls fail if the request includes a public ACL.
      

       

      Enabling this setting doesn't affect existing policies or ACLs.

       

      This property is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

      

    
    - **IgnorePublicAcls** *(boolean) --* 

      Specifies whether Amazon S3 should ignore public ACLs for buckets in this account. Setting this element to ``TRUE`` causes Amazon S3 to ignore all public ACLs on buckets in this account and any objects that they contain.

       

      Enabling this setting doesn't affect the persistence of any existing ACLs and doesn't prevent new public ACLs from being set.

       

      This property is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

      

    
    - **BlockPublicPolicy** *(boolean) --* 

      Specifies whether Amazon S3 should block public bucket policies for buckets in this account. Setting this element to ``TRUE`` causes Amazon S3 to reject calls to PUT Bucket policy if the specified bucket policy allows public access.

       

      Enabling this setting doesn't affect existing bucket policies.

       

      This property is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

      

    
    - **RestrictPublicBuckets** *(boolean) --* 

      Specifies whether Amazon S3 should restrict public bucket policies for buckets in this account. Setting this element to ``TRUE`` restricts access to buckets with public policies to only Amazon Web Services service principals and authorized users within this account.

       

      Enabling this setting doesn't affect previously stored bucket policies, except that public and cross-account access within any public bucket policy, including non-public delegation to specific accounts, is blocked.

       

      This property is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

      

    
  
  :type BucketAccountId: string
  :param BucketAccountId: 

    The Amazon Web Services account ID associated with the S3 bucket associated with this access point.

     

    For same account access point when your bucket and access point belong to the same account owner, the ``BucketAccountId`` is not required. For cross-account access point when your bucket and access point are not in the same account, the ``BucketAccountId`` is required.

    

  
  :type Scope: dict
  :param Scope: 

    For directory buckets, you can filter access control to specific prefixes, API operations, or a combination of both. For more information, see `Managing access to shared datasets in directory buckets with access points <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-points-directory-buckets.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

     

    .. note::

      

      Scope is only supported for access points attached to directory buckets.

      

    

  
    - **Prefixes** *(list) --* 

      You can specify any amount of prefixes, but the total length of characters of all prefixes must be less than 256 bytes in size.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    - **Permissions** *(list) --* 

      You can include one or more API operations as permissions.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
  
  :type Tags: list
  :param Tags: 

    An array of tags that you can apply to an access point. Tags are key-value pairs of metadata used to control access to your access points. For more information about tags, see `Using tags with Amazon S3 <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/tagging.html>`__. For information about tagging access points, see `Using tags for attribute-based access control (ABAC) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/tagging.html#using-tags-for-abac>`__.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      A key-value pair that you use to label your resources. You can add tags to new resources when you create them, or you can add tags to existing resources. Tags can help you organize, track costs for, and control access to resources.

      

    
      - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The key of the key-value pair of a tag added to your Amazon Web Services resource. A tag key can be up to 128 Unicode characters in length and is case-sensitive. System created tags that begin with ``aws:`` aren’t supported.

        

      
      - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The value of the key-value pair of a tag added to your Amazon Web Services resource. A tag value can be up to 256 Unicode characters in length and is case-sensitive.
