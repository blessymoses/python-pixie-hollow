.. py:method:: S3Control.Client.get_bucket(**kwargs)

  

  Gets an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket. For more information, see `Using Amazon S3 on Outposts <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

   

  If you are using an identity other than the root user of the Amazon Web Services account that owns the Outposts bucket, the calling identity must have the ``s3-outposts:GetBucket`` permissions on the specified Outposts bucket and belong to the Outposts bucket owner's account in order to use this action. Only users from Outposts bucket owner account with the right permissions can perform actions on an Outposts bucket.

   

  If you don't have ``s3-outposts:GetBucket`` permissions or you're not using an identity that belongs to the bucket owner's account, Amazon S3 returns a ``403 Access Denied`` error.

   

  The following actions are related to ``GetBucket`` for Amazon S3 on Outposts:

   

  All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an additional parameter of ``x-amz-outpost-id`` to be passed with the request. In addition, you must use an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of ``s3-control``. For an example of the request syntax for Amazon S3 on Outposts that uses the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix and the ``x-amz-outpost-id`` derived by using the access point ARN, see the `Examples <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_GetBucket.html#API_control_GetBucket_Examples>`__ section.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.get_bucket(
        AccountId='string',
        Bucket='string'
    )
    
  :type AccountId: string
  :param AccountId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The Amazon Web Services account ID of the Outposts bucket.

    

  
  :type Bucket: string
  :param Bucket: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies the bucket.

     

    For using this parameter with Amazon S3 on Outposts with the REST API, you must specify the name and the x-amz-outpost-id as well.

     

    For using this parameter with S3 on Outposts with the Amazon Web Services SDK and CLI, you must specify the ARN of the bucket accessed in the format ``arn:aws:s3-outposts:<Region>:<account-id>:outpost/<outpost-id>/bucket/<my-bucket-name>``. For example, to access the bucket ``reports`` through Outpost ``my-outpost`` owned by account ``123456789012`` in Region ``us-west-2``, use the URL encoding of ``arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/bucket/reports``.
