  .. note::

    

    This operation is not supported by directory buckets.

    

   

  Returns a list of the Multi-Region Access Points currently associated with the specified Amazon Web Services account. Each call can return up to 100 Multi-Region Access Points, the maximum number of Multi-Region Access Points that can be associated with a single account.

   

  This action will always be routed to the US West (Oregon) Region. For more information about the restrictions around working with Multi-Region Access Points, see `Multi-Region Access Point restrictions and limitations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/MultiRegionAccessPointRestrictions.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **AccessPoints** *(list) --* 

        The list of Multi-Region Access Points associated with the user.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          A collection of statuses for a Multi-Region Access Point in the various Regions it supports.

          
          

          - **Name** *(string) --* 

            The name of the Multi-Region Access Point.

            
          

          - **Alias** *(string) --* 

            The alias for the Multi-Region Access Point. For more information about the distinction between the name and the alias of an Multi-Region Access Point, see `Rules for naming Amazon S3 Multi-Region Access Points <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/CreatingMultiRegionAccessPoints.html#multi-region-access-point-naming>`__.

            
          

          - **CreatedAt** *(datetime) --* 

            When the Multi-Region Access Point create request was received.

            
          

          - **PublicAccessBlock** *(dict) --* 

            The ``PublicAccessBlock`` configuration that you want to apply to this Amazon S3 account. You can enable the configuration options in any combination. For more information about when Amazon S3 considers a bucket or object public, see `The Meaning of "Public" <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/access-control-block-public-access.html#access-control-block-public-access-policy-status>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

             

            This data type is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

            
            

            - **BlockPublicAcls** *(boolean) --* 

              Specifies whether Amazon S3 should block public access control lists (ACLs) for buckets in this account. Setting this element to ``TRUE`` causes the following behavior:

               

              
              * ``PutBucketAcl`` and ``PutObjectAcl`` calls fail if the specified ACL is public.
               
              * PUT Object calls fail if the request includes a public ACL.
               
              * PUT Bucket calls fail if the request includes a public ACL.
              

               

              Enabling this setting doesn't affect existing policies or ACLs.

               

              This property is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

              
            

            - **IgnorePublicAcls** *(boolean) --* 

              Specifies whether Amazon S3 should ignore public ACLs for buckets in this account. Setting this element to ``TRUE`` causes Amazon S3 to ignore all public ACLs on buckets in this account and any objects that they contain.

               

              Enabling this setting doesn't affect the persistence of any existing ACLs and doesn't prevent new public ACLs from being set.

               

              This property is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

              
            

            - **BlockPublicPolicy** *(boolean) --* 

              Specifies whether Amazon S3 should block public bucket policies for buckets in this account. Setting this element to ``TRUE`` causes Amazon S3 to reject calls to PUT Bucket policy if the specified bucket policy allows public access.

               

              Enabling this setting doesn't affect existing bucket policies.

               

              This property is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

              
            

            - **RestrictPublicBuckets** *(boolean) --* 

              Specifies whether Amazon S3 should restrict public bucket policies for buckets in this account. Setting this element to ``TRUE`` restricts access to buckets with public policies to only Amazon Web Services service principals and authorized users within this account.

               

              Enabling this setting doesn't affect previously stored bucket policies, except that public and cross-account access within any public bucket policy, including non-public delegation to specific accounts, is blocked.

               

              This property is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

              
        
          

          - **Status** *(string) --* 

            The current status of the Multi-Region Access Point.

             

            ``CREATING`` and ``DELETING`` are temporary states that exist while the request is propagating and being completed. If a Multi-Region Access Point has a status of ``PARTIALLY_CREATED``, you can retry creation or send a request to delete the Multi-Region Access Point. If a Multi-Region Access Point has a status of ``PARTIALLY_DELETED``, you can retry a delete request to finish the deletion of the Multi-Region Access Point.

            
          

          - **Regions** *(list) --* 

            A collection of the Regions and buckets associated with the Multi-Region Access Point.

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

              A combination of a bucket and Region that's part of a Multi-Region Access Point.

              
              

              - **Bucket** *(string) --* 

                The name of the bucket.

                
              

              - **Region** *(string) --* 

                The name of the Region.

                
              

              - **BucketAccountId** *(string) --* 

                The Amazon Web Services account ID that owns the Amazon S3 bucket that's associated with this Multi-Region Access Point.

                
          
        
      
    
      

      - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

        If the specified bucket has more Multi-Region Access Points than can be returned in one call to this action, this field contains a continuation token. You can use this token tin subsequent calls to this action to retrieve additional Multi-Region Access Points.
