.. py:method:: S3Control.Client.delete_bucket_replication(**kwargs)

  

  .. note::

    

    This operation deletes an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket's replication configuration. To delete an S3 bucket's replication configuration, see `DeleteBucketReplication <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_DeleteBucketReplication.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 API Reference*.

    

   

  Deletes the replication configuration from the specified S3 on Outposts bucket.

   

  To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the ``s3-outposts:PutReplicationConfiguration`` action. The Outposts bucket owner has this permission by default and can grant it to others. For more information about permissions, see `Setting up IAM with S3 on Outposts <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3OutpostsIAM.html>`__ and `Managing access to S3 on Outposts buckets <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3OutpostsBucketPolicy.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

   

  .. note::

    

    It can take a while to propagate ``PUT`` or ``DELETE`` requests for a replication configuration to all S3 on Outposts systems. Therefore, the replication configuration that's returned by a ``GET`` request soon after a ``PUT`` or ``DELETE`` request might return a more recent result than what's on the Outpost. If an Outpost is offline, the delay in updating the replication configuration on that Outpost can be significant.

    

   

  All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an additional parameter of ``x-amz-outpost-id`` to be passed with the request. In addition, you must use an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of ``s3-control``. For an example of the request syntax for Amazon S3 on Outposts that uses the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix and the ``x-amz-outpost-id`` derived by using the access point ARN, see the `Examples <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_DeleteBucketReplication.html#API_control_DeleteBucketReplication_Examples>`__ section.

   

  For information about S3 replication on Outposts configuration, see `Replicating objects for S3 on Outposts <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3OutpostsReplication.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.delete_bucket_replication(
        AccountId='string',
        Bucket='string'
    )
    
  :type AccountId: string
  :param AccountId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The Amazon Web Services account ID of the Outposts bucket to delete the replication configuration for.

    

  
  :type Bucket: string
  :param Bucket: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies the S3 on Outposts bucket to delete the replication configuration for.

     

    For using this parameter with Amazon S3 on Outposts with the REST API, you must specify the name and the x-amz-outpost-id as well.

     

    For using this parameter with S3 on Outposts with the Amazon Web Services SDK and CLI, you must specify the ARN of the bucket accessed in the format ``arn:aws:s3-outposts:<Region>:<account-id>:outpost/<outpost-id>/bucket/<my-bucket-name>``. For example, to access the bucket ``reports`` through Outpost ``my-outpost`` owned by account ``123456789012`` in Region ``us-west-2``, use the URL encoding of ``arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/bucket/reports``. The value must be URL encoded.
