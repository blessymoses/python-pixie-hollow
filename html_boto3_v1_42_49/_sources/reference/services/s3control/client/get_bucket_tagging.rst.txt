.. py:method:: S3Control.Client.get_bucket_tagging(**kwargs)

  

  .. note::

    

    This action gets an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket's tags. To get an S3 bucket tags, see `GetBucketTagging <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetBucketTagging.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 API Reference*.

    

   

  Returns the tag set associated with the Outposts bucket. For more information, see `Using Amazon S3 on Outposts <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

   

  To use this action, you must have permission to perform the ``GetBucketTagging`` action. By default, the bucket owner has this permission and can grant this permission to others.

   

  ``GetBucketTagging`` has the following special error:

   

  
  * Error code: ``NoSuchTagSetError`` 

    
    * Description: There is no tag set associated with the bucket.
    

  
  

   

  All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an additional parameter of ``x-amz-outpost-id`` to be passed with the request. In addition, you must use an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of ``s3-control``. For an example of the request syntax for Amazon S3 on Outposts that uses the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix and the ``x-amz-outpost-id`` derived by using the access point ARN, see the `Examples <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_GetBucketTagging.html#API_control_GetBucketTagging_Examples>`__ section.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.get_bucket_tagging(
        AccountId='string',
        Bucket='string'
    )
    
  :type AccountId: string
  :param AccountId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The Amazon Web Services account ID of the Outposts bucket.

    

  
  :type Bucket: string
  :param Bucket: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies the bucket.

     

    For using this parameter with Amazon S3 on Outposts with the REST API, you must specify the name and the x-amz-outpost-id as well.

     

    For using this parameter with S3 on Outposts with the Amazon Web Services SDK and CLI, you must specify the ARN of the bucket accessed in the format ``arn:aws:s3-outposts:<Region>:<account-id>:outpost/<outpost-id>/bucket/<my-bucket-name>``. For example, to access the bucket ``reports`` through Outpost ``my-outpost`` owned by account ``123456789012`` in Region ``us-west-2``, use the URL encoding of ``arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/bucket/reports``. The value must be URL encoded.
