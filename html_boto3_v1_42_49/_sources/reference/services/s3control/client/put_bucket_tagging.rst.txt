.. py:method:: S3Control.Client.put_bucket_tagging(**kwargs)

  

  .. note::

    

    This action puts tags on an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket. To put tags on an S3 bucket, see `PutBucketTagging <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketTagging.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 API Reference*.

    

   

  Sets the tags for an S3 on Outposts bucket. For more information, see `Using Amazon S3 on Outposts <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

   

  Use tags to organize your Amazon Web Services bill to reflect your own cost structure. To do this, sign up to get your Amazon Web Services account bill with tag key values included. Then, to see the cost of combined resources, organize your billing information according to resources with the same tag key values. For example, you can tag several resources with a specific application name, and then organize your billing information to see the total cost of that application across several services. For more information, see `Cost allocation and tagging <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-alloc-tags.html>`__.

   

  .. note::

    

    Within a bucket, if you add a tag that has the same key as an existing tag, the new value overwrites the old value. For more information, see `Using cost allocation in Amazon S3 bucket tags <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/CostAllocTagging.html>`__.

    

   

  To use this action, you must have permissions to perform the ``s3-outposts:PutBucketTagging`` action. The Outposts bucket owner has this permission by default and can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see `Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources>`__ and `Managing access permissions to your Amazon S3 resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html>`__.

  All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an additional parameter of ``x-amz-outpost-id`` to be passed with the request. In addition, you must use an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of ``s3-control``. For an example of the request syntax for Amazon S3 on Outposts that uses the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix and the ``x-amz-outpost-id`` derived by using the access point ARN, see the `Examples <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_PutBucketTagging.html#API_control_PutBucketTagging_Examples>`__ section.

                {
                    'Key': 'string',
                    'Value': 'string'
                },
