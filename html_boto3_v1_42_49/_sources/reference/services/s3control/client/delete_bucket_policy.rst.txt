.. py:method:: S3Control.Client.delete_bucket_policy(**kwargs)

  

  .. note::

    

    This action deletes an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket policy. To delete an S3 bucket policy, see `DeleteBucketPolicy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_DeleteBucketPolicy.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 API Reference*.

    

   

  This implementation of the DELETE action uses the policy subresource to delete the policy of a specified Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket. If you are using an identity other than the root user of the Amazon Web Services account that owns the bucket, the calling identity must have the ``s3-outposts:DeleteBucketPolicy`` permissions on the specified Outposts bucket and belong to the bucket owner's account to use this action. For more information, see `Using Amazon S3 on Outposts <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html>`__ in *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

   

  If you don't have ``DeleteBucketPolicy`` permissions, Amazon S3 returns a ``403 Access Denied`` error. If you have the correct permissions, but you're not using an identity that belongs to the bucket owner's account, Amazon S3 returns a ``405 Method Not Allowed`` error.

   

  .. warning::

     

    As a security precaution, the root user of the Amazon Web Services account that owns a bucket can always use this action, even if the policy explicitly denies the root user the ability to perform this action.

     

   

  For more information about bucket policies, see `Using Bucket Policies and User Policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-iam-policies.html>`__.

   

  All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an additional parameter of ``x-amz-outpost-id`` to be passed with the request. In addition, you must use an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of ``s3-control``. For an example of the request syntax for Amazon S3 on Outposts that uses the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix and the ``x-amz-outpost-id`` derived by using the access point ARN, see the `Examples <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_DeleteBucketPolicy.html#API_control_DeleteBucketPolicy_Examples>`__ section.

   

  The following actions are related to ``DeleteBucketPolicy``:

   

  
  * `GetBucketPolicy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_GetBucketPolicy.html>`__
   
  * `PutBucketPolicy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_PutBucketPolicy.html>`__

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.delete_bucket_policy(
        AccountId='string',
        Bucket='string'
    )
    
  :type AccountId: string
  :param AccountId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The account ID of the Outposts bucket.

    

  
  :type Bucket: string
  :param Bucket: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies the bucket.

     

    For using this parameter with Amazon S3 on Outposts with the REST API, you must specify the name and the x-amz-outpost-id as well.

     

    For using this parameter with S3 on Outposts with the Amazon Web Services SDK and CLI, you must specify the ARN of the bucket accessed in the format ``arn:aws:s3-outposts:<Region>:<account-id>:outpost/<outpost-id>/bucket/<my-bucket-name>``. For example, to access the bucket ``reports`` through Outpost ``my-outpost`` owned by account ``123456789012`` in Region ``us-west-2``, use the URL encoding of ``arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/bucket/reports``. The value must be URL encoded.
