.. py:method:: S3Control.Client.create_access_grants_location(**kwargs)

  

  The S3 data location that you would like to register in your S3 Access Grants instance. Your S3 data must be in the same Region as your S3 Access Grants instance. The location can be one of the following:

   

  
  * The default S3 location ``s3://``
   
  * A bucket - ``S3://<bucket-name>``
   
  * A bucket and prefix - ``S3://<bucket-name>/<prefix>``
  

   

  When you register a location, you must include the IAM role that has permission to manage the S3 location that you are registering. Give S3 Access Grants permission to assume this role `using a policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-grants-location.html>`__. S3 Access Grants assumes this role to manage access to the location and to vend temporary credentials to grantees or client applications.
