.. py:method:: S3Control.Client.put_bucket_replication(**kwargs)

  

  .. note::

    

    This action creates an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket's replication configuration. To create an S3 bucket's replication configuration, see `PutBucketReplication <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketReplication.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 API Reference*.

    

   

  Creates a replication configuration or replaces an existing one. For information about S3 replication on Outposts configuration, see `Replicating objects for S3 on Outposts <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3OutpostsReplication.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

   

  .. note::

    

    It can take a while to propagate ``PUT`` or ``DELETE`` requests for a replication configuration to all S3 on Outposts systems. Therefore, the replication configuration that's returned by a ``GET`` request soon after a ``PUT`` or ``DELETE`` request might return a more recent result than what's on the Outpost. If an Outpost is offline, the delay in updating the replication configuration on that Outpost can be significant.

    

   

  Specify the replication configuration in the request body. In the replication configuration, you provide the following information:

   

  
  * The name of the destination bucket or buckets where you want S3 on Outposts to replicate objects
   
  * The Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that S3 on Outposts can assume to replicate objects on your behalf
   
  * Other relevant information, such as replication rules
  

   

  A replication configuration must include at least one rule and can contain a maximum of 100. Each rule identifies a subset of objects to replicate by filtering the objects in the source Outposts bucket. To choose additional subsets of objects to replicate, add a rule for each subset.

   

  To specify a subset of the objects in the source Outposts bucket to apply a replication rule to, add the ``Filter`` element as a child of the ``Rule`` element. You can filter objects based on an object key prefix, one or more object tags, or both. When you add the ``Filter`` element in the configuration, you must also add the following elements: ``DeleteMarkerReplication``, ``Status``, and ``Priority``.

   

  Using ``PutBucketReplication`` on Outposts requires that both the source and destination buckets must have versioning enabled. For information about enabling versioning on a bucket, see `Managing S3 Versioning for your S3 on Outposts bucket <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3OutpostsManagingVersioning.html>`__.

   

  For information about S3 on Outposts replication failure reasons, see `Replication failure reasons <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/outposts-replication-eventbridge.html#outposts-replication-failure-codes>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

   

  **Handling Replication of Encrypted Objects**

   

  Outposts buckets are encrypted at all times. All the objects in the source Outposts bucket are encrypted and can be replicated. Also, all the replicas in the destination Outposts bucket are encrypted with the same encryption key as the objects in the source Outposts bucket.

   

  **Permissions**

   

  To create a ``PutBucketReplication`` request, you must have ``s3-outposts:PutReplicationConfiguration`` permissions for the bucket. The Outposts bucket owner has this permission by default and can grant it to others. For more information about permissions, see `Setting up IAM with S3 on Outposts <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3OutpostsIAM.html>`__ and `Managing access to S3 on Outposts buckets <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3OutpostsBucketPolicy.html>`__.

   

  .. note::

    

    To perform this operation, the user or role must also have the ``iam:CreateRole`` and ``iam:PassRole`` permissions. For more information, see `Granting a user permissions to pass a role to an Amazon Web Services service <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_passrole.html>`__.

    

   

  All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an additional parameter of ``x-amz-outpost-id`` to be passed with the request. In addition, you must use an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of ``s3-control``. For an example of the request syntax for Amazon S3 on Outposts that uses the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix and the ``x-amz-outpost-id`` derived by using the access point ARN, see the `Examples <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_PutBucketReplication.html#API_control_PutBucketReplication_Examples>`__ section.

   

  The following operations are related to ``PutBucketReplication``:

   

  
  * `GetBucketReplication <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_GetBucketReplication.html>`__
   
  * `DeleteBucketReplication <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_DeleteBucketReplication.html>`__

  :type AccountId: string
  :param AccountId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The Amazon Web Services account ID of the Outposts bucket.

    

  
  :type Bucket: string
  :param Bucket: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies the S3 on Outposts bucket to set the configuration for.

     

    For using this parameter with Amazon S3 on Outposts with the REST API, you must specify the name and the x-amz-outpost-id as well.

     

    For using this parameter with S3 on Outposts with the Amazon Web Services SDK and CLI, you must specify the ARN of the bucket accessed in the format ``arn:aws:s3-outposts:<Region>:<account-id>:outpost/<outpost-id>/bucket/<my-bucket-name>``. For example, to access the bucket ``reports`` through Outpost ``my-outpost`` owned by account ``123456789012`` in Region ``us-west-2``, use the URL encoding of ``arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/bucket/reports``. The value must be URL encoded.

        - **Priority** *(integer) --* 

          The priority indicates which rule has precedence whenever two or more replication rules conflict. S3 on Outposts attempts to replicate objects according to all replication rules. However, if there are two or more rules with the same destination Outposts bucket, then objects will be replicated according to the rule with the highest priority. The higher the number, the higher the priority.

           

          For more information, see `Creating replication rules on Outposts <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/replication-between-outposts.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

            .. note::

              

              This is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts buckets.

              

            

          
            - **Status** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

              Specifies whether Amazon S3 replicates objects that are created with server-side encryption by using an KMS key stored in Key Management Service.

              

            
          
          - **ReplicaModifications** *(dict) --* 

            A filter that you can use to specify whether replica modification sync is enabled. S3 on Outposts replica modification sync can help you keep object metadata synchronized between replicas and source objects. By default, S3 on Outposts replicates metadata from the source objects to the replicas only. When replica modification sync is enabled, S3 on Outposts replicates metadata changes made to the replica copies back to the source object, making the replication bidirectional.

             

            To replicate object metadata modifications on replicas, you can specify this element and set the ``Status`` of this element to ``Enabled``.

             

            .. note::

              

              You must enable replica modification sync on the source and destination buckets to replicate replica metadata changes between the source and the replicas.

              

            

          
            - **Status** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

          - **AccessControlTranslation** *(dict) --* 

            Specify this property only in a cross-account scenario (where the source and destination bucket owners are not the same), and you want to change replica ownership to the Amazon Web Services account that owns the destination bucket. If this property is not specified in the replication configuration, the replicas are owned by same Amazon Web Services account that owns the source object.

             

            .. note::

              

              This is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts buckets.

This ID is either the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the KMS key or the alias ARN for the KMS key. Amazon S3 uses this KMS key to encrypt replica objects. Amazon S3 supports only symmetric encryption KMS keys. For more information, see `Symmetric encryption KMS keys <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#symmetric-cmks>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

              

            
          
          - **Metrics** *(dict) --* 

            A container that specifies replication metrics-related settings.

            

          
            - **Status** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

              Specifies whether replication metrics are enabled.

              

            
            - **EventThreshold** *(dict) --* 

              A container that specifies the time threshold for emitting the ``s3:Replication:OperationMissedThreshold`` event.

               

              .. note::

                

                This is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts buckets.

                

              

            
              - **Minutes** *(integer) --* 

                Contains an integer that specifies the time period in minutes.

                 

                Valid value: 15

                

              
            
          
          - **StorageClass** *(string) --* 

            The storage class to use when replicating objects. All objects stored on S3 on Outposts are stored in the ``OUTPOSTS`` storage class. S3 on Outposts uses the ``OUTPOSTS`` storage class to create the object replicas.

             

            .. note::

              

              Values other than ``OUTPOSTS`` aren't supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.

              

            

          
        
        - **DeleteMarkerReplication** *(dict) --* 

          Specifies whether S3 on Outposts replicates delete markers. If you specify a ``Filter`` element in your replication configuration, you must also include a ``DeleteMarkerReplication`` element. If your ``Filter`` includes a ``Tag`` element, the ``DeleteMarkerReplication`` element's ``Status`` child element must be set to ``Disabled``, because S3 on Outposts doesn't support replicating delete markers for tag-based rules.

           

          For more information about delete marker replication, see `How delete operations affect replication <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3OutpostsReplication.html#outposts-replication-what-is-replicated>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

          

        
          - **Status** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            Indicates whether to replicate delete markers.

            

          
        
        - **Bucket** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the access point for the source Outposts bucket that you want S3 on Outposts to replicate the objects from.
