.. py:method:: S3Control.Client.list_access_points_for_object_lambda(**kwargs)

  

  .. note::

    

    This operation is not supported by directory buckets.

    

   

  Returns some or all (up to 1,000) access points associated with the Object Lambda Access Point per call. If there are more access points than what can be returned in one call, the response will include a continuation token that you can use to list the additional access points.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_access_points_for_object_lambda(
        AccountId='string',
        NextToken='string',
        MaxResults=123
    )
    
  :type AccountId: string
  :param AccountId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The account ID for the account that owns the specified Object Lambda Access Point.

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    If the list has more access points than can be returned in one call to this API, this field contains a continuation token that you can provide in subsequent calls to this API to retrieve additional access points.

    

  
  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    The maximum number of access points that you want to include in the list. The response may contain fewer access points but will never contain more. If there are more than this number of access points, then the response will include a continuation token in the ``NextToken`` field that you can use to retrieve the next page of access points.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **ObjectLambdaAccessPointList** *(list) --* 

        Returns list of Object Lambda Access Points.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          An access point with an attached Lambda function used to access transformed data from an Amazon S3 bucket.

          
          

          - **Name** *(string) --* 

            The name of the Object Lambda Access Point.

            
          

          - **ObjectLambdaAccessPointArn** *(string) --* 

            Specifies the ARN for the Object Lambda Access Point.

            
          

          - **Alias** *(dict) --* 

            The alias of the Object Lambda Access Point.

            
            

            - **Value** *(string) --* 

              The alias value of the Object Lambda Access Point.

              
            

            - **Status** *(string) --* 

              The status of the Object Lambda Access Point alias. If the status is ``PROVISIONING``, the Object Lambda Access Point is provisioning the alias and the alias is not ready for use yet. If the status is ``READY``, the Object Lambda Access Point alias is successfully provisioned and ready for use.

              
        
      
    
      

      - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

        If the list has more access points than can be returned in one call to this API, this field contains a continuation token that you can provide in subsequent calls to this API to retrieve additional access points.
