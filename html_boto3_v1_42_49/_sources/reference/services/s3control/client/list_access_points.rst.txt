.. py:method:: S3Control.Client.list_access_points(**kwargs)

  

  .. note::

    

    This operation is not supported by directory buckets.

    

   

  Returns a list of the access points. You can retrieve up to 1,000 access points per call. If the call returns more than 1,000 access points (or the number specified in ``maxResults``, whichever is less), the response will include a continuation token that you can use to list the additional access points.

   

  Returns only access points attached to S3 buckets by default. To return all access points specify ``DataSourceType`` as ``ALL``.

   

  

   

  All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an additional parameter of ``x-amz-outpost-id`` to be passed with the request. In addition, you must use an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of ``s3-control``. For an example of the request syntax for Amazon S3 on Outposts that uses the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix and the ``x-amz-outpost-id`` derived by using the access point ARN, see the `Examples <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_GetAccessPoint.html#API_control_GetAccessPoint_Examples>`__ section.

   

  The following actions are related to ``ListAccessPoints``:

   

  
  * `CreateAccessPoint <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_CreateAccessPoint.html>`__
   
  * `DeleteAccessPoint <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_DeleteAccessPoint.html>`__

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_access_points(
        AccountId='string',
        Bucket='string',
        NextToken='string',
        MaxResults=123,
        DataSourceId='string',
        DataSourceType='string'
    )
    
  :type AccountId: string
  :param AccountId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The Amazon Web Services account ID for the account that owns the specified access points.

    

  
  :type Bucket: string
  :param Bucket: 

    The name of the bucket whose associated access points you want to list.

     

    For using this parameter with Amazon S3 on Outposts with the REST API, you must specify the name and the x-amz-outpost-id as well.

     

    For using this parameter with S3 on Outposts with the Amazon Web Services SDK and CLI, you must specify the ARN of the bucket accessed in the format ``arn:aws:s3-outposts:<Region>:<account-id>:outpost/<outpost-id>/bucket/<my-bucket-name>``. For example, to access the bucket ``reports`` through Outpost ``my-outpost`` owned by account ``123456789012`` in Region ``us-west-2``, use the URL encoding of ``arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/bucket/reports``. The value must be URL encoded.

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    A continuation token. If a previous call to ``ListAccessPoints`` returned a continuation token in the ``NextToken`` field, then providing that value here causes Amazon S3 to retrieve the next page of results.

    

  
  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    The maximum number of access points that you want to include in the list. If the specified bucket has more than this number of access points, then the response will include a continuation token in the ``NextToken`` field that you can use to retrieve the next page of access points.

    

  
  :type DataSourceId: string
  :param DataSourceId: 

    The unique identifier for the data source of the access point.

    

  
  :type DataSourceType: string
  :param DataSourceType: 

    The type of the data source that the access point is attached to. Returns only access points attached to S3 buckets by default. To return all access points specify ``DataSourceType`` as ``ALL``.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **AccessPointList** *(list) --* 

        Contains identification and configuration information for one or more access points associated with the specified bucket.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          An access point used to access a bucket.

          
          

          - **Name** *(string) --* 

            The name of this access point.

            
          

          - **NetworkOrigin** *(string) --* 

            Indicates whether this access point allows access from the public internet. If ``VpcConfiguration`` is specified for this access point, then ``NetworkOrigin`` is ``VPC``, and the access point doesn't allow access from the public internet. Otherwise, ``NetworkOrigin`` is ``Internet``, and the access point allows access from the public internet, subject to the access point and bucket access policies.

            
          

          - **VpcConfiguration** *(dict) --*
