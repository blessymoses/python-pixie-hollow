  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.create_access_grants_instance(
        AccountId='string',
        IdentityCenterArn='string',
        Tags=[
            {
                'Key': 'string',
                'Value': 'string'
            },
        ]
    )
    
  :type AccountId: string
  :param AccountId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The Amazon Web Services account ID of the S3 Access Grants instance.

    

  
  :type IdentityCenterArn: string
  :param IdentityCenterArn: 

    If you would like to associate your S3 Access Grants instance with an Amazon Web Services IAM Identity Center instance, use this field to pass the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Web Services IAM Identity Center instance that you are associating with your S3 Access Grants instance. An IAM Identity Center instance is your corporate identity directory that you added to the IAM Identity Center. You can use the `ListInstances <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/APIReference/API_ListInstances.html>`__ API operation to retrieve a list of your Identity Center instances and their ARNs.

    

  
  :type Tags: list
  :param Tags: 

    The Amazon Web Services resource tags that you are adding to the S3 Access Grants instance. Each tag is a label consisting of a user-defined key and value. Tags can help you manage, identify, organize, search for, and filter resources.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      A key-value pair that you use to label your resources. You can add tags to new resources when you create them, or you can add tags to existing resources. Tags can help you organize, track costs for, and control access to resources.

      

    
      - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The key of the key-value pair of a tag added to your Amazon Web Services resource. A tag key can be up to 128 Unicode characters in length and is case-sensitive. System created tags that begin with ``aws:`` aren’t supported.

        

      
      - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The value of the key-value pair of a tag added to your Amazon Web Services resource. A tag value can be up to 256 Unicode characters in length and is case-sensitive.
