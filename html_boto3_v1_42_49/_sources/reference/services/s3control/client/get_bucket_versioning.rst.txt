.. py:method:: S3Control.Client.get_bucket_versioning(**kwargs)

  

  .. note::

    

    This operation returns the versioning state for S3 on Outposts buckets only. To return the versioning state for an S3 bucket, see `GetBucketVersioning <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetBucketVersioning.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 API Reference*.

    

   

  Returns the versioning state for an S3 on Outposts bucket. With S3 Versioning, you can save multiple distinct copies of your objects and recover from unintended user actions and application failures.

   

  If you've never set versioning on your bucket, it has no versioning state. In that case, the ``GetBucketVersioning`` request does not return a versioning state value.

   

  For more information about versioning, see `Versioning <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Versioning.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

   

  All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an additional parameter of ``x-amz-outpost-id`` to be passed with the request. In addition, you must use an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of ``s3-control``. For an example of the request syntax for Amazon S3 on Outposts that uses the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix and the ``x-amz-outpost-id`` derived by using the access point ARN, see the `Examples <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_GetBucketVersioning.html#API_control_GetBucketVersioning_Examples>`__ section.
