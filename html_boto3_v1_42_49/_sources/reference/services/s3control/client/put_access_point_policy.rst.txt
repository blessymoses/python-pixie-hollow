.. py:method:: S3Control.Client.put_access_point_policy(**kwargs)

  

  Associates an access policy with the specified access point. Each access point can have only one policy, so a request made to this API replaces any existing policy associated with the specified access point.

   

  

   

  All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an additional parameter of ``x-amz-outpost-id`` to be passed with the request. In addition, you must use an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of ``s3-control``. For an example of the request syntax for Amazon S3 on Outposts that uses the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix and the ``x-amz-outpost-id`` derived by using the access point ARN, see the `Examples <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_PutAccessPointPolicy.html#API_control_PutAccessPointPolicy_Examples>`__ section.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.put_access_point_policy(
        AccountId='string',
        Name='string',
        Policy='string'
    )
    
  :type AccountId: string
  :param AccountId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The Amazon Web Services account ID for owner of the bucket associated with the specified access point.

    

  
  :type Name: string
  :param Name: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of the access point that you want to associate with the specified policy.

     

    For using this parameter with Amazon S3 on Outposts with the REST API, you must specify the name and the x-amz-outpost-id as well.

     

    For using this parameter with S3 on Outposts with the Amazon Web Services SDK and CLI, you must specify the ARN of the access point accessed in the format ``arn:aws:s3-outposts:<Region>:<account-id>:outpost/<outpost-id>/accesspoint/<my-accesspoint-name>``. For example, to access the access point ``reports-ap`` through Outpost ``my-outpost`` owned by account ``123456789012`` in Region ``us-west-2``, use the URL encoding of ``arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/accesspoint/reports-ap``. The value must be URL encoded.

    

  
  :type Policy: string
  :param Policy: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The policy that you want to apply to the specified access point. For more information about access point policies, see `Managing data access with Amazon S3 access points <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-points.html>`__ or `Managing access to shared datasets in directory buckets with access points <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-points-directory-buckets.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
