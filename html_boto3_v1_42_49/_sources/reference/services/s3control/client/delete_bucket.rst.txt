.. py:method:: S3Control.Client.delete_bucket(**kwargs)

  

  .. note::

    

    This action deletes an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket. To delete an S3 bucket, see `DeleteBucket <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_DeleteBucket.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 API Reference*.

    

   

  Deletes the Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket. All objects (including all object versions and delete markers) in the bucket must be deleted before the bucket itself can be deleted. For more information, see `Using Amazon S3 on Outposts <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html>`__ in *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

   

  All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an additional parameter of ``x-amz-outpost-id`` to be passed with the request. In addition, you must use an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of ``s3-control``. For an example of the request syntax for Amazon S3 on Outposts that uses the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix and the ``x-amz-outpost-id`` derived by using the access point ARN, see the `Examples <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_DeleteBucket.html#API_control_DeleteBucket_Examples>`__ section.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.delete_bucket(
        AccountId='string',
        Bucket='string'
    )
    
  :type AccountId: string
  :param AccountId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The account ID that owns the Outposts bucket.

    

  
  :type Bucket: string
  :param Bucket: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies the bucket being deleted.

     

    For using this parameter with Amazon S3 on Outposts with the REST API, you must specify the name and the x-amz-outpost-id as well.

     

    For using this parameter with S3 on Outposts with the Amazon Web Services SDK and CLI, you must specify the ARN of the bucket accessed in the format ``arn:aws:s3-outposts:<Region>:<account-id>:outpost/<outpost-id>/bucket/<my-bucket-name>``. For example, to access the bucket ``reports`` through Outpost ``my-outpost`` owned by account ``123456789012`` in Region ``us-west-2``, use the URL encoding of ``arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/bucket/reports``. The value must be URL encoded.
