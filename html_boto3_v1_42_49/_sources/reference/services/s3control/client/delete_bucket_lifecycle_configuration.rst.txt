.. py:method:: S3Control.Client.delete_bucket_lifecycle_configuration(**kwargs)

  

  .. note::

    

    This action deletes an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket's lifecycle configuration. To delete an S3 bucket's lifecycle configuration, see `DeleteBucketLifecycle <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_DeleteBucketLifecycle.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 API Reference*.

    

   

  Deletes the lifecycle configuration from the specified Outposts bucket. Amazon S3 on Outposts removes all the lifecycle configuration rules in the lifecycle subresource associated with the bucket. Your objects never expire, and Amazon S3 on Outposts no longer automatically deletes any objects on the basis of rules contained in the deleted lifecycle configuration. For more information, see `Using Amazon S3 on Outposts <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html>`__ in *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

   

  To use this operation, you must have permission to perform the ``s3-outposts:PutLifecycleConfiguration`` action. By default, the bucket owner has this permission and the Outposts bucket owner can grant this permission to others.

   

  All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an additional parameter of ``x-amz-outpost-id`` to be passed with the request. In addition, you must use an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of ``s3-control``. For an example of the request syntax for Amazon S3 on Outposts that uses the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix and the ``x-amz-outpost-id`` derived by using the access point ARN, see the `Examples <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_DeleteBucketLifecycleConfiguration.html#API_control_DeleteBucketLifecycleConfiguration_Examples>`__ section.

   

  For more information about object expiration, see `Elements to Describe Lifecycle Actions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/intro-lifecycle-rules.html#intro-lifecycle-rules-actions>`__.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.delete_bucket_lifecycle_configuration(
        AccountId='string',
        Bucket='string'
    )
    
  :type AccountId: string
  :param AccountId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The account ID of the lifecycle configuration to delete.

    

  
  :type Bucket: string
  :param Bucket: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies the bucket.

     

    For using this parameter with Amazon S3 on Outposts with the REST API, you must specify the name and the x-amz-outpost-id as well.

     

    For using this parameter with S3 on Outposts with the Amazon Web Services SDK and CLI, you must specify the ARN of the bucket accessed in the format ``arn:aws:s3-outposts:<Region>:<account-id>:outpost/<outpost-id>/bucket/<my-bucket-name>``. For example, to access the bucket ``reports`` through Outpost ``my-outpost`` owned by account ``123456789012`` in Region ``us-west-2``, use the URL encoding of ``arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/bucket/reports``. The value must be URL encoded.
