          - **ExcludedPages** *(list) --* 

            A list of URLs in your website or application to exclude from RUM data collection.

             

            You can't include both ``ExcludedPages`` and ``IncludedPages`` in the same operation.

            
            

            - *(string) --* 
        
          

          - **IncludedPages** *(list) --* 

            If this app monitor is to collect data from only certain pages in your application, this structure lists those pages.

             

            You can't include both ``ExcludedPages`` and ``IncludedPages`` in the same operation.

            
            

            - *(string) --* 
        
          

          - **FavoritePages** *(list) --* 

            A list of pages in your application that are to be displayed with a "favorite" icon in the CloudWatch RUM console.

            
            

            - *(string) --* 
        
          

          - **SessionSampleRate** *(float) --* 

            Specifies the portion of user sessions to use for RUM data collection. Choosing a higher portion gives you more data but also incurs more costs.

             

            The range for this value is 0 to 1 inclusive. Setting this to 1 means that 100% of user sessions are sampled, and setting it to 0.1 means that 10% of user sessions are sampled.

             

            If you omit this parameter, the default of 0.1 is used, and 10% of sessions will be sampled.

            
          

          - **GuestRoleArn** *(string) --* 

            The ARN of the guest IAM role that is attached to the Amazon Cognito identity pool that is used to authorize the sending of data to RUM.

             

            .. note::

              

              It is possible that an app monitor does not have a value for ``GuestRoleArn``. For example, this can happen when you use the console to create an app monitor and you allow CloudWatch RUM to create a new identity pool for Authorization. In this case, ``GuestRoleArn`` is not present in the `GetAppMonitor <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatchrum/latest/APIReference/API_GetAppMonitor.html>`__ response because it is not stored by the service.

               

              If this issue affects you, you can take one of the following steps:

               

              
              * Use the Cloud Development Kit (CDK) to create an identity pool and the associated IAM role, and use that for your app monitor.
               
              * Make a separate `GetIdentityPoolRoles <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognitoidentity/latest/APIReference/API_GetIdentityPoolRoles.html>`__ call to Amazon Cognito to retrieve the ``GuestRoleArn``.
              

              

            
          

          - **AllowCookies** *(boolean) --* 

            If you set this to ``true``, the RUM web client sets two cookies, a session cookie and a user cookie. The cookies allow the RUM web client to collect data relating to the number of users an application has and the behavior of the application across a sequence of events. Cookies are stored in the top-level domain of the current page.

            
          

          - **Telemetries** *(list) --* 

            An array that lists the types of telemetry data that this app monitor is to collect.

             

            
            * ``errors`` indicates that RUM collects data about unhandled JavaScript errors raised by your application.
             
            * ``performance`` indicates that RUM collects performance data about how your application and its resources are loaded and rendered. This includes Core Web Vitals.
             
            * ``http`` indicates that RUM collects data about HTTP errors thrown by your application.
            

            
            

            - *(string) --* 
        
          

          - **EnableXRay** *(boolean) --* 

            If you set this to ``true``, RUM enables X-Ray tracing for the user sessions that RUM samples. RUM adds an X-Ray trace header to allowed HTTP requests. It also records an X-Ray segment for allowed HTTP requests. You can see traces and segments from these user sessions in the X-Ray console and the CloudWatch ServiceLens console. For more information, see `What is X-Ray? <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/aws-xray.html>`__

          - **CwLog** *(dict) --* 

            A structure that contains the information about whether the app monitor stores copies of the data that RUM collects in CloudWatch Logs. If it does, this structure also contains the name of the log group.

            
            

            - **CwLogEnabled** *(boolean) --* 

              Indicated whether the app monitor stores copies of the data that RUM collects in CloudWatch Logs.

              
            

            - **CwLogGroup** *(string) --* 

              The name of the log group where the copies are stored.

              
        
      
        

        - **CustomEvents** *(dict) --* 

          Specifies whether this app monitor allows the web client to define and send custom events.

           

          For more information about custom events, see `Send custom events <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-RUM-custom-events.html>`__.

          
          

          - **Status** *(string) --* 

            Specifies whether this app monitor allows the web client to define and send custom events. The default is for custom events to be ``DISABLED``.

            
      
        

        - **DeobfuscationConfiguration** *(dict) --*

            A structure that contains the configuration for how an app monitor can unminify JavaScript error stack traces using source maps.

            
            

            - **Status** *(string) --* 

              Specifies whether JavaScript error stack traces should be unminified for this app monitor. The default is for JavaScript error stack trace unminification to be ``DISABLED``.

              
            

            - **S3Uri** *(string) --* 

              The S3Uri of the bucket or folder that stores the source map files. It is required if status is ENABLED.

              
        
      
        

        - **Platform** *(string) --*
