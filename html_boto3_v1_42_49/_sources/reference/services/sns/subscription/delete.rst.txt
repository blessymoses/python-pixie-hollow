.. py:method:: SNS.Subscription.delete()

  

  Deletes a subscription. If the subscription requires authentication for deletion, only the owner of the subscription or the topic's owner can unsubscribe, and an Amazon Web Services signature is required. If the ``Unsubscribe`` call does not require authentication and the requester is not the subscription owner, a final cancellation message is delivered to the endpoint, so that the endpoint owner can easily resubscribe to the topic if the ``Unsubscribe`` request was unintended.

   

  This action is throttled at 100 transactions per second (TPS).
