.. py:attribute:: SNS.Topic.attributes

  

  - *(dict) --* 

    A map of the topic's attributes. Attributes in this map include the following:

     

    
    * ``DeliveryPolicy`` – The JSON serialization of the topic's delivery policy.
     
    * ``DisplayName`` – The human-readable name used in the ``From`` field for notifications to ``email`` and ``email-json`` endpoints.
     
    * ``EffectiveDeliveryPolicy`` – The JSON serialization of the effective delivery policy, taking system defaults into account.
     
    * ``Owner`` – The Amazon Web Services account ID of the topic's owner.
     
    * ``Policy`` – The JSON serialization of the topic's access control policy.
     
    * ``SignatureVersion`` – The signature version corresponds to the hashing algorithm used while creating the signature of the notifications, subscription confirmations, or unsubscribe confirmation messages sent by Amazon SNS. 

      
      * By default, ``SignatureVersion`` is set to **1**. The signature is a Base64-encoded **SHA1withRSA** signature.
       
      * When you set ``SignatureVersion`` to **2**. Amazon SNS uses a Base64-encoded **SHA256withRSA** signature. 

      .. note::

        If the API response does not include the ``SignatureVersion`` attribute, it means that the ``SignatureVersion`` for the topic has value **1**.

      
      

    
     
    * ``SubscriptionsConfirmed`` – The number of confirmed subscriptions for the topic.
     
    * ``SubscriptionsDeleted`` – The number of deleted subscriptions for the topic.
     
    * ``SubscriptionsPending`` – The number of subscriptions pending confirmation for the topic.
     
    * ``TopicArn`` – The topic's ARN.
     
    * ``TracingConfig`` – Tracing mode of an Amazon SNS topic. By default ``TracingConfig`` is set to ``PassThrough``, and the topic passes through the tracing header it receives from an Amazon SNS publisher to its subscriptions. If set to ``Active``, Amazon SNS will vend X-Ray segment data to topic owner account if the sampled flag in the tracing header is true. This is only supported on standard topics.
    

     

    The following attribute applies only to `server-side-encryption <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-server-side-encryption.html>`__:

     

    
    * ``KmsMasterKeyId`` - The ID of an Amazon Web Services managed customer master key (CMK) for Amazon SNS or a custom CMK. For more information, see `Key Terms <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-server-side-encryption.html#sse-key-terms>`__. For more examples, see `KeyId <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeKey.html#API_DescribeKey_RequestParameters>`__ in the *Key Management Service API Reference*.
    

     

    The following attributes apply only to `FIFO topics <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-fifo-topics.html>`__:

     

    
    * ``ArchivePolicy`` – The policy that sets the retention period for messages stored in the message archive of an Amazon SNS FIFO topic.
     
    * ``BeginningArchiveTime`` – The earliest starting point at which a message in the topic’s archive can be replayed from. This point in time is based on the configured message retention period set by the topic’s message archiving policy.
     
    * ``ContentBasedDeduplication`` – Enables content-based deduplication for FIFO topics. 

      
      * By default, ``ContentBasedDeduplication`` is set to ``false``. If you create a FIFO topic and this attribute is ``false``, you must specify a value for the ``MessageDeduplicationId`` parameter for the `Publish <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/api/API_Publish.html>`__ action.
       
      * When you set ``ContentBasedDeduplication`` to ``true``, Amazon SNS uses a SHA-256 hash to generate the ``MessageDeduplicationId`` using the body of the message (but not the attributes of the message). (Optional) To override the generated value, you can specify a value for the ``MessageDeduplicationId`` parameter for the ``Publish`` action.
      

    
     
    * ``FifoTopic`` – When this is set to ``true``, a FIFO topic is created.
