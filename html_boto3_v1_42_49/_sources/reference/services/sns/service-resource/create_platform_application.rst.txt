.. py:method:: SNS.ServiceResource.create_platform_application(**kwargs)

  

  Creates a platform application object for one of the supported push notification services, such as APNS and GCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging), to which devices and mobile apps may register. You must specify ``PlatformPrincipal`` and ``PlatformCredential`` attributes when using the ``CreatePlatformApplication`` action.

   

  ``PlatformPrincipal`` and ``PlatformCredential`` are received from the notification service.

   

  
  * For ADM, ``PlatformPrincipal`` is ``client id`` and ``PlatformCredential`` is ``client secret``.
   
  * For APNS and ``APNS_SANDBOX`` using certificate credentials, ``PlatformPrincipal`` is ``SSL certificate`` and ``PlatformCredential`` is ``private key``.
   
  * For APNS and ``APNS_SANDBOX`` using token credentials, ``PlatformPrincipal`` is ``signing key ID`` and ``PlatformCredential`` is ``signing key``.
   
  * For Baidu, ``PlatformPrincipal`` is ``API key`` and ``PlatformCredential`` is ``secret key``.
   
  * For GCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging) using key credentials, there is no ``PlatformPrincipal``. The ``PlatformCredential`` is ``API key``.
   
  * For GCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging) using token credentials, there is no ``PlatformPrincipal``. The ``PlatformCredential`` is a JSON formatted private key file. When using the Amazon Web Services CLI or Amazon Web Services SDKs, the file must be in string format and special characters must be ignored. To format the file correctly, Amazon SNS recommends using the following command: ``SERVICE_JSON=$(jq @json < service.json)``.
   
  * For MPNS, ``PlatformPrincipal`` is ``TLS certificate`` and ``PlatformCredential`` is ``private key``.
   
  * For WNS, ``PlatformPrincipal`` is ``Package Security Identifier`` and ``PlatformCredential`` is ``secret key``.
  

   

  You can use the returned ``PlatformApplicationArn`` as an attribute for the ``CreatePlatformEndpoint`` action.
