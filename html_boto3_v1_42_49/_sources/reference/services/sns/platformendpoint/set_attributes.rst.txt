  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = platform_endpoint.set_attributes(
        Attributes={
            'string': 'string'
        }
    )
    
  :type Attributes: dict
  :param Attributes: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A map of the endpoint attributes. Attributes in this map include the following:

     

    
    * ``CustomUserData`` – arbitrary user data to associate with the endpoint. Amazon SNS does not use this data. The data must be in UTF-8 format and less than 2KB.
     
    * ``Enabled`` – flag that enables/disables delivery to the endpoint. Amazon SNS will set this to false when a notification service indicates to Amazon SNS that the endpoint is invalid. Users can set it back to true, typically after updating Token.
     
    * ``Token`` – device token, also referred to as a registration id, for an app and mobile device. This is returned from the notification service when an app and mobile device are registered with the notification service.
