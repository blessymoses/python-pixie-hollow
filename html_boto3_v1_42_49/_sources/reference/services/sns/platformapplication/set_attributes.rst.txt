  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = platform_application.set_attributes(
        Attributes={
            'string': 'string'
        }
    )
    
  :type Attributes: dict
  :param Attributes: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A map of the platform application attributes. Attributes in this map include the following:

     

    
    * ``PlatformCredential`` – The credential received from the notification service. 

      
      * For ADM, ``PlatformCredential``is client secret.
       
      * For Apple Services using certificate credentials, ``PlatformCredential`` is private key.
       
      * For Apple Services using token credentials, ``PlatformCredential`` is signing key.
       
      * For GCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging) using key credentials, there is no ``PlatformPrincipal``. The ``PlatformCredential`` is ``API key``.
       
      * For GCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging) using token credentials, there is no ``PlatformPrincipal``. The ``PlatformCredential`` is a JSON formatted private key file. When using the Amazon Web Services CLI, the file must be in string format and special characters must be ignored. To format the file correctly, Amazon SNS recommends using the following command: ``SERVICE_JSON=`jq @json <<< cat service.json```.
      

    
    

     

    
    * ``PlatformPrincipal`` – The principal received from the notification service. 

      
      * For ADM, ``PlatformPrincipal``is client id.
       
      * For Apple Services using certificate credentials, ``PlatformPrincipal`` is SSL certificate.
       
      * For Apple Services using token credentials, ``PlatformPrincipal`` is signing key ID.
       
      * For GCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging), there is no ``PlatformPrincipal``.

    * ``SuccessFeedbackSampleRate`` – Sample rate percentage (0-100) of successfully delivered messages.
    

     

    The following attributes only apply to ``APNs`` token-based authentication:
