.. py:method:: SNS.PlatformApplication.create_platform_endpoint(**kwargs)

  

  Creates an endpoint for a device and mobile app on one of the supported push notification services, such as GCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging) and APNS. ``CreatePlatformEndpoint`` requires the ``PlatformApplicationArn`` that is returned from ``CreatePlatformApplication``. You can use the returned ``EndpointArn`` to send a message to a mobile app or by the ``Subscribe`` action for subscription to a topic. The ``CreatePlatformEndpoint`` action is idempotent, so if the requester already owns an endpoint with the same device token and attributes, that endpoint's ARN is returned without creating a new endpoint. For more information, see `Using Amazon SNS Mobile Push Notifications <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/SNSMobilePush.html>`__.

   

  When using ``CreatePlatformEndpoint`` with Baidu, two attributes must be provided: ChannelId and UserId. The token field must also contain the ChannelId. For more information, see `Creating an Amazon SNS Endpoint for Baidu <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/SNSMobilePushBaiduEndpoint.html>`__.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    platform_endpoint = platform_application.create_platform_endpoint(
        Token='string',
        CustomUserData='string',
        Attributes={
            'string': 'string'
        }
    )
    
  :type Token: string
  :param Token: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Unique identifier created by the notification service for an app on a device. The specific name for Token will vary, depending on which notification service is being used. For example, when using APNS as the notification service, you need the device token. Alternatively, when using GCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging) or ADM, the device token equivalent is called the registration ID.

    

  
  :type CustomUserData: string
  :param CustomUserData: 

    Arbitrary user data to associate with the endpoint. Amazon SNS does not use this data. The data must be in UTF-8 format and less than 2KB.

    

  
  :type Attributes: dict
  :param Attributes: 

    For a list of attributes, see `SetEndpointAttributes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/api/API_SetEndpointAttributes.html>`__.
