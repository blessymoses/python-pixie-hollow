    :type Filters: list
    :param Filters: 

      An optional specification to return a subset of Resolver rules, such as Resolver rules that are associated with the same VPC ID.

       

      .. note::

        

        If you submit a second or subsequent ``ListResolverRuleAssociations`` request and specify the ``NextToken`` parameter, you must use the same values for ``Filters``, if any, as in the previous request.

        

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        For Resolver list operations ( `ListResolverEndpoints <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverEndpoints.html>`__, `ListResolverRules <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverRules.html>`__, `ListResolverRuleAssociations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverRuleAssociations.html>`__, `ListResolverQueryLogConfigs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverQueryLogConfigs.html>`__, `ListResolverQueryLogConfigAssociations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverQueryLogConfigAssociations.html>`__), and `ListResolverDnssecConfigs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverDnssecConfigs.html>`__), an optional specification to return a subset of objects.

         

        To filter objects, such as Resolver endpoints or Resolver rules, you specify ``Name`` and ``Values``. For example, to list only inbound Resolver endpoints, specify ``Direction`` for ``Name`` and specify ``INBOUND`` for ``Values``.

        

      
        - **Name** *(string) --* 

          The name of the parameter that you want to use to filter objects.

           

          The valid values for ``Name`` depend on the action that you're including the filter in, `ListResolverEndpoints <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverEndpoints.html>`__, `ListResolverRules <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverRules.html>`__, `ListResolverRuleAssociations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverRuleAssociations.html>`__, `ListResolverQueryLogConfigs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverQueryLogConfigs.html>`__, or `ListResolverQueryLogConfigAssociations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverQueryLogConfigAssociations.html>`__.

           

          .. note::

            

            In early versions of Resolver, values for ``Name`` were listed as uppercase, with underscore (_) delimiters. For example, ``CreatorRequestId`` was originally listed as ``CREATOR_REQUEST_ID``. Uppercase values for ``Name`` are still supported.

            

           

          **ListResolverEndpoints**

           

          Valid values for ``Name`` include the following:

           

          
          * ``CreatorRequestId``: The value that you specified when you created the Resolver endpoint.
           
          * ``Direction``: Whether you want to return inbound or outbound Resolver endpoints. If you specify ``DIRECTION`` for ``Name``, specify ``INBOUND`` or ``OUTBOUND`` for ``Values``.
           
          * ``HostVPCId``: The ID of the VPC that inbound DNS queries pass through on the way from your network to your VPCs in a region, or the VPC that outbound queries pass through on the way from your VPCs to your network. In a `CreateResolverEndpoint <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_CreateResolverEndpoint.html>`__ request, ``SubnetId`` indirectly identifies the VPC. In a `GetResolverEndpoint <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_GetResolverEndpoint.html>`__ request, the VPC ID for a Resolver endpoint is returned in the ``HostVPCId`` element.
           
          * ``IpAddressCount``: The number of IP addresses that you have associated with the Resolver endpoint.
           
          * ``Name``: The name of the Resolver endpoint.
           
          * ``SecurityGroupIds``: The IDs of the VPC security groups that you specified when you created the Resolver endpoint.
           
          * ``Status``: The status of the Resolver endpoint. If you specify ``Status`` for ``Name``, specify one of the following status codes for ``Values``: ``CREATING``, ``OPERATIONAL``, ``UPDATING``, ``AUTO_RECOVERING``, ``ACTION_NEEDED``, or ``DELETING``. For more information, see ``Status`` in `ResolverEndpoint <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ResolverEndpoint.html>`__.
          

           

          **ListResolverRules**

           

          Valid values for ``Name`` include the following:

           

          
          * ``CreatorRequestId``: The value that you specified when you created the Resolver rule.
           
          * ``DomainName``: The domain name for which Resolver is forwarding DNS queries to your network. In the value that you specify for ``Values``, include a trailing dot (.) after the domain name. For example, if the domain name is example.com, specify the following value. Note the "." after ``com``: ``example.com.``
           
          * ``Name``: The name of the Resolver rule.
           
          * ``ResolverEndpointId``: The ID of the Resolver endpoint that the Resolver rule is associated with. 

          .. note::

            You can filter on the Resolver endpoint only for rules that have a value of ``FORWARD`` for ``RuleType``.

          
           
          * ``Status``: The status of the Resolver rule. If you specify ``Status`` for ``Name``, specify one of the following status codes for ``Values``: ``COMPLETE``, ``DELETING``, ``UPDATING``, or ``FAILED``.
           
          * ``Type``: The type of the Resolver rule. If you specify ``TYPE`` for ``Name``, specify ``FORWARD`` or ``SYSTEM`` for ``Values``.
          

           

          **ListResolverRuleAssociations**

           

          Valid values for ``Name`` include the following:

           

          
          * ``Name``: The name of the Resolver rule association.
           
          * ``ResolverRuleId``: The ID of the Resolver rule that is associated with one or more VPCs.
           
          * ``Status``: The status of the Resolver rule association. If you specify ``Status`` for ``Name``, specify one of the following status codes for ``Values``: ``CREATING``, ``COMPLETE``, ``DELETING``, or ``FAILED``.
           
          * ``VPCId``: The ID of the VPC that the Resolver rule is associated with.

          * ``AssociationCount``: The number of VPCs that are associated with the query logging configuration.
           
          * ``CreationTime``: The date and time that the query logging configuration was created, in Unix time format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
           
          * ``CreatorRequestId``: A unique string that identifies the request that created the query logging configuration.
           
          * ``Destination``: The Amazon Web Services service that you want to forward query logs to. Valid values include the following: 

            
            * ``S3``
             
            * ``CloudWatchLogs``
             
            * ``KinesisFirehose``
            

          
           
          * ``DestinationArn``: The ARN of the location that Resolver is sending query logs to. This value can be the ARN for an S3 bucket, a CloudWatch Logs log group, or a Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream.
           
          * ``Id``: The ID of the query logging configuration
           
          * ``Name``: The name of the query logging configuration
