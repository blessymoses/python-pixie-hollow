    :type FirewallRuleGroupId: string
    :param FirewallRuleGroupId: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The unique identifier of the firewall rule group that you want to retrieve the rules for.

      

    
    :type Priority: integer
    :param Priority: 

      Optional additional filter for the rules to retrieve.

       

      The setting that determines the processing order of the rules in a rule group. DNS Firewall processes the rules in a rule group by order of priority, starting from the lowest setting.

      

    
    :type Action: string
    :param Action: 

      Optional additional filter for the rules to retrieve.

       

      The action that DNS Firewall should take on a DNS query when it matches one of the domains in the rule's domain list, or a threat in a DNS Firewall Advanced rule:

       

      
      * ``ALLOW`` - Permit the request to go through. Not availabe for DNS Firewall Advanced rules.
       
      * ``ALERT`` - Permit the request to go through but send an alert to the logs.
       
      * ``BLOCK`` - Disallow the request. If this is specified, additional handling details are provided in the rule's ``BlockResponse`` setting.
      

      

    
    :type PaginationConfig: dict
    :param PaginationConfig: 

      A dictionary that provides parameters to control pagination.

      

    
      - **MaxItems** *(integer) --* 

        The total number of items to return. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified in max-items then a ``NextToken`` will be provided in the output that you can use to resume pagination.

        

      
      - **PageSize** *(integer) --* 

        The size of each page.

        

      
      - **StartingToken** *(string) --*

              * ``DGA``: Domain generation algorithms detection. DGAs are used by attackers to generate a large number of domains to to launch malware attacks.
               
              * ``DNS_TUNNELING``: DNS tunneling detection. DNS tunneling is used by attackers to exfiltrate data from the client by using the DNS tunnel without making a network connection to the client.

              * ``LOW``: Provides the highest detection rate for threats, but also increases false positives.
               
              * ``MEDIUM``: Provides a balance between detecting threats and false positives.
               
              * ``HIGH``: Detects only the most well corroborated threats with a low rate of false positives.
