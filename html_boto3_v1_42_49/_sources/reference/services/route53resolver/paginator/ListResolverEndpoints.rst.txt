    :param Filters: 

      An optional specification to return a subset of Resolver endpoints, such as all inbound Resolver endpoints.

       

      .. note::

        

        If you submit a second or subsequent ``ListResolverEndpoints`` request and specify the ``NextToken`` parameter, you must use the same values for ``Filters``, if any, as in the previous request.

        

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        For Resolver list operations ( `ListResolverEndpoints <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverEndpoints.html>`__, `ListResolverRules <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverRules.html>`__, `ListResolverRuleAssociations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverRuleAssociations.html>`__, `ListResolverQueryLogConfigs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverQueryLogConfigs.html>`__, `ListResolverQueryLogConfigAssociations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverQueryLogConfigAssociations.html>`__), and `ListResolverDnssecConfigs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverDnssecConfigs.html>`__), an optional specification to return a subset of objects.

         

        To filter objects, such as Resolver endpoints or Resolver rules, you specify ``Name`` and ``Values``. For example, to list only inbound Resolver endpoints, specify ``Direction`` for ``Name`` and specify ``INBOUND`` for ``Values``.

        

      
        - **Name** *(string) --* 

          The name of the parameter that you want to use to filter objects.

           

          The valid values for ``Name`` depend on the action that you're including the filter in, `ListResolverEndpoints <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverEndpoints.html>`__, `ListResolverRules <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverRules.html>`__, `ListResolverRuleAssociations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverRuleAssociations.html>`__, `ListResolverQueryLogConfigs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverQueryLogConfigs.html>`__, or `ListResolverQueryLogConfigAssociations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverQueryLogConfigAssociations.html>`__.

           

          .. note::

            

            In early versions of Resolver, values for ``Name`` were listed as uppercase, with underscore (_) delimiters. For example, ``CreatorRequestId`` was originally listed as ``CREATOR_REQUEST_ID``. Uppercase values for ``Name`` are still supported.

            

           

          **ListResolverEndpoints**

           

          Valid values for ``Name`` include the following:

           

          
          * ``CreatorRequestId``: The value that you specified when you created the Resolver endpoint.
           
          * ``Direction``: Whether you want to return inbound or outbound Resolver endpoints. If you specify ``DIRECTION`` for ``Name``, specify ``INBOUND`` or ``OUTBOUND`` for ``Values``.
           
          * ``HostVPCId``: The ID of the VPC that inbound DNS queries pass through on the way from your network to your VPCs in a region, or the VPC that outbound queries pass through on the way from your VPCs to your network. In a `CreateResolverEndpoint <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_CreateResolverEndpoint.html>`__ request, ``SubnetId`` indirectly identifies the VPC. In a `GetResolverEndpoint <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_GetResolverEndpoint.html>`__ request, the VPC ID for a Resolver endpoint is returned in the ``HostVPCId`` element.
           
          * ``IpAddressCount``: The number of IP addresses that you have associated with the Resolver endpoint.
           
          * ``Name``: The name of the Resolver endpoint.
           
          * ``SecurityGroupIds``: The IDs of the VPC security groups that you specified when you created the Resolver endpoint.
           
          * ``Status``: The status of the Resolver endpoint. If you specify ``Status`` for ``Name``, specify one of the following status codes for ``Values``: ``CREATING``, ``OPERATIONAL``, ``UPDATING``, ``AUTO_RECOVERING``, ``ACTION_NEEDED``, or ``DELETING``. For more information, see ``Status`` in `ResolverEndpoint <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ResolverEndpoint.html>`__.
          

           

          **ListResolverRules**

          * ``DomainName``: The domain name for which Resolver is forwarding DNS queries to your network. In the value that you specify for ``Values``, include a trailing dot (.) after the domain name. For example, if the domain name is example.com, specify the following value. Note the "." after ``com``: ``example.com.``
           
          * ``Name``: The name of the Resolver rule.
           
          * ``ResolverEndpointId``: The ID of the Resolver endpoint that the Resolver rule is associated with. 

          .. note::

            You can filter on the Resolver endpoint only for rules that have a value of ``FORWARD`` for ``RuleType``.

          
           
          * ``Status``: The status of the Resolver rule. If you specify ``Status`` for ``Name``, specify one of the following status codes for ``Values``: ``COMPLETE``, ``DELETING``, ``UPDATING``, or ``FAILED``.
           
          * ``Type``: The type of the Resolver rule. If you specify ``TYPE`` for ``Name``, specify ``FORWARD`` or ``SYSTEM`` for ``Values``.
          

           

          **ListResolverRuleAssociations**

           

          Valid values for ``Name`` include the following:

            - **SecurityGroupIds** *(list) --* 

              The ID of one or more security groups that control access to this VPC. The security group must include one or more inbound rules (for inbound endpoints) or outbound rules (for outbound endpoints). Inbound and outbound rules must allow TCP and UDP access. For inbound access, open port 53. For outbound access, open the port that you're using for DNS queries on your network.

              
              

              - *(string) --* 
          
            

            - **Direction** *(string) --* 

              Indicates whether the Resolver endpoint allows inbound or outbound DNS queries:

               

              
              * ``INBOUND``: allows DNS queries to your VPC from your network
               
              * ``OUTBOUND``: allows DNS queries from your VPC to your network
               
              * ``INBOUND_DELEGATION``: Resolver delegates queries to Route 53 private hosted zones from your network.
              

              
            

            - **IpAddressCount** *(integer) --* 

              The number of IP addresses that the Resolver endpoint can use for DNS queries.

              
            

            - **HostVPCId** *(string) --* 

              The ID of the VPC that you want to create the Resolver endpoint in.

              
            

            - **Status** *(string) --* 

              A code that specifies the current status of the Resolver endpoint. Valid values include the following:

               

              
              * ``CREATING``: Resolver is creating and configuring one or more Amazon VPC network interfaces for this endpoint.
               
              * ``OPERATIONAL``: The Amazon VPC network interfaces for this endpoint are correctly configured and able to pass inbound or outbound DNS queries between your network and Resolver.
               
              * ``UPDATING``: Resolver is associating or disassociating one or more network interfaces with this endpoint.
               
              * ``AUTO_RECOVERING``: Resolver is trying to recover one or more of the network interfaces that are associated with this endpoint. During the recovery process, the endpoint functions with limited capacity because of the limit on the number of DNS queries per IP address (per network interface). For the current limit, see `Limits on Route 53 Resolver <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/DNSLimitations.html#limits-api-entities-resolver>`__.
               
              * ``ACTION_NEEDED``: This endpoint is unhealthy, and Resolver can't automatically recover it. To resolve the problem, we recommend that you check each IP address that you associated with the endpoint. For each IP address that isn't available, add another IP address and then delete the IP address that isn't available. (An endpoint must always include at least two IP addresses.) A status of ``ACTION_NEEDED`` can have a variety of causes. Here are two common causes: 

                
                * One or more of the network interfaces that are associated with the endpoint were deleted using Amazon VPC.
                 
                * The network interface couldn't be created for some reason that's outside the control of Resolver.
                

              
               
              * ``DELETING``: Resolver is deleting this endpoint and the associated network interfaces.
              

              
            

            - **StatusMessage** *(string) --* 

              A detailed description of the status of the Resolver endpoint.

              
            

            - **CreationTime** *(string) --* 

              The date and time that the endpoint was created, in Unix time format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

              
            

            - **ModificationTime** *(string) --* 

              The date and time that the endpoint was last modified, in Unix time format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

              
            

            - **OutpostArn** *(string) --* 

              The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) for the Outpost.

              
            

            - **PreferredInstanceType** *(string) --*

            - **ResolverEndpointType** *(string) --* 

              The Resolver endpoint IP address type.

              
            

            - **Protocols** *(list) --* 

              Protocols used for the endpoint. DoH-FIPS is applicable for a default inbound endpoints only.

               

              For an inbound endpoint you can apply the protocols as follows:

               

              
              * Do53 and DoH in combination.
               
              * Do53 and DoH-FIPS in combination.
               
              * Do53 alone.
               
              * DoH alone.
               
              * DoH-FIPS alone.
               
              * None, which is treated as Do53.
              

               

              For a delegation inbound endpoint you can use Do53 only.

               

              For an outbound endpoint you can apply the protocols as follows:

               

              
              * Do53 and DoH in combination.
               
              * Do53 alone.
               
              * DoH alone.
               
              * None, which is treated as Do53.
