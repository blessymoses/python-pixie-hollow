.. py:method:: Route53Resolver.Client.delete_resolver_query_log_config(**kwargs)

  

  Deletes a query logging configuration. When you delete a configuration, Resolver stops logging DNS queries for all of the Amazon VPCs that are associated with the configuration. This also applies if the query logging configuration is shared with other Amazon Web Services accounts, and the other accounts have associated VPCs with the shared configuration.

   

  Before you can delete a query logging configuration, you must first disassociate all VPCs from the configuration. See `DisassociateResolverQueryLogConfig <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_DisassociateResolverQueryLogConfig.html>`__.

   

  If you used Resource Access Manager (RAM) to share a query logging configuration with other accounts, you must stop sharing the configuration before you can delete a configuration. The accounts that you shared the configuration with can first disassociate VPCs that they associated with the configuration, but that's not necessary. If you stop sharing the configuration, those VPCs are automatically disassociated from the configuration.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **ResolverQueryLogConfig** *(dict) --* 

        Information about the query logging configuration that you deleted, including the status of the request.

        
        

        - **Id** *(string) --* 

          The ID for the query logging configuration.

          
        

        - **OwnerId** *(string) --* 

          The Amazon Web Services account ID for the account that created the query logging configuration.

          
        

        - **Status** *(string) --* 

          The status of the specified query logging configuration. Valid values include the following:

           

          
          * ``CREATING``: Resolver is creating the query logging configuration.
           
          * ``CREATED``: The query logging configuration was successfully created. Resolver is logging queries that originate in the specified VPC.
           
          * ``DELETING``: Resolver is deleting this query logging configuration.
           
          * ``FAILED``: Resolver can't deliver logs to the location that is specified in the query logging configuration. Here are two common causes: 

            
            * The specified destination (for example, an Amazon S3 bucket) was deleted.
             
            * Permissions don't allow sending logs to the destination.
            

          
          

          
        

        - **ShareStatus** *(string) --* 

          An indication of whether the query logging configuration is shared with other Amazon Web Services accounts, or was shared with the current account by another Amazon Web Services account. Sharing is configured through Resource Access Manager (RAM).

          
        

        - **AssociationCount** *(integer) --* 

          The number of VPCs that are associated with the query logging configuration.

          
        

        - **Arn** *(string) --* 

          The ARN for the query logging configuration.

          
        

        - **Name** *(string) --* 

          The name of the query logging configuration.

          
        

        - **DestinationArn** *(string) --* 

          The ARN of the resource that you want Resolver to send query logs: an Amazon S3 bucket, a CloudWatch Logs log group, or a Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream.

          
        

        - **CreatorRequestId** *(string) --* 

          A unique string that identifies the request that created the query logging configuration. The ``CreatorRequestId`` allows failed requests to be retried without the risk of running the operation twice.

          
        

        - **CreationTime** *(string) --* 

          The date and time that the query logging configuration was created, in Unix time format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
