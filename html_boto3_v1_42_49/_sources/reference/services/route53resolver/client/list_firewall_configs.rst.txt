.. py:method:: Route53Resolver.Client.list_firewall_configs(**kwargs)

  

  Retrieves the firewall configurations that you have defined. DNS Firewall uses the configurations to manage firewall behavior for your VPCs.

   

  A single call might return only a partial list of the configurations. For information, see ``MaxResults``.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_firewall_configs(
        MaxResults=123,
        NextToken='string'
    )
    
  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    The maximum number of objects that you want Resolver to return for this request. If more objects are available, in the response, Resolver provides a ``NextToken`` value that you can use in a subsequent call to get the next batch of objects.

     

    If you don't specify a value for ``MaxResults``, Resolver returns up to 100 objects.

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    For the first call to this list request, omit this value.

     

    When you request a list of objects, Resolver returns at most the number of objects specified in ``MaxResults``. If more objects are available for retrieval, Resolver returns a ``NextToken`` value in the response. To retrieve the next batch of objects, use the token that was returned for the prior request in your next request.

    **Response Syntax**

    
    ::

      {
          'NextToken': 'string',
          'FirewallConfigs': [
              {
                  'Id': 'string',
                  'ResourceId': 'string',
                  'OwnerId': 'string',

      }
      
    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

        If objects are still available for retrieval, Resolver returns this token in the response. To retrieve the next batch of objects, provide this token in your next request.

        
      

      - **FirewallConfigs** *(list) --* 

        The configurations for the firewall behavior provided by DNS Firewall for VPCs from Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC).

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          Configuration of the firewall behavior provided by DNS Firewall for a single VPC from Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC).

          
          

          - **Id** *(string) --* 

            The ID of the firewall configuration.

            
          

          - **ResourceId** *(string) --* 

            The ID of the VPC that this firewall configuration applies to.

            
          

          - **OwnerId** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Web Services account ID of the owner of the VPC that this firewall configuration applies to.

            
          

          - **FirewallFailOpen** *(string) --* 

            Determines how DNS Firewall operates during failures, for example when all traffic that is sent to DNS Firewall fails to receive a reply.

             

            
            * By default, fail open is disabled, which means the failure mode is closed. This approach favors security over availability. DNS Firewall returns a failure error when it is unable to properly evaluate a query.
             
            * If you enable this option, the failure mode is open. This approach favors availability over security. DNS Firewall allows queries to proceed if it is unable to properly evaluate them.
            

             

            This behavior is only enforced for VPCs that have at least one DNS Firewall rule group association.
