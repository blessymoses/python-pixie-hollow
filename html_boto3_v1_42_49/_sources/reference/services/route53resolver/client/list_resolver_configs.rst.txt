.. py:method:: Route53Resolver.Client.list_resolver_configs(**kwargs)

  

  Retrieves the Resolver configurations that you have defined. Route 53 Resolver uses the configurations to manage DNS resolution behavior for your VPCs.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_resolver_configs(
        MaxResults=123,
        NextToken='string'
    )
    
  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    The maximum number of Resolver configurations that you want to return in the response to a ``ListResolverConfigs`` request. If you don't specify a value for ``MaxResults``, up to 100 Resolver configurations are returned.

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    (Optional) If the current Amazon Web Services account has more than ``MaxResults`` Resolver configurations, use ``NextToken`` to get the second and subsequent pages of results.

     

    For the first ``ListResolverConfigs`` request, omit this value.

     

    For the second and subsequent requests, get the value of ``NextToken`` from the previous response and specify that value for ``NextToken`` in the request.

    **Response Syntax**

    
    ::

      {
          'NextToken': 'string',
          'ResolverConfigs': [
              {
                  'Id': 'string',
                  'ResourceId': 'string',
                  'OwnerId': 'string',
                  'AutodefinedReverse': 'ENABLING'|'ENABLED'|'DISABLING'|'DISABLED'|'UPDATING_TO_USE_LOCAL_RESOURCE_SETTING'|'USE_LOCAL_RESOURCE_SETTING'
              },
          ]
      }
      
    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

        If a response includes the last of the Resolver configurations that are associated with the current Amazon Web Services account, ``NextToken`` doesn't appear in the response.

         

        If a response doesn't include the last of the configurations, you can get more configurations by submitting another ``ListResolverConfigs`` request. Get the value of ``NextToken`` that Amazon Route 53 returned in the previous response and include it in ``NextToken`` in the next request.

        
      

      - **ResolverConfigs** *(list) --* 

        An array that contains one ``ResolverConfigs`` element for each Resolver configuration that is associated with the current Amazon Web Services account.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          A complex type that contains information about a Resolver configuration for a VPC.

          
          

          - **Id** *(string) --* 

            ID for the Resolver configuration.

            
          

          - **ResourceId** *(string) --* 

            The ID of the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud VPC or a Route 53 Profile that you're configuring Resolver for.

            
          

          - **OwnerId** *(string) --* 

            The owner account ID of the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud VPC.

            
          

          - **AutodefinedReverse** *(string) --* 

            The status of whether or not the Resolver will create autodefined rules for reverse DNS lookups. This is enabled by default. The status can be one of following:

             

            
            * **ENABLING:** Autodefined rules for reverse DNS lookups are being enabled but are not complete.
             
            * **ENABLED:** Autodefined rules for reverse DNS lookups are enabled.
             
            * **DISABLING:** Autodefined rules for reverse DNS lookups are being disabled but are not complete.
             
            * **DISABLED:** Autodefined rules for reverse DNS lookups are disabled.
