.. py:method:: Route53Resolver.Client.disassociate_resolver_query_log_config(**kwargs)

  

  Disassociates a VPC from a query logging configuration.

   

  .. note::

    

    Before you can delete a query logging configuration, you must first disassociate all VPCs from the configuration. If you used Resource Access Manager (RAM) to share a query logging configuration with other accounts, VPCs can be disassociated from the configuration in the following ways:

     

    
    * The accounts that you shared the configuration with can disassociate VPCs from the configuration.
     
    * You can stop sharing the configuration.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **ResolverQueryLogConfigAssociation** *(dict) --* 

        A complex type that contains settings for the association that you deleted between an Amazon VPC and a query logging configuration.

        
        

        - **Id** *(string) --* 

          The ID of the query logging association.

          
        

        - **ResolverQueryLogConfigId** *(string) --* 

          The ID of the query logging configuration that a VPC is associated with.

          
        

        - **ResourceId** *(string) --* 

          The ID of the Amazon VPC that is associated with the query logging configuration.

          
        

        - **Status** *(string) --* 

          The status of the specified query logging association. Valid values include the following:

           

          
          * ``CREATING``: Resolver is creating an association between an Amazon VPC and a query logging configuration.
           
          * ``ACTIVE``: The association between an Amazon VPC and a query logging configuration was successfully created. Resolver is logging queries that originate in the specified VPC.
           
          * ``DELETING``: Resolver is deleting this query logging association.
           
          * ``FAILED``: Resolver either couldn't create or couldn't delete the query logging association.
          

          
        

        - **Error** *(string) --* 

          If the value of ``Status`` is ``FAILED``, the value of ``Error`` indicates the cause:

           

          
          * ``DESTINATION_NOT_FOUND``: The specified destination (for example, an Amazon S3 bucket) was deleted.
           
          * ``ACCESS_DENIED``: Permissions don't allow sending logs to the destination.
          

           

          If the value of ``Status`` is a value other than ``FAILED``, ``Error`` is null.

          
        

        - **ErrorMessage** *(string) --* 

          Contains additional information about the error. If the value or ``Error`` is null, the value of ``ErrorMessage`` also is null.

          
        

        - **CreationTime** *(string) --* 

          The date and time that the VPC was associated with the query logging configuration, in Unix time format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
