.. py:method:: Route53Resolver.Client.create_resolver_endpoint(**kwargs)

  

  Creates a Resolver endpoint. There are two types of Resolver endpoints, inbound and outbound:

   

  
  * An *inbound Resolver endpoint* forwards DNS queries to the DNS service for a VPC from your network.
   
  * An *outbound Resolver endpoint* forwards DNS queries from the DNS service for a VPC to your network.

        TargetNameServerMetricsEnabled=True|False
    )
    
  :type CreatorRequestId: string
  :param CreatorRequestId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A unique string that identifies the request and that allows failed requests to be retried without the risk of running the operation twice. ``CreatorRequestId`` can be any unique string, for example, a date/time stamp.

    

  
  :type Name: string
  :param Name: 

    A friendly name that lets you easily find a configuration in the Resolver dashboard in the Route 53 console.

    

  
  :type SecurityGroupIds: list
  :param SecurityGroupIds: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ID of one or more security groups that you want to use to control access to this VPC. The security group that you specify must include one or more inbound rules (for inbound Resolver endpoints) or outbound rules (for outbound Resolver endpoints). Inbound and outbound rules must allow TCP and UDP access. For inbound access, open port 53. For outbound access, open the port that you're using for DNS queries on your network.

     

    Some security group rules will cause your connection to be tracked. For outbound resolver endpoint, it can potentially impact the maximum queries per second from outbound endpoint to your target name server. For inbound resolver endpoint, it can bring down the overall maximum queries per second per IP address to as low as 1500. To avoid connection tracking caused by security group, see `Untracked connections <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/security-group-connection-tracking.html#untracked-connectionsl>`__.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type Direction: string
  :param Direction: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specify the applicable value:

     

    
    * ``INBOUND``: Resolver forwards DNS queries to the DNS service for a VPC from your network.
     
    * ``OUTBOUND``: Resolver forwards DNS queries from the DNS service for a VPC to your network.
     
    * ``INBOUND_DELEGATION``: Resolver delegates queries to Route 53 private hosted zones from your network.
    

    

  
  :type IpAddresses: list
  :param IpAddresses: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The subnets and IP addresses in your VPC that DNS queries originate from (for outbound endpoints) or that you forward DNS queries to (for inbound endpoints). The subnet ID uniquely identifies a VPC.

     

    .. note::

      

      Even though the minimum is 1, Route 53 requires that you create at least two.

      

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      In a `CreateResolverEndpoint <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_CreateResolverEndpoint.html>`__ request, the IP address that DNS queries originate from (for outbound endpoints) or that you forward DNS queries to (for inbound endpoints). ``IpAddressRequest`` also includes the ID of the subnet that contains the IP address.

      

    
      - **SubnetId** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The ID of the subnet that contains the IP address.

        

      
      - **Ip** *(string) --* 

        The IPv4 address that you want to use for DNS queries.

        

      
      - **Ipv6** *(string) --* 

        The IPv6 address that you want to use for DNS queries.

        

      
    

  :type OutpostArn: string
  :param OutpostArn: 

    The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Outpost. If you specify this, you must also specify a value for the ``PreferredInstanceType``.

    

  
  :type PreferredInstanceType: string
  :param PreferredInstanceType: 

    The instance type. If you specify this, you must also specify a value for the ``OutpostArn``.

    

  
  :type Tags: list
  :param Tags: 

    A list of the tag keys and values that you want to associate with the endpoint.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      One tag that you want to add to the specified resource. A tag consists of a ``Key`` (a name for the tag) and a ``Value``.

      

    
      - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The name for the tag. For example, if you want to associate Resolver resources with the account IDs of your customers for billing purposes, the value of ``Key`` might be ``account-id``.

        

      
      - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The value for the tag. For example, if ``Key`` is ``account-id``, then ``Value`` might be the ID of the customer account that you're creating the resource for.

        

      
    

  :type ResolverEndpointType: string
  :param ResolverEndpointType: 

    For the endpoint type you can choose either IPv4, IPv6, or dual-stack. A dual-stack endpoint means that it will resolve via both IPv4 and IPv6. This endpoint type is applied to all IP addresses.

    

  
  :type Protocols: list
  :param Protocols: 

    The protocols you want to use for the endpoint. DoH-FIPS is applicable for default inbound endpoints only.

     

    For a default inbound endpoint you can apply the protocols as follows:

     

    
    * Do53 and DoH in combination.
     
    * Do53 and DoH-FIPS in combination.
     
    * Do53 alone.
     
    * DoH alone.
     
    * DoH-FIPS alone.
     
    * None, which is treated as Do53.
    

     

    For a delegation inbound endpoint you can use Do53 only.

     

    For an outbound endpoint you can apply the protocols as follows:

     

    
    * Do53 and DoH in combination.
     
    * Do53 alone.
     
    * DoH alone.
     
    * None, which is treated as Do53.
    

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type RniEnhancedMetricsEnabled: boolean
  :param RniEnhancedMetricsEnabled: 

    Specifies whether RNI enhanced metrics are enabled for the Resolver endpoints. When set to true, one-minute granular metrics are published in CloudWatch for each RNI associated with this endpoint. When set to false, metrics are not published. Default is false.

     

    .. note::

      

      Standard CloudWatch pricing and charges are applied for using the Route 53 Resolver endpoint RNI enhanced metrics. For more information, see `Detailed metrics <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/monitoring-resolver-with-cloudwatch.html>`__.

      

    

  
  :type TargetNameServerMetricsEnabled: boolean
  :param TargetNameServerMetricsEnabled: 

    Specifies whether target name server metrics are enabled for the outbound Resolver endpoints. When set to true, one-minute granular metrics are published in CloudWatch for each target name server associated with this endpoint. When set to false, metrics are not published. Default is false. This is not supported for inbound Resolver endpoints.

     

    .. note::

      

      Standard CloudWatch pricing and charges are applied for using the Route 53 Resolver endpoint target name server metrics. For more information, see `Detailed metrics <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/monitoring-resolver-with-cloudwatch.html>`__.

          The name that you assigned to the Resolver endpoint when you submitted a `CreateResolverEndpoint <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_CreateResolverEndpoint.html>`__ request.

          
        

        - **SecurityGroupIds** *(list) --* 

          The ID of one or more security groups that control access to this VPC. The security group must include one or more inbound rules (for inbound endpoints) or outbound rules (for outbound endpoints). Inbound and outbound rules must allow TCP and UDP access. For inbound access, open port 53. For outbound access, open the port that you're using for DNS queries on your network.

          
          

          - *(string) --* 
      
        

        - **Direction** *(string) --* 

          Indicates whether the Resolver endpoint allows inbound or outbound DNS queries:

           

          
          * ``INBOUND``: allows DNS queries to your VPC from your network
           
          * ``OUTBOUND``: allows DNS queries from your VPC to your network
           
          * ``INBOUND_DELEGATION``: Resolver delegates queries to Route 53 private hosted zones from your network.
          

          
        

        - **IpAddressCount** *(integer) --* 

          The number of IP addresses that the Resolver endpoint can use for DNS queries.

          
        

        - **HostVPCId** *(string) --* 

          The ID of the VPC that you want to create the Resolver endpoint in.

          
        

        - **Status** *(string) --* 

          A code that specifies the current status of the Resolver endpoint. Valid values include the following:

           

          
          * ``CREATING``: Resolver is creating and configuring one or more Amazon VPC network interfaces for this endpoint.
           
          * ``OPERATIONAL``: The Amazon VPC network interfaces for this endpoint are correctly configured and able to pass inbound or outbound DNS queries between your network and Resolver.
           
          * ``UPDATING``: Resolver is associating or disassociating one or more network interfaces with this endpoint.
           
          * ``AUTO_RECOVERING``: Resolver is trying to recover one or more of the network interfaces that are associated with this endpoint. During the recovery process, the endpoint functions with limited capacity because of the limit on the number of DNS queries per IP address (per network interface). For the current limit, see `Limits on Route 53 Resolver <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/DNSLimitations.html#limits-api-entities-resolver>`__.
           
          * ``ACTION_NEEDED``: This endpoint is unhealthy, and Resolver can't automatically recover it. To resolve the problem, we recommend that you check each IP address that you associated with the endpoint. For each IP address that isn't available, add another IP address and then delete the IP address that isn't available. (An endpoint must always include at least two IP addresses.) A status of ``ACTION_NEEDED`` can have a variety of causes. Here are two common causes: 

            
            * One or more of the network interfaces that are associated with the endpoint were deleted using Amazon VPC.
             
            * The network interface couldn't be created for some reason that's outside the control of Resolver.
            

          
           
          * ``DELETING``: Resolver is deleting this endpoint and the associated network interfaces.
          

          
        

        - **StatusMessage** *(string) --* 

          A detailed description of the status of the Resolver endpoint.

          
        

        - **CreationTime** *(string) --* 

          The date and time that the endpoint was created, in Unix time format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

          
        

        - **ModificationTime** *(string) --* 

          The date and time that the endpoint was last modified, in Unix time format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

          
        

        - **OutpostArn** *(string) --* 

          The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) for the Outpost.

          
        

        - **PreferredInstanceType** *(string) --* 

          The Amazon EC2 instance type.

        - **Protocols** *(list) --* 

          Protocols used for the endpoint. DoH-FIPS is applicable for a default inbound endpoints only.

           

          For an inbound endpoint you can apply the protocols as follows:

           

          
          * Do53 and DoH in combination.

          * DoH-FIPS alone.
           
          * None, which is treated as Do53.
          

           

          For a delegation inbound endpoint you can use Do53 only.

           

          For an outbound endpoint you can apply the protocols as follows:

           

          
          * Do53 and DoH in combination.

        - **RniEnhancedMetricsEnabled** *(boolean) --* 

          Indicates whether RNI enhanced metrics are enabled for the Resolver endpoint. When enabled, one-minute granular metrics are published in CloudWatch for each RNI associated with this endpoint. When disabled, these metrics are not published.

          
        

        - **TargetNameServerMetricsEnabled** *(boolean) --* 

          Indicates whether target name server metrics are enabled for the outbound Resolver endpoint. When enabled, one-minute granular metrics are published in CloudWatch for each target name server associated with this endpoint. When disabled, these metrics are not published. This feature is not supported for inbound Resolver endpoint.
