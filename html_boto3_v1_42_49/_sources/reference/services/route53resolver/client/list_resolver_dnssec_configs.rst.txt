  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_resolver_dnssec_configs(
        MaxResults=123,
        NextToken='string',
        Filters=[
            {
                'Name': 'string',
                'Values': [
                    'string',
                ]
            },
        ]
    )
    
  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    *Optional*: An integer that specifies the maximum number of DNSSEC configuration results that you want Amazon Route 53 to return. If you don't specify a value for ``MaxResults``, Route 53 returns up to 100 configuration per page.

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    (Optional) If the current Amazon Web Services account has more than ``MaxResults`` DNSSEC configurations, use ``NextToken`` to get the second and subsequent pages of results.

     

    For the first ``ListResolverDnssecConfigs`` request, omit this value.

     

    For the second and subsequent requests, get the value of ``NextToken`` from the previous response and specify that value for ``NextToken`` in the request.

    

  
  :type Filters: list
  :param Filters: 

    An optional specification to return a subset of objects.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      For Resolver list operations ( `ListResolverEndpoints <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverEndpoints.html>`__, `ListResolverRules <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverRules.html>`__, `ListResolverRuleAssociations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverRuleAssociations.html>`__, `ListResolverQueryLogConfigs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverQueryLogConfigs.html>`__, `ListResolverQueryLogConfigAssociations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverQueryLogConfigAssociations.html>`__), and `ListResolverDnssecConfigs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverDnssecConfigs.html>`__), an optional specification to return a subset of objects.

       

      To filter objects, such as Resolver endpoints or Resolver rules, you specify ``Name`` and ``Values``. For example, to list only inbound Resolver endpoints, specify ``Direction`` for ``Name`` and specify ``INBOUND`` for ``Values``.

      

    
      - **Name** *(string) --* 

        The name of the parameter that you want to use to filter objects.

         

        The valid values for ``Name`` depend on the action that you're including the filter in, `ListResolverEndpoints <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverEndpoints.html>`__, `ListResolverRules <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverRules.html>`__, `ListResolverRuleAssociations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverRuleAssociations.html>`__, `ListResolverQueryLogConfigs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverQueryLogConfigs.html>`__, or `ListResolverQueryLogConfigAssociations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverQueryLogConfigAssociations.html>`__.

         

        .. note::

          

          In early versions of Resolver, values for ``Name`` were listed as uppercase, with underscore (_) delimiters. For example, ``CreatorRequestId`` was originally listed as ``CREATOR_REQUEST_ID``. Uppercase values for ``Name`` are still supported.

          

         

        **ListResolverEndpoints**

         

        Valid values for ``Name`` include the following:

         

        
        * ``CreatorRequestId``: The value that you specified when you created the Resolver endpoint.
         
        * ``Direction``: Whether you want to return inbound or outbound Resolver endpoints. If you specify ``DIRECTION`` for ``Name``, specify ``INBOUND`` or ``OUTBOUND`` for ``Values``.
         
        * ``HostVPCId``: The ID of the VPC that inbound DNS queries pass through on the way from your network to your VPCs in a region, or the VPC that outbound queries pass through on the way from your VPCs to your network. In a `CreateResolverEndpoint <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_CreateResolverEndpoint.html>`__ request, ``SubnetId`` indirectly identifies the VPC. In a `GetResolverEndpoint <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_GetResolverEndpoint.html>`__ request, the VPC ID for a Resolver endpoint is returned in the ``HostVPCId`` element.
         
        * ``IpAddressCount``: The number of IP addresses that you have associated with the Resolver endpoint.
         
        * ``Name``: The name of the Resolver endpoint.
         
        * ``SecurityGroupIds``: The IDs of the VPC security groups that you specified when you created the Resolver endpoint.
         
        * ``Status``: The status of the Resolver endpoint. If you specify ``Status`` for ``Name``, specify one of the following status codes for ``Values``: ``CREATING``, ``OPERATIONAL``, ``UPDATING``, ``AUTO_RECOVERING``, ``ACTION_NEEDED``, or ``DELETING``. For more information, see ``Status`` in `ResolverEndpoint <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ResolverEndpoint.html>`__.
        

         

        **ListResolverRules**

         

        Valid values for ``Name`` include the following:

         

        
        * ``CreatorRequestId``: The value that you specified when you created the Resolver rule.
         
        * ``DomainName``: The domain name for which Resolver is forwarding DNS queries to your network. In the value that you specify for ``Values``, include a trailing dot (.) after the domain name. For example, if the domain name is example.com, specify the following value. Note the "." after ``com``: ``example.com.``
         
        * ``Name``: The name of the Resolver rule.
         
        * ``ResolverEndpointId``: The ID of the Resolver endpoint that the Resolver rule is associated with. 

        .. note::

          You can filter on the Resolver endpoint only for rules that have a value of ``FORWARD`` for ``RuleType``.

        
         
        * ``Status``: The status of the Resolver rule. If you specify ``Status`` for ``Name``, specify one of the following status codes for ``Values``: ``COMPLETE``, ``DELETING``, ``UPDATING``, or ``FAILED``.
         
        * ``Type``: The type of the Resolver rule. If you specify ``TYPE`` for ``Name``, specify ``FORWARD`` or ``SYSTEM`` for ``Values``.
        

         

        **ListResolverRuleAssociations**

         

        Valid values for ``Name`` include the following:
