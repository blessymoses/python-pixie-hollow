  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_resolver_rules(
        MaxResults=123,
        NextToken='string',
        Filters=[
            {
                'Name': 'string',
                'Values': [
                    'string',
                ]
            },
        ]
    )
    
  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    The maximum number of Resolver rules that you want to return in the response to a ``ListResolverRules`` request. If you don't specify a value for ``MaxResults``, Resolver returns up to 100 Resolver rules.

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    For the first ``ListResolverRules`` request, omit this value.

     

    If you have more than ``MaxResults`` Resolver rules, you can submit another ``ListResolverRules`` request to get the next group of Resolver rules. In the next request, specify the value of ``NextToken`` from the previous response.

    

  
  :type Filters: list
  :param Filters: 

    An optional specification to return a subset of Resolver rules, such as all Resolver rules that are associated with the same Resolver endpoint.

     

    .. note::

      

      If you submit a second or subsequent ``ListResolverRules`` request and specify the ``NextToken`` parameter, you must use the same values for ``Filters``, if any, as in the previous request.

      

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      For Resolver list operations ( `ListResolverEndpoints <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverEndpoints.html>`__, `ListResolverRules <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverRules.html>`__, `ListResolverRuleAssociations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverRuleAssociations.html>`__, `ListResolverQueryLogConfigs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverQueryLogConfigs.html>`__, `ListResolverQueryLogConfigAssociations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverQueryLogConfigAssociations.html>`__), and `ListResolverDnssecConfigs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverDnssecConfigs.html>`__), an optional specification to return a subset of objects.

       

      To filter objects, such as Resolver endpoints or Resolver rules, you specify ``Name`` and ``Values``. For example, to list only inbound Resolver endpoints, specify ``Direction`` for ``Name`` and specify ``INBOUND`` for ``Values``.

      

    
      - **Name** *(string) --* 

        The name of the parameter that you want to use to filter objects.

         

        The valid values for ``Name`` depend on the action that you're including the filter in, `ListResolverEndpoints <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverEndpoints.html>`__, `ListResolverRules <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverRules.html>`__, `ListResolverRuleAssociations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverRuleAssociations.html>`__, `ListResolverQueryLogConfigs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverQueryLogConfigs.html>`__, or `ListResolverQueryLogConfigAssociations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverQueryLogConfigAssociations.html>`__.

         

        .. note::

          

          In early versions of Resolver, values for ``Name`` were listed as uppercase, with underscore (_) delimiters. For example, ``CreatorRequestId`` was originally listed as ``CREATOR_REQUEST_ID``. Uppercase values for ``Name`` are still supported.

          

         

        **ListResolverEndpoints**

         

        Valid values for ``Name`` include the following:

         

        
        * ``CreatorRequestId``: The value that you specified when you created the Resolver endpoint.
         
        * ``Direction``: Whether you want to return inbound or outbound Resolver endpoints. If you specify ``DIRECTION`` for ``Name``, specify ``INBOUND`` or ``OUTBOUND`` for ``Values``.
         
        * ``HostVPCId``: The ID of the VPC that inbound DNS queries pass through on the way from your network to your VPCs in a region, or the VPC that outbound queries pass through on the way from your VPCs to your network. In a `CreateResolverEndpoint <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_CreateResolverEndpoint.html>`__ request, ``SubnetId`` indirectly identifies the VPC. In a `GetResolverEndpoint <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_GetResolverEndpoint.html>`__ request, the VPC ID for a Resolver endpoint is returned in the ``HostVPCId`` element.
         
        * ``IpAddressCount``: The number of IP addresses that you have associated with the Resolver endpoint.
         
        * ``Name``: The name of the Resolver endpoint.
         
        * ``SecurityGroupIds``: The IDs of the VPC security groups that you specified when you created the Resolver endpoint.
         
        * ``Status``: The status of the Resolver endpoint. If you specify ``Status`` for ``Name``, specify one of the following status codes for ``Values``: ``CREATING``, ``OPERATIONAL``, ``UPDATING``, ``AUTO_RECOVERING``, ``ACTION_NEEDED``, or ``DELETING``. For more information, see ``Status`` in `ResolverEndpoint <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ResolverEndpoint.html>`__.
        

         

        **ListResolverRules**

         

        Valid values for ``Name`` include the following:

         

        
        * ``CreatorRequestId``: The value that you specified when you created the Resolver rule.
         
        * ``DomainName``: The domain name for which Resolver is forwarding DNS queries to your network. In the value that you specify for ``Values``, include a trailing dot (.) after the domain name. For example, if the domain name is example.com, specify the following value. Note the "." after ``com``: ``example.com.``
         
        * ``Name``: The name of the Resolver rule.
         
        * ``ResolverEndpointId``: The ID of the Resolver endpoint that the Resolver rule is associated with. 

        .. note::

          You can filter on the Resolver endpoint only for rules that have a value of ``FORWARD`` for ``RuleType``.

        
         
        * ``Status``: The status of the Resolver rule. If you specify ``Status`` for ``Name``, specify one of the following status codes for ``Values``: ``COMPLETE``, ``DELETING``, ``UPDATING``, or ``FAILED``.
         
        * ``Type``: The type of the Resolver rule. If you specify ``TYPE`` for ``Name``, specify ``FORWARD`` or ``SYSTEM`` for ``Values``.
        

         

        **ListResolverRuleAssociations**

         

        Valid values for ``Name`` include the following:

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

        If more than ``MaxResults`` Resolver rules match the specified criteria, you can submit another ``ListResolverRules`` request to get the next group of results. In the next request, specify the value of ``NextToken`` from the previous response.

        
      

      - **MaxResults** *(integer) --* 

        The value that you specified for ``MaxResults`` in the request.

        
      

      - **ResolverRules** *(list) --* 

        The Resolver rules that were created using the current Amazon Web Services account and that match the specified filters, if any.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          For queries that originate in your VPC, detailed information about a Resolver rule, which specifies how to route DNS queries out of the VPC. The ``ResolverRule`` parameter appears in the response to a `CreateResolverRule <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_CreateResolverRule.html>`__, `DeleteResolverRule <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_DeleteResolverRule.html>`__, `GetResolverRule <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_GetResolverRule.html>`__, `ListResolverRules <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverRules.html>`__, or `UpdateResolverRule <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_UpdateResolverRule.html>`__ request.

          
          

          - **Id** *(string) --* 

            The ID that Resolver assigned to the Resolver rule when you created it.

            
          

          - **CreatorRequestId** *(string) --* 

            A unique string that you specified when you created the Resolver rule. ``CreatorRequestId`` identifies the request and allows failed requests to be retried without the risk of running the operation twice.

            
          

          - **Arn** *(string) --* 

            The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) for the Resolver rule specified by ``Id``.

            
          

          - **DomainName** *(string) --* 

            DNS queries for this domain name are forwarded to the IP addresses that are specified in ``TargetIps``. If a query matches multiple Resolver rules (example.com and www.example.com), the query is routed using the Resolver rule that contains the most specific domain name (www.example.com).

            
          

          - **Status** *(string) --* 

            A code that specifies the current status of the Resolver rule.

            
          

          - **StatusMessage** *(string) --* 

            A detailed description of the status of a Resolver rule.

            
          

          - **RuleType** *(string) --* 

            When you want to forward DNS queries for specified domain name to resolvers on your network, specify ``FORWARD`` or ``DELEGATE``. If a query matches multiple Resolver rules (example.com and www.example.com), outbound DNS queries are routed using the Resolver rule that contains the most specific domain name (www.example.com).

             

            When you have a forwarding rule to forward DNS queries for a domain to your network and you want Resolver to process queries for a subdomain of that domain, specify ``SYSTEM``.

             

            For example, to forward DNS queries for example.com to resolvers on your network, you create a rule and specify ``FORWARD`` for ``RuleType``. To then have Resolver process queries for apex.example.com, you create a rule and specify ``SYSTEM`` for ``RuleType``.

             

            Currently, only Resolver can create rules that have a value of ``RECURSIVE`` for ``RuleType``.

            
          

          - **Name** *(string) --* 

            The name for the Resolver rule, which you specified when you created the Resolver rule.

             

            The name can be up to 64 characters long and can contain letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), hyphens (-), underscores (_), and spaces. The name cannot consist of only numbers.

            
          

          - **TargetIps** *(list) --* 

            An array that contains the IP addresses and ports that an outbound endpoint forwards DNS queries to. Typically, these are the IP addresses of DNS resolvers on your network.

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

              In a `CreateResolverRule <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_CreateResolverRule.html>`__ request, an array of the IPs that you want to forward DNS queries to.

              
              

              - **Ip** *(string) --* 

                One IPv4 address that you want to forward DNS queries to.

                
              

              - **Port** *(integer) --* 

                The port at ``Ip`` that you want to forward DNS queries to.

                
              

              - **Ipv6** *(string) --* 

                One IPv6 address that you want to forward DNS queries to.

                
              

              - **Protocol** *(string) --* 

                The protocols for the target address. The protocol you choose needs to be supported by the outbound endpoint of the Resolver rule.

                
              

              - **ServerNameIndication** *(string) --* 

                The Server Name Indication of the DoH server that you want to forward queries to. This is only used if the Protocol of the ``TargetAddress`` is ``DoH``.

                
          
        
          

          - **ResolverEndpointId** *(string) --* 

            The ID of the endpoint that the rule is associated with.

            
          

          - **OwnerId** *(string) --* 

            When a rule is shared with another Amazon Web Services account, the account ID of the account that the rule is shared with.

            
          

          - **ShareStatus** *(string) --* 

            Whether the rule is shared and, if so, whether the current account is sharing the rule with another account, or another account is sharing the rule with the current account.

            
          

          - **CreationTime** *(string) --* 

            The date and time that the Resolver rule was created, in Unix time format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

            
          

          - **ModificationTime** *(string) --* 

            The date and time that the Resolver rule was last updated, in Unix time format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

            
          

          - **DelegationRecord** *(string) --* 

            DNS queries with delegation records that point to this domain name are forwarded to resolvers on your network.
