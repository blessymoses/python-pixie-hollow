.. py:method:: Route53Resolver.Client.list_firewall_rule_group_associations(**kwargs)

  

  Retrieves the firewall rule group associations that you have defined. Each association enables DNS filtering for a VPC with one rule group.

   

  A single call might return only a partial list of the associations. For information, see ``MaxResults``.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_firewall_rule_group_associations(
        FirewallRuleGroupId='string',
        VpcId='string',
        Priority=123,
        Status='COMPLETE'|'DELETING'|'UPDATING',
        MaxResults=123,
        NextToken='string'
    )
    
  :type FirewallRuleGroupId: string
  :param FirewallRuleGroupId: 

    The unique identifier of the firewall rule group that you want to retrieve the associations for. Leave this blank to retrieve associations for any rule group.

    

  
  :type VpcId: string
  :param VpcId: 

    The unique identifier of the VPC that you want to retrieve the associations for. Leave this blank to retrieve associations for any VPC.

    

  
  :type Priority: integer
  :param Priority: 

    The setting that determines the processing order of the rule group among the rule groups that are associated with a single VPC. DNS Firewall filters VPC traffic starting from the rule group with the lowest numeric priority setting.

    

  
  :type Status: string
  :param Status: 

    The association ``Status`` setting that you want DNS Firewall to filter on for the list. If you don't specify this, then DNS Firewall returns all associations, regardless of status.

    

  
  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    The maximum number of objects that you want Resolver to return for this request. If more objects are available, in the response, Resolver provides a ``NextToken`` value that you can use in a subsequent call to get the next batch of objects.

     

    If you don't specify a value for ``MaxResults``, Resolver returns up to 100 objects.

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    For the first call to this list request, omit this value.

     

    When you request a list of objects, Resolver returns at most the number of objects specified in ``MaxResults``. If more objects are available for retrieval, Resolver returns a ``NextToken`` value in the response. To retrieve the next batch of objects, use the token that was returned for the prior request in your next request.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

        If objects are still available for retrieval, Resolver returns this token in the response. To retrieve the next batch of objects, provide this token in your next request.

        
      

      - **FirewallRuleGroupAssociations** *(list) --* 

        A list of your firewall rule group associations.

         

        This might be a partial list of the associations that you have defined. For information, see ``MaxResults``.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          An association between a firewall rule group and a VPC, which enables DNS filtering for the VPC.

          
          

          - **Id** *(string) --* 

            The identifier for the association.

            
          

          - **Arn** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall rule group association.

            
          

          - **FirewallRuleGroupId** *(string) --* 

            The unique identifier of the firewall rule group.

            
          

          - **VpcId** *(string) --* 

            The unique identifier of the VPC that is associated with the rule group.

            
          

          - **Name** *(string) --* 

            The name of the association.

            
          

          - **Priority** *(integer) --* 

            The setting that determines the processing order of the rule group among the rule groups that are associated with a single VPC. DNS Firewall filters VPC traffic starting from rule group with the lowest numeric priority setting.

            
          

          - **MutationProtection** *(string) --* 

            If enabled, this setting disallows modification or removal of the association, to help prevent against accidentally altering DNS firewall protections.

            
          

          - **ManagedOwnerName** *(string) --* 

            The owner of the association, used only for associations that are not managed by you. If you use Firewall Manager to manage your DNS Firewalls, then this reports Firewall Manager as the managed owner.

            
          

          - **Status** *(string) --* 

            The current status of the association.

            Additional information about the status of the response, if available.

            
          

          - **CreatorRequestId** *(string) --* 

            A unique string defined by you to identify the request. This allows you to retry failed requests without the risk of running the operation twice. This can be any unique string, for example, a timestamp.

            
          

          - **CreationTime** *(string) --* 

            The date and time that the association was created, in Unix time format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

            
          

          - **ModificationTime** *(string) --* 

            The date and time that the association was last modified, in Unix time format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
