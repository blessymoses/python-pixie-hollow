    )
    
  :type ResolverEndpointId: string
  :param ResolverEndpointId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ID of the Resolver endpoint that you want to update.

    

  
  :type Name: string
  :param Name: 

    The name of the Resolver endpoint that you want to update.

    

  
  :type ResolverEndpointType: string
  :param ResolverEndpointType: 

    Specifies the endpoint type for what type of IP address the endpoint uses to forward DNS queries.

     

    Updating to ``IPV6`` type isn't currently supported.

    

  
  :type UpdateIpAddresses: list
  :param UpdateIpAddresses: 

    Specifies the IPv6 address when you update the Resolver endpoint from IPv4 to dual-stack. If you don't specify an IPv6 address, one will be automatically chosen from your subnet.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      Provides information about the IP address type in response to `UpdateResolverEndpoint <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_UpdateResolverEndpoint.html>`__.

      

    
      - **IpId** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The ID of the IP address, specified by the ``ResolverEndpointId``.

        

      
      - **Ipv6** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The IPv6 address that you want to use for DNS queries.

        

      
    

  :type Protocols: list
  :param Protocols: 

    The protocols you want to use for the endpoint. DoH-FIPS is applicable for default inbound endpoints only.

     

    For a default inbound endpoint you can apply the protocols as follows:

     

    
    * Do53 and DoH in combination.
     
    * Do53 and DoH-FIPS in combination.
     
    * Do53 alone.
     
    * DoH alone.
     
    * DoH-FIPS alone.
     
    * None, which is treated as Do53.
    

     

    For a delegation inbound endpoint you can use Do53 only.

     

    For an outbound endpoint you can apply the protocols as follows:

     

    
    * Do53 and DoH in combination.
     
    * Do53 alone.
     
    * DoH alone.
     
    * None, which is treated as Do53.
    

     

    .. warning::

       

      You can't change the protocol of an inbound endpoint directly from only Do53 to only DoH, or DoH-FIPS. This is to prevent a sudden disruption to incoming traffic that relies on Do53. To change the protocol from Do53 to DoH, or DoH-FIPS, you must first enable both Do53 and DoH, or Do53 and DoH-FIPS, to make sure that all incoming traffic has transferred to using the DoH protocol, or DoH-FIPS, and then remove the Do53.

      

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type RniEnhancedMetricsEnabled: boolean
  :param RniEnhancedMetricsEnabled: 

    Updates whether RNI enhanced metrics are enabled for the Resolver endpoints. When set to true, one-minute granular metrics are published in CloudWatch for each RNI associated with this endpoint. When set to false, metrics are not published.

     

    .. note::

      

      Standard CloudWatch pricing and charges are applied for using the Route 53 Resolver endpoint RNI enhanced metrics. For more information, see `Detailed metrics <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/monitoring-resolver-with-cloudwatch.html>`__.

      

    

  
  :type TargetNameServerMetricsEnabled: boolean
  :param TargetNameServerMetricsEnabled: 

    Updates whether target name server metrics are enabled for the outbound Resolver endpoints. When set to true, one-minute granular metrics are published in CloudWatch for each target name server associated with this endpoint. When set to false, metrics are not published. This setting is not supported for inbound Resolver endpoints.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **ResolverEndpoint** *(dict) --* 

        The response to an ``UpdateResolverEndpoint`` request.

        
        

        - **Id** *(string) --* 

          The ID of the Resolver endpoint.

          
        

        - **CreatorRequestId** *(string) --* 

          A unique string that identifies the request that created the Resolver endpoint. The ``CreatorRequestId`` allows failed requests to be retried without the risk of running the operation twice.

          
        

        - **Arn** *(string) --* 

          The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) for the Resolver endpoint.

          
        

        - **Name** *(string) --* 

          The name that you assigned to the Resolver endpoint when you submitted a `CreateResolverEndpoint <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_CreateResolverEndpoint.html>`__ request.

          
        

        - **SecurityGroupIds** *(list) --* 

          The ID of one or more security groups that control access to this VPC. The security group must include one or more inbound rules (for inbound endpoints) or outbound rules (for outbound endpoints). Inbound and outbound rules must allow TCP and UDP access. For inbound access, open port 53. For outbound access, open the port that you're using for DNS queries on your network.

          
          

          - *(string) --* 
      
        

        - **Direction** *(string) --* 

          Indicates whether the Resolver endpoint allows inbound or outbound DNS queries:

           

          
          * ``INBOUND``: allows DNS queries to your VPC from your network
           
          * ``OUTBOUND``: allows DNS queries from your VPC to your network
           
          * ``INBOUND_DELEGATION``: Resolver delegates queries to Route 53 private hosted zones from your network.
          

          
        

        - **IpAddressCount** *(integer) --* 

          The number of IP addresses that the Resolver endpoint can use for DNS queries.

          
        

        - **HostVPCId** *(string) --* 

          The ID of the VPC that you want to create the Resolver endpoint in.

          
        

        - **Status** *(string) --* 

          A code that specifies the current status of the Resolver endpoint. Valid values include the following:

           

          
          * ``CREATING``: Resolver is creating and configuring one or more Amazon VPC network interfaces for this endpoint.
           
          * ``OPERATIONAL``: The Amazon VPC network interfaces for this endpoint are correctly configured and able to pass inbound or outbound DNS queries between your network and Resolver.
           
          * ``UPDATING``: Resolver is associating or disassociating one or more network interfaces with this endpoint.
           
          * ``AUTO_RECOVERING``: Resolver is trying to recover one or more of the network interfaces that are associated with this endpoint. During the recovery process, the endpoint functions with limited capacity because of the limit on the number of DNS queries per IP address (per network interface). For the current limit, see `Limits on Route 53 Resolver <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/DNSLimitations.html#limits-api-entities-resolver>`__.
           
          * ``ACTION_NEEDED``: This endpoint is unhealthy, and Resolver can't automatically recover it. To resolve the problem, we recommend that you check each IP address that you associated with the endpoint. For each IP address that isn't available, add another IP address and then delete the IP address that isn't available. (An endpoint must always include at least two IP addresses.) A status of ``ACTION_NEEDED`` can have a variety of causes. Here are two common causes: 

            
            * One or more of the network interfaces that are associated with the endpoint were deleted using Amazon VPC.
             
            * The network interface couldn't be created for some reason that's outside the control of Resolver.
            

          
           
          * ``DELETING``: Resolver is deleting this endpoint and the associated network interfaces.
          

          
        

        - **StatusMessage** *(string) --*

        - **RniEnhancedMetricsEnabled** *(boolean) --* 

          Indicates whether RNI enhanced metrics are enabled for the Resolver endpoint. When enabled, one-minute granular metrics are published in CloudWatch for each RNI associated with this endpoint. When disabled, these metrics are not published.

          
        

        - **TargetNameServerMetricsEnabled** *(boolean) --* 

          Indicates whether target name server metrics are enabled for the outbound Resolver endpoint. When enabled, one-minute granular metrics are published in CloudWatch for each target name server associated with this endpoint. When disabled, these metrics are not published. This feature is not supported for inbound Resolver endpoint.
