.. py:method:: Route53Resolver.Client.list_resolver_query_log_configs(**kwargs)

  

  Lists information about the specified query logging configurations. Each configuration defines where you want Resolver to save DNS query logs and specifies the VPCs that you want to log queries for.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_resolver_query_log_configs(
        MaxResults=123,
        NextToken='string',
        Filters=[
            {
                'Name': 'string',
                'Values': [
                    'string',
                ]
            },
        ],
        SortBy='string',
        SortOrder='ASCENDING'|'DESCENDING'
    )
    
  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    The maximum number of query logging configurations that you want to return in the response to a ``ListResolverQueryLogConfigs`` request. If you don't specify a value for ``MaxResults``, Resolver returns up to 100 query logging configurations.

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    For the first ``ListResolverQueryLogConfigs`` request, omit this value.

     

    If there are more than ``MaxResults`` query logging configurations that match the values that you specify for ``Filters``, you can submit another ``ListResolverQueryLogConfigs`` request to get the next group of configurations. In the next request, specify the value of ``NextToken`` from the previous response.

    

  
  :type Filters: list
  :param Filters: 

    An optional specification to return a subset of query logging configurations.

     

    .. note::

      

      If you submit a second or subsequent ``ListResolverQueryLogConfigs`` request and specify the ``NextToken`` parameter, you must use the same values for ``Filters``, if any, as in the previous request.

      

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      For Resolver list operations ( `ListResolverEndpoints <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverEndpoints.html>`__, `ListResolverRules <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverRules.html>`__, `ListResolverRuleAssociations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverRuleAssociations.html>`__, `ListResolverQueryLogConfigs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverQueryLogConfigs.html>`__, `ListResolverQueryLogConfigAssociations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverQueryLogConfigAssociations.html>`__), and `ListResolverDnssecConfigs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverDnssecConfigs.html>`__), an optional specification to return a subset of objects.

       

      To filter objects, such as Resolver endpoints or Resolver rules, you specify ``Name`` and ``Values``. For example, to list only inbound Resolver endpoints, specify ``Direction`` for ``Name`` and specify ``INBOUND`` for ``Values``.

      

    
      - **Name** *(string) --* 

        The name of the parameter that you want to use to filter objects.

         

        The valid values for ``Name`` depend on the action that you're including the filter in, `ListResolverEndpoints <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverEndpoints.html>`__, `ListResolverRules <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverRules.html>`__, `ListResolverRuleAssociations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverRuleAssociations.html>`__, `ListResolverQueryLogConfigs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverQueryLogConfigs.html>`__, or `ListResolverQueryLogConfigAssociations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverQueryLogConfigAssociations.html>`__.

         

        .. note::

          

          In early versions of Resolver, values for ``Name`` were listed as uppercase, with underscore (_) delimiters. For example, ``CreatorRequestId`` was originally listed as ``CREATOR_REQUEST_ID``. Uppercase values for ``Name`` are still supported.

          

         

        **ListResolverEndpoints**

         

        Valid values for ``Name`` include the following:

         

        
        * ``CreatorRequestId``: The value that you specified when you created the Resolver endpoint.
         
        * ``Direction``: Whether you want to return inbound or outbound Resolver endpoints. If you specify ``DIRECTION`` for ``Name``, specify ``INBOUND`` or ``OUTBOUND`` for ``Values``.
         
        * ``HostVPCId``: The ID of the VPC that inbound DNS queries pass through on the way from your network to your VPCs in a region, or the VPC that outbound queries pass through on the way from your VPCs to your network. In a `CreateResolverEndpoint <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_CreateResolverEndpoint.html>`__ request, ``SubnetId`` indirectly identifies the VPC. In a `GetResolverEndpoint <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_GetResolverEndpoint.html>`__ request, the VPC ID for a Resolver endpoint is returned in the ``HostVPCId`` element.
         
        * ``IpAddressCount``: The number of IP addresses that you have associated with the Resolver endpoint.
         
        * ``Name``: The name of the Resolver endpoint.
         
        * ``SecurityGroupIds``: The IDs of the VPC security groups that you specified when you created the Resolver endpoint.
         
        * ``Status``: The status of the Resolver endpoint. If you specify ``Status`` for ``Name``, specify one of the following status codes for ``Values``: ``CREATING``, ``OPERATIONAL``, ``UPDATING``, ``AUTO_RECOVERING``, ``ACTION_NEEDED``, or ``DELETING``. For more information, see ``Status`` in `ResolverEndpoint <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ResolverEndpoint.html>`__.
        

         

        **ListResolverRules**

         

        Valid values for ``Name`` include the following:

         

        
        * ``CreatorRequestId``: The value that you specified when you created the Resolver rule.
         
        * ``DomainName``: The domain name for which Resolver is forwarding DNS queries to your network. In the value that you specify for ``Values``, include a trailing dot (.) after the domain name. For example, if the domain name is example.com, specify the following value. Note the "." after ``com``: ``example.com.``
         
        * ``Name``: The name of the Resolver rule.
         
        * ``ResolverEndpointId``: The ID of the Resolver endpoint that the Resolver rule is associated with. 

        .. note::

          You can filter on the Resolver endpoint only for rules that have a value of ``FORWARD`` for ``RuleType``.

        
         
        * ``Status``: The status of the Resolver rule. If you specify ``Status`` for ``Name``, specify one of the following status codes for ``Values``: ``COMPLETE``, ``DELETING``, ``UPDATING``, or ``FAILED``.
         
        * ``Type``: The type of the Resolver rule. If you specify ``TYPE`` for ``Name``, specify ``FORWARD`` or ``SYSTEM`` for ``Values``.
