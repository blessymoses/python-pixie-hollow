.. py:method:: Route53Resolver.Client.list_firewall_domain_lists(**kwargs)

  

  Retrieves the firewall domain lists that you have defined. For each firewall domain list, you can retrieve the domains that are defined for a list by calling  ListFirewallDomains.

   

  A single call to this list operation might return only a partial list of the domain lists. For information, see ``MaxResults``.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_firewall_domain_lists(
        MaxResults=123,
        NextToken='string'
    )
    
  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    The maximum number of objects that you want Resolver to return for this request. If more objects are available, in the response, Resolver provides a ``NextToken`` value that you can use in a subsequent call to get the next batch of objects.

     

    If you don't specify a value for ``MaxResults``, Resolver returns up to 100 objects.

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    For the first call to this list request, omit this value.

     

    When you request a list of objects, Resolver returns at most the number of objects specified in ``MaxResults``. If more objects are available for retrieval, Resolver returns a ``NextToken`` value in the response. To retrieve the next batch of objects, use the token that was returned for the prior request in your next request.

    **Response Syntax**

    
    ::

      {
          'NextToken': 'string',
          'FirewallDomainLists': [
              {
                  'Id': 'string',
                  'Arn': 'string',
                  'Name': 'string',
                  'CreatorRequestId': 'string',
                  'ManagedOwnerName': 'string'

      }
      
    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

        If objects are still available for retrieval, Resolver returns this token in the response. To retrieve the next batch of objects, provide this token in your next request.

        
      

      - **FirewallDomainLists** *(list) --* 

        A list of the domain lists that you have defined.

         

        This might be a partial list of the domain lists that you've defined. For information, see ``MaxResults``.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          Minimal high-level information for a firewall domain list. The action  ListFirewallDomainLists returns an array of these objects.

           

          To retrieve full information for a firewall domain list, call  GetFirewallDomainList and  ListFirewallDomains.

          
          

          - **Id** *(string) --* 

            The ID of the domain list.

            
          

          - **Arn** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the firewall domain list metadata.

            
          

          - **Name** *(string) --* 

            The name of the domain list.

            
          

          - **CreatorRequestId** *(string) --* 

            A unique string defined by you to identify the request. This allows you to retry failed requests without the risk of running the operation twice. This can be any unique string, for example, a timestamp.

            
          

          - **ManagedOwnerName** *(string) --* 

            The owner of the list, used only for lists that are not managed by you. For example, the managed domain list ``AWSManagedDomainsMalwareDomainList`` has the managed owner name ``Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall``.
