  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.create_resolver_rule(
        CreatorRequestId='string',
        Name='string',
        RuleType='FORWARD'|'SYSTEM'|'RECURSIVE'|'DELEGATE',
        DomainName='string',
        TargetIps=[
            {
                'Ip': 'string',
                'Port': 123,
                'Ipv6': 'string',
                'Protocol': 'DoH'|'Do53'|'DoH-FIPS',
                'ServerNameIndication': 'string'
            },
        ],
        ResolverEndpointId='string',
        Tags=[
            {
                'Key': 'string',
                'Value': 'string'
            },
        ],
        DelegationRecord='string'
    )
    
  :type CreatorRequestId: string
  :param CreatorRequestId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A unique string that identifies the request and that allows failed requests to be retried without the risk of running the operation twice. ``CreatorRequestId`` can be any unique string, for example, a date/time stamp.

    

  
  :type Name: string
  :param Name: 

    A friendly name that lets you easily find a rule in the Resolver dashboard in the Route 53 console.

     

    The name can be up to 64 characters long and can contain letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), hyphens (-), underscores (_), and spaces. The name cannot consist of only numbers.

    

  
  :type RuleType: string
  :param RuleType: **[REQUIRED]** 

    When you want to forward DNS queries for specified domain name to resolvers on your network, specify ``FORWARD`` or ``DELEGATE``.

     

    When you have a forwarding rule to forward DNS queries for a domain to your network and you want Resolver to process queries for a subdomain of that domain, specify ``SYSTEM``.

     

    For example, to forward DNS queries for example.com to resolvers on your network, you create a rule and specify ``FORWARD`` for ``RuleType``. To then have Resolver process queries for apex.example.com, you create a rule and specify ``SYSTEM`` for ``RuleType``.

     

    Currently, only Resolver can create rules that have a value of ``RECURSIVE`` for ``RuleType``.

    

  
  :type DomainName: string
  :param DomainName: 

    DNS queries for this domain name are forwarded to the IP addresses that you specify in ``TargetIps``. If a query matches multiple Resolver rules (example.com and www.example.com), outbound DNS queries are routed using the Resolver rule that contains the most specific domain name (www.example.com).

    

  
  :type TargetIps: list
  :param TargetIps: 

    The IPs that you want Resolver to forward DNS queries to. You can specify either Ipv4 or Ipv6 addresses but not both in the same rule. Separate IP addresses with a space.

     

    ``TargetIps`` is available only when the value of ``Rule type`` is ``FORWARD``. You should not provide TargetIps when the Rule type is ``DELEGATE``.

     

    .. note::

      

      when creating a DELEGATE rule, you must not provide the ``TargetIps`` parameter. If you provide the ``TargetIps``, you may receive an ERROR message similar to "Delegate resolver rules need to specify a nameserver name". This error means you should not provide ``TargetIps``.

      

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      In a `CreateResolverRule <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_CreateResolverRule.html>`__ request, an array of the IPs that you want to forward DNS queries to.

      

    
      - **Ip** *(string) --* 

        One IPv4 address that you want to forward DNS queries to.

        

      
      - **Port** *(integer) --* 

        The port at ``Ip`` that you want to forward DNS queries to.

        

      
      - **Ipv6** *(string) --* 

        One IPv6 address that you want to forward DNS queries to.

        

      
      - **Protocol** *(string) --* 

        The protocols for the target address. The protocol you choose needs to be supported by the outbound endpoint of the Resolver rule.

        

      
      - **ServerNameIndication** *(string) --* 

        The Server Name Indication of the DoH server that you want to forward queries to. This is only used if the Protocol of the ``TargetAddress`` is ``DoH``.

        

      
    

  :type ResolverEndpointId: string
  :param ResolverEndpointId: 

    The ID of the outbound Resolver endpoint that you want to use to route DNS queries to the IP addresses that you specify in ``TargetIps``.

    

  
  :type Tags: list
  :param Tags: 

    A list of the tag keys and values that you want to associate with the endpoint.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      One tag that you want to add to the specified resource. A tag consists of a ``Key`` (a name for the tag) and a ``Value``.

      

    
      - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The name for the tag. For example, if you want to associate Resolver resources with the account IDs of your customers for billing purposes, the value of ``Key`` might be ``account-id``.

        

      
      - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The value for the tag. For example, if ``Key`` is ``account-id``, then ``Value`` might be the ID of the customer account that you're creating the resource for.

        

      
    

  :type DelegationRecord: string
  :param DelegationRecord: 

    DNS queries with the delegation records that match this domain name are forwarded to the resolvers on your network.
