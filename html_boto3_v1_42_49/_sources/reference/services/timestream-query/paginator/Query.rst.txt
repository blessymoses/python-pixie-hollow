    **Request Syntax**
    ::

      response_iterator = paginator.paginate(
          QueryString='string',
          ClientToken='string',
          QueryInsights={
              'Mode': 'ENABLED_WITH_RATE_CONTROL'|'DISABLED'
          },
          PaginationConfig={
              'MaxItems': 123,
              'PageSize': 123,
              'StartingToken': 'string'
          }
      )
      
    :type QueryString: string
    :param QueryString: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The query to be run by Timestream.

      

    
    :type ClientToken: string
    :param ClientToken: 

      Unique, case-sensitive string of up to 64 ASCII characters specified when a ``Query`` request is made. Providing a ``ClientToken`` makes the call to ``Query`` *idempotent*. This means that running the same query repeatedly will produce the same result. In other words, making multiple identical ``Query`` requests has the same effect as making a single request. When using ``ClientToken`` in a query, note the following:

       

      
      * If the Query API is instantiated without a ``ClientToken``, the Query SDK generates a ``ClientToken`` on your behalf.
       
      * If the ``Query`` invocation only contains the ``ClientToken`` but does not include a ``NextToken``, that invocation of ``Query`` is assumed to be a new query run.
       
      * If the invocation contains ``NextToken``, that particular invocation is assumed to be a subsequent invocation of a prior call to the Query API, and a result set is returned.
       
      * After 4 hours, any request with the same ``ClientToken`` is treated as a new request.
      

      This field is autopopulated if not provided.

    
    :type QueryInsights: dict
    :param QueryInsights: 

      Encapsulates settings for enabling ``QueryInsights``.

       

      Enabling ``QueryInsights`` returns insights and metrics in addition to query results for the query that you executed. You can use ``QueryInsights`` to tune your query performance.

      

    
      - **Mode** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        Provides the following modes to enable ``QueryInsights``:

         

        
        * ``ENABLED_WITH_RATE_CONTROL`` – Enables ``QueryInsights`` for the queries being processed. This mode also includes a rate control mechanism, which limits the ``QueryInsights`` feature to 1 query per second (QPS).
         
        * ``DISABLED`` – Disables ``QueryInsights``.
        

        

      
    
    :type PaginationConfig: dict
    :param PaginationConfig: 

      A dictionary that provides parameters to control pagination.

      

    
      - **MaxItems** *(integer) --* 

        The total number of items to return. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified in max-items then a ``NextToken`` will be provided in the output that you can use to resume pagination.

        

      
      - **PageSize** *(integer) --* 

        The size of each page.

        

      
      - **StartingToken** *(string) --* 

        A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previous response.
