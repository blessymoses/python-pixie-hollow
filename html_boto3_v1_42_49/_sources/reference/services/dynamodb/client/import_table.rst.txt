  :type ClientToken: string
  :param ClientToken: 

    Providing a ``ClientToken`` makes the call to ``ImportTableInput`` idempotent, meaning that multiple identical calls have the same effect as one single call.

     

    A client token is valid for 8 hours after the first request that uses it is completed. After 8 hours, any request with the same client token is treated as a new request. Do not resubmit the same request with the same client token for more than 8 hours, or the result might not be idempotent.

     

    If you submit a request with the same client token but a change in other parameters within the 8-hour idempotency window, DynamoDB returns an ``IdempotentParameterMismatch`` exception.

    This field is autopopulated if not provided.

  
  :type S3BucketSource: dict

      The key prefix shared by all S3 Objects that are being imported.

      

    
  
  :type InputFormat: string
  :param InputFormat: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The format of the source data. Valid values for ``ImportFormat`` are ``CSV``, ``DYNAMODB_JSON`` or ``ION``.

    

  
  :type InputFormatOptions: dict
  :param InputFormatOptions: 

    Additional properties that specify how the input is formatted,

    

  
    - **Csv** *(dict) --* 

      The options for imported source files in CSV format. The values are Delimiter and HeaderList.

      

    
      - **Delimiter** *(string) --* 

        The delimiter used for separating items in the CSV file being imported.

        

      
      - **HeaderList** *(list) --* 

        List of the headers used to specify a common header for all source CSV files being imported. If this field is specified then the first line of each CSV file is treated as data instead of the header. If this field is not specified the the first line of each CSV file is treated as the header.

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
    
    
  
  :type InputCompressionType: string

  :type TableCreationParameters: dict
  :param TableCreationParameters: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Parameters for the table to import the data into.

    

  
    - **TableName** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The name of the table created as part of the import operation.

      

    
    - **AttributeDefinitions** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The attributes of the table created as part of the import operation.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        Represents an attribute for describing the schema for the table and indexes.

        

      
        - **AttributeName** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          A name for the attribute.

          

        
        - **AttributeType** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The data type for the attribute, where:

           

          
          * ``S`` - the attribute is of type String
           
          * ``N`` - the attribute is of type Number
           
          * ``B`` - the attribute is of type Binary
          

          

        
      
  
    - **KeySchema** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The primary key and option sort key of the table created as part of the import operation.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        Represents *a single element* of a key schema. A key schema specifies the attributes that make up the primary key of a table, or the key attributes of an index.

         

        A ``KeySchemaElement`` represents exactly one attribute of the primary key. For example, a simple primary key would be represented by one ``KeySchemaElement`` (for the partition key). A composite primary key would require one ``KeySchemaElement`` for the partition key, and another ``KeySchemaElement`` for the sort key.

         

        A ``KeySchemaElement`` must be a scalar, top-level attribute (not a nested attribute). The data type must be one of String, Number, or Binary. The attribute cannot be nested within a List or a Map.

        

      
        - **AttributeName** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The name of a key attribute.

          

        
        - **KeyType** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The role that this key attribute will assume:

           

          
          * ``HASH`` - partition key
           
          * ``RANGE`` - sort key
          

           

          .. note::

            

            The partition key of an item is also known as its *hash attribute*. The term "hash attribute" derives from DynamoDB's usage of an internal hash function to evenly distribute data items across partitions, based on their partition key values.

             

            The sort key of an item is also known as its *range attribute*. The term "range attribute" derives from the way DynamoDB stores items with the same partition key physically close together, in sorted order by the sort key value.

            

          

        
      
  
    - **BillingMode** *(string) --* 

      The billing mode for provisioning the table created as part of the import operation.

      

    
    - **ProvisionedThroughput** *(dict) --* 

      Represents the provisioned throughput settings for the specified global secondary index. You must use ``ProvisionedThroughput`` or ``OnDemandThroughput`` based on your table’s capacity mode.

       

      For current minimum and maximum provisioned throughput values, see `Service, Account, and Table Quotas <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Limits.html>`__ in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.

      

    
      - **ReadCapacityUnits** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The maximum number of strongly consistent reads consumed per second before DynamoDB returns a ``ThrottlingException``. For more information, see `Specifying Read and Write Requirements <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ProvisionedThroughput.html>`__ in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.

         

        If read/write capacity mode is ``PAY_PER_REQUEST`` the value is set to 0.

        

      
      - **WriteCapacityUnits** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The maximum number of writes consumed per second before DynamoDB returns a ``ThrottlingException``. For more information, see `Specifying Read and Write Requirements <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ProvisionedThroughput.html>`__ in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.

         

        If read/write capacity mode is ``PAY_PER_REQUEST`` the value is set to 0.

        

      
    
    - **OnDemandThroughput** *(dict) --* 

      Sets the maximum number of read and write units for the specified on-demand table. If you use this parameter, you must specify ``MaxReadRequestUnits``, ``MaxWriteRequestUnits``, or both.

      

    
      - **MaxReadRequestUnits** *(integer) --* 

        Maximum number of read request units for the specified table.

         

        To specify a maximum ``OnDemandThroughput`` on your table, set the value of ``MaxReadRequestUnits`` as greater than or equal to 1. To remove the maximum ``OnDemandThroughput`` that is currently set on your table, set the value of ``MaxReadRequestUnits`` to -1.

        

      
      - **MaxWriteRequestUnits** *(integer) --* 

        Maximum number of write request units for the specified table.

         

        To specify a maximum ``OnDemandThroughput`` on your table, set the value of ``MaxWriteRequestUnits`` as greater than or equal to 1. To remove the maximum ``OnDemandThroughput`` that is currently set on your table, set the value of ``MaxWriteRequestUnits`` to -1.

        

      
    
    - **SSESpecification** *(dict) --* 

      Represents the settings used to enable server-side encryption.

      

    
      - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

        Indicates whether server-side encryption is done using an Amazon Web Services managed key or an Amazon Web Services owned key. If enabled (true), server-side encryption type is set to ``KMS`` and an Amazon Web Services managed key is used (KMS charges apply). If disabled (false) or not specified, server-side encryption is set to Amazon Web Services owned key.

        

      
      - **SSEType** *(string) --* 

        Server-side encryption type. The only supported value is:

         

        
        * ``KMS`` - Server-side encryption that uses Key Management Service. The key is stored in your account and is managed by KMS (KMS charges apply).
        

        

      
      - **KMSMasterKeyId** *(string) --* 

        The KMS key that should be used for the KMS encryption. To specify a key, use its key ID, Amazon Resource Name (ARN), alias name, or alias ARN. Note that you should only provide this parameter if the key is different from the default DynamoDB key ``alias/aws/dynamodb``.

        

      
    
    - **GlobalSecondaryIndexes** *(list) --* 

      The Global Secondary Indexes (GSI) of the table to be created as part of the import operation.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        Represents the properties of a global secondary index.

        

      
        - **IndexName** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The name of the global secondary index. The name must be unique among all other indexes on this table.

          

        
        - **KeySchema** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The complete key schema for a global secondary index, which consists of one or more pairs of attribute names and key types:

           

          
          * ``HASH`` - partition key
           
          * ``RANGE`` - sort key
          

           

          .. note::

            

            The partition key of an item is also known as its *hash attribute*. The term "hash attribute" derives from DynamoDB's usage of an internal hash function to evenly distribute data items across partitions, based on their partition key values.

             

            The sort key of an item is also known as its *range attribute*. The term "range attribute" derives from the way DynamoDB stores items with the same partition key physically close together, in sorted order by the sort key value.

            

          

        
          - *(dict) --* 

            Represents *a single element* of a key schema. A key schema specifies the attributes that make up the primary key of a table, or the key attributes of an index.

             

            A ``KeySchemaElement`` represents exactly one attribute of the primary key. For example, a simple primary key would be represented by one ``KeySchemaElement`` (for the partition key). A composite primary key would require one ``KeySchemaElement`` for the partition key, and another ``KeySchemaElement`` for the sort key.

             

            A ``KeySchemaElement`` must be a scalar, top-level attribute (not a nested attribute). The data type must be one of String, Number, or Binary. The attribute cannot be nested within a List or a Map.

            

          
            - **AttributeName** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

              The name of a key attribute.

              

            
            - **KeyType** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

              The role that this key attribute will assume:

               

              
              * ``HASH`` - partition key
               
              * ``RANGE`` - sort key
              

               

              .. note::

                

                The partition key of an item is also known as its *hash attribute*. The term "hash attribute" derives from DynamoDB's usage of an internal hash function to evenly distribute data items across partitions, based on their partition key values.

The term "range attribute" derives from the way DynamoDB stores items with the same partition key physically close together, in sorted order by the sort key value.

                

              

            
          
      
        - **Projection** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          Represents attributes that are copied (projected) from the table into the global secondary index. These are in addition to the primary key attributes and index key attributes, which are automatically projected.

          

        
          - **ProjectionType** *(string) --* 

            The set of attributes that are projected into the index:

             

            
            * ``KEYS_ONLY`` - Only the index and primary keys are projected into the index.
             
            * ``INCLUDE`` - In addition to the attributes described in ``KEYS_ONLY``, the secondary index will include other non-key attributes that you specify.
             
            * ``ALL`` - All of the table attributes are projected into the index.
            

             

            When using the DynamoDB console, ``ALL`` is selected by default.

            

          
          - **NonKeyAttributes** *(list) --* 

            Represents the non-key attribute names which will be projected into the index.

             

            For global and local secondary indexes, the total count of ``NonKeyAttributes`` summed across all of the secondary indexes, must not exceed 100. If you project the same attribute into two different indexes, this counts as two distinct attributes when determining the total. This limit only applies when you specify the ProjectionType of ``INCLUDE``. You still can specify the ProjectionType of ``ALL`` to project all attributes from the source table, even if the table has more than 100 attributes.

            

          
            - *(string) --* 

            
        
        
        - **ProvisionedThroughput** *(dict) --* 

          Represents the provisioned throughput settings for the specified global secondary index. You must use either ``OnDemandThroughput`` or ``ProvisionedThroughput`` based on your table's capacity mode.

           

          For current minimum and maximum provisioned throughput values, see `Service, Account, and Table Quotas <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Limits.html>`__ in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.

          

        
          - **ReadCapacityUnits** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The maximum number of strongly consistent reads consumed per second before DynamoDB returns a ``ThrottlingException``. For more information, see `Specifying Read and Write Requirements <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ProvisionedThroughput.html>`__ in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.

             

            If read/write capacity mode is ``PAY_PER_REQUEST`` the value is set to 0.

            

          
          - **WriteCapacityUnits** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The maximum number of writes consumed per second before DynamoDB returns a ``ThrottlingException``. For more information, see `Specifying Read and Write Requirements <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ProvisionedThroughput.html>`__ in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.

             

            If read/write capacity mode is ``PAY_PER_REQUEST`` the value is set to 0.

            

          
        
        - **OnDemandThroughput** *(dict) --* 

          The maximum number of read and write units for the specified global secondary index. If you use this parameter, you must specify ``MaxReadRequestUnits``, ``MaxWriteRequestUnits``, or both. You must use either ``OnDemandThroughput`` or ``ProvisionedThroughput`` based on your table's capacity mode.

          

        
          - **MaxReadRequestUnits** *(integer) --* 

            Maximum number of read request units for the specified table.

             

            To specify a maximum ``OnDemandThroughput`` on your table, set the value of ``MaxReadRequestUnits`` as greater than or equal to 1. To remove the maximum ``OnDemandThroughput`` that is currently set on your table, set the value of ``MaxReadRequestUnits`` to -1.

            

          
          - **MaxWriteRequestUnits** *(integer) --* 

            Maximum number of write request units for the specified table.

            - *(dict) --* 

              Represents *a single element* of a key schema. A key schema specifies the attributes that make up the primary key of a table, or the key attributes of an index.

               

              A ``KeySchemaElement`` represents exactly one attribute of the primary key. For example, a simple primary key would be represented by one ``KeySchemaElement`` (for the partition key). A composite primary key would require one ``KeySchemaElement`` for the partition key, and another ``KeySchemaElement`` for the sort key.

               

              A ``KeySchemaElement`` must be a scalar, top-level attribute (not a nested attribute). The data type must be one of String, Number, or Binary. The attribute cannot be nested within a List or a Map.

              
              

              - **AttributeName** *(string) --* 

                The name of a key attribute.

                
              

              - **KeyType** *(string) --* 

                The role that this key attribute will assume:

                 

                
                * ``HASH`` - partition key
                 
                * ``RANGE`` - sort key
                

                 

                .. note::

                  

                  The partition key of an item is also known as its *hash attribute*. The term "hash attribute" derives from DynamoDB's usage of an internal hash function to evenly distribute data items across partitions, based on their partition key values.

                   

                  The sort key of an item is also known as its *range attribute*. The term "range attribute" derives from the way DynamoDB stores items with the same partition key physically close together, in sorted order by the sort key value.

              If read/write capacity mode is ``PAY_PER_REQUEST`` the value is set to 0.

              
            

            - **WriteCapacityUnits** *(integer) --* 

              The maximum number of writes consumed per second before DynamoDB returns a ``ThrottlingException``. For more information, see `Specifying Read and Write Requirements <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ProvisionedThroughput.html>`__ in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.

          - **OnDemandThroughput** *(dict) --* 

            Sets the maximum number of read and write units for the specified on-demand table. If you use this parameter, you must specify ``MaxReadRequestUnits``, ``MaxWriteRequestUnits``, or both.

            
            

            - **MaxReadRequestUnits** *(integer) --* 

              Maximum number of read request units for the specified table.

               

              To specify a maximum ``OnDemandThroughput`` on your table, set the value of ``MaxReadRequestUnits`` as greater than or equal to 1. To remove the maximum ``OnDemandThroughput`` that is currently set on your table, set the value of ``MaxReadRequestUnits`` to -1.

              
            

            - **MaxWriteRequestUnits** *(integer) --*

To remove the maximum ``OnDemandThroughput`` that is currently set on your table, set the value of ``MaxWriteRequestUnits`` to -1.

              
        
          

          - **SSESpecification** *(dict) --* 

            Represents the settings used to enable server-side encryption.

            
            

            - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

              Indicates whether server-side encryption is done using an Amazon Web Services managed key or an Amazon Web Services owned key. If enabled (true), server-side encryption type is set to ``KMS`` and an Amazon Web Services managed key is used (KMS charges apply). If disabled (false) or not specified, server-side encryption is set to Amazon Web Services owned key.

              
            

            - **SSEType** *(string) --* 

              Server-side encryption type. The only supported value is:

               

              
              * ``KMS`` - Server-side encryption that uses Key Management Service. The key is stored in your account and is managed by KMS (KMS charges apply).

              Represents the properties of a global secondary index.

              
              

              - **IndexName** *(string) --* 

                The name of the global secondary index. The name must be unique among all other indexes on this table.

                
              

              - **KeySchema** *(list) --* 

                The complete key schema for a global secondary index, which consists of one or more pairs of attribute names and key types:

                * ``RANGE`` - sort key
                

                 

                .. note::

                  

                  The partition key of an item is also known as its *hash attribute*. The term "hash attribute" derives from DynamoDB's usage of an internal hash function to evenly distribute data items across partitions, based on their partition key values.

                   

                  The sort key of an item is also known as its *range attribute*. The term "range attribute" derives from the way DynamoDB stores items with the same partition key physically close together, in sorted order by the sort key value.

                  

                
                

                - *(dict) --* 

                  Represents *a single element* of a key schema. A key schema specifies the attributes that make up the primary key of a table, or the key attributes of an index.

                   

                  A ``KeySchemaElement`` represents exactly one attribute of the primary key. For example, a simple primary key would be represented by one ``KeySchemaElement`` (for the partition key). A composite primary key would require one ``KeySchemaElement`` for the partition key, and another ``KeySchemaElement`` for the sort key.

                   

                  A ``KeySchemaElement`` must be a scalar, top-level attribute (not a nested attribute). The data type must be one of String, Number, or Binary. The attribute cannot be nested within a List or a Map.

                  
                  

                  - **AttributeName** *(string) --* 

                    The name of a key attribute.

                    
                  

                  - **KeyType** *(string) --* 

                    The role that this key attribute will assume:

                     

                    
                    * ``HASH`` - partition key
                     
                    * ``RANGE`` - sort key
                    

                     

                    .. note::

                      

                      The partition key of an item is also known as its *hash attribute*. The term "hash attribute" derives from DynamoDB's usage of an internal hash function to evenly distribute data items across partitions, based on their partition key values.

              - **Projection** *(dict) --* 

                Represents attributes that are copied (projected) from the table into the global secondary index. These are in addition to the primary key attributes and index key attributes, which are automatically projected.

                
                

                - **ProjectionType** *(string) --* 

                  The set of attributes that are projected into the index:

                   

                  
                  * ``KEYS_ONLY`` - Only the index and primary keys are projected into the index.
                   
                  * ``INCLUDE`` - In addition to the attributes described in ``KEYS_ONLY``, the secondary index will include other non-key attributes that you specify.
                   
                  * ``ALL`` - All of the table attributes are projected into the index.
                  

                   

                  When using the DynamoDB console, ``ALL`` is selected by default.

                  
                

                - **NonKeyAttributes** *(list) --* 

                  Represents the non-key attribute names which will be projected into the index.

                   

                  For global and local secondary indexes, the total count of ``NonKeyAttributes`` summed across all of the secondary indexes, must not exceed 100. If you project the same attribute into two different indexes, this counts as two distinct attributes when determining the total. This limit only applies when you specify the ProjectionType of ``INCLUDE``. You still can specify the ProjectionType of ``ALL`` to project all attributes from the source table, even if the table has more than 100 attributes.

                The maximum number of read and write units for the specified global secondary index. If you use this parameter, you must specify ``MaxReadRequestUnits``, ``MaxWriteRequestUnits``, or both. You must use either ``OnDemandThroughput`` or ``ProvisionedThroughput`` based on your table's capacity mode.
