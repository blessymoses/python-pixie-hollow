.. py:method:: DynamoDB.Client.describe_continuous_backups(**kwargs)

  

  Checks the status of continuous backups and point in time recovery on the specified table. Continuous backups are ``ENABLED`` on all tables at table creation. If point in time recovery is enabled, ``PointInTimeRecoveryStatus`` will be set to ENABLED.

   

  After continuous backups and point in time recovery are enabled, you can restore to any point in time within ``EarliestRestorableDateTime`` and ``LatestRestorableDateTime``.

   

  ``LatestRestorableDateTime`` is typically 5 minutes before the current time. You can restore your table to any point in time in the last 35 days. You can set the recovery period to any value between 1 and 35 days.

   

  You can call ``DescribeContinuousBackups`` at a maximum rate of 10 times per second.
