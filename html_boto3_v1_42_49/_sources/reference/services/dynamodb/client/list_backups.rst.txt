.. py:method:: DynamoDB.Client.list_backups(**kwargs)

  

  List DynamoDB backups that are associated with an Amazon Web Services account and weren't made with Amazon Web Services Backup. To list these backups for a given table, specify ``TableName``. ``ListBackups`` returns a paginated list of results with at most 1 MB worth of items in a page. You can also specify a maximum number of entries to be returned in a page.

   

  In the request, start time is inclusive, but end time is exclusive. Note that these boundaries are for the time at which the original backup was requested.

   

  You can call ``ListBackups`` a maximum of five times per second.

   

  If you want to retrieve the complete list of backups made with Amazon Web Services Backup, use the `Amazon Web Services Backup list API. <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/API_ListBackupJobs.html>`__

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_backups(
        TableName='string',
        Limit=123,
        TimeRangeLowerBound=datetime(2015, 1, 1),
        TimeRangeUpperBound=datetime(2015, 1, 1),
        ExclusiveStartBackupArn='string',
        BackupType='USER'|'SYSTEM'|'AWS_BACKUP'|'ALL'
    )
    
  :type TableName: string
  :param TableName: 

    Lists the backups from the table specified in ``TableName``. You can also provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the table in this parameter.

    

  
  :type Limit: integer
  :param Limit: 

    Maximum number of backups to return at once.

    

  
  :type TimeRangeLowerBound: datetime
  :param TimeRangeLowerBound: 

    Only backups created after this time are listed. ``TimeRangeLowerBound`` is inclusive.

    

  
  :type TimeRangeUpperBound: datetime
  :param TimeRangeUpperBound: 

    Only backups created before this time are listed. ``TimeRangeUpperBound`` is exclusive.

    

  
  :type ExclusiveStartBackupArn: string
  :param ExclusiveStartBackupArn: 

    ``LastEvaluatedBackupArn`` is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the backup last evaluated when the current page of results was returned, inclusive of the current page of results. This value may be specified as the ``ExclusiveStartBackupArn`` of a new ``ListBackups`` operation in order to fetch the next page of results.

    

  
  :type BackupType: string
  :param BackupType: 

    The backups from the table specified by ``BackupType`` are listed.

     

    Where ``BackupType`` can be:

     

    
    * ``USER`` - On-demand backup created by you. (The default setting if no other backup types are specified.)
     
    * ``SYSTEM`` - On-demand backup automatically created by DynamoDB.
     
    * ``ALL`` - All types of on-demand backups (USER and SYSTEM).

            Name of the specified backup.

            
          

          - **BackupCreationDateTime** *(datetime) --* 

            Time at which the backup was created.

            
          

          - **BackupExpiryDateTime** *(datetime) --* 

            Time at which the automatic on-demand backup created by DynamoDB will expire. This ``SYSTEM`` on-demand backup expires automatically 35 days after its creation.

            
          

          - **BackupStatus** *(string) --* 

            Backup can be in one of the following states: CREATING, ACTIVE, DELETED.

            
          

          - **BackupType** *(string) --* 

            BackupType:

             

            
            * ``USER`` - You create and manage these using the on-demand backup feature.
             
            * ``SYSTEM`` - If you delete a table with point-in-time recovery enabled, a ``SYSTEM`` backup is automatically created and is retained for 35 days (at no additional cost). System backups allow you to restore the deleted table to the state it was in just before the point of deletion.
             
            * ``AWS_BACKUP`` - On-demand backup created by you from Backup service.
            

            
          

          - **BackupSizeBytes** *(integer) --*

        If ``LastEvaluatedBackupArn`` is empty, then the last page of results has been processed and there are no more results to be retrieved.

         

        If ``LastEvaluatedBackupArn`` is not empty, this may or may not indicate that there is more data to be returned. All results are guaranteed to have been returned if and only if no value for ``LastEvaluatedBackupArn`` is returned.
