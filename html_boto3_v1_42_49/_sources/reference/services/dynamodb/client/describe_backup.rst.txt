          - **BackupStatus** *(string) --* 

            Backup can be in one of the following states: CREATING, ACTIVE, DELETED.

            
          

          - **BackupType** *(string) --* 

            BackupType:

             

            
            * ``USER`` - You create and manage these using the on-demand backup feature.
             
            * ``SYSTEM`` - If you delete a table with point-in-time recovery enabled, a ``SYSTEM`` backup is automatically created and is retained for 35 days (at no additional cost). System backups allow you to restore the deleted table to the state it was in just before the point of deletion.
             
            * ``AWS_BACKUP`` - On-demand backup created by you from Backup service.
            

            
          

          - **BackupCreationDateTime** *(datetime) --* 

            Time at which the backup was created. This is the request time of the backup.

            
          

          - **BackupExpiryDateTime** *(datetime) --* 

            Time at which the automatic on-demand backup created by DynamoDB will expire. This ``SYSTEM`` on-demand backup expires automatically 35 days after its creation.

            
      
        

        - **SourceTableDetails** *(dict) --* 

          Contains the details of the table when the backup was created.

          
          

          - **TableName** *(string) --* 

            The name of the table for which the backup was created.

            
          

          - **TableId** *(string) --*

            ARN of the table for which backup was created.

            
          

          - **TableSizeBytes** *(integer) --* 

            Size of the table in bytes. Note that this is an approximate value.

            
          

          - **KeySchema** *(list) --* 

            Schema of the table.

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

              Represents *a single element* of a key schema. A key schema specifies the attributes that make up the primary key of a table, or the key attributes of an index.

               

              A ``KeySchemaElement`` represents exactly one attribute of the primary key. For example, a simple primary key would be represented by one ``KeySchemaElement`` (for the partition key). A composite primary key would require one ``KeySchemaElement`` for the partition key, and another ``KeySchemaElement`` for the sort key.

               

              A ``KeySchemaElement`` must be a scalar, top-level attribute (not a nested attribute). The data type must be one of String, Number, or Binary. The attribute cannot be nested within a List or a Map.

              
              

              - **AttributeName** *(string) --* 

                The name of a key attribute.

                
              

              - **KeyType** *(string) --* 

                The role that this key attribute will assume:

                 

                
                * ``HASH`` - partition key
                 
                * ``RANGE`` - sort key
                

                 

                .. note::

                  

                  The partition key of an item is also known as its *hash attribute*. The term "hash attribute" derives from DynamoDB's usage of an internal hash function to evenly distribute data items across partitions, based on their partition key values.

                   

                  The sort key of an item is also known as its *range attribute*. The term "range attribute" derives from the way DynamoDB stores items with the same partition key physically close together, in sorted order by the sort key value.

                  

                
          
        
          

          - **TableCreationDateTime** *(datetime) --* 

            Time when the source table was created.

            
          

          - **ProvisionedThroughput** *(dict) --* 

            Read IOPs and Write IOPS on the table when the backup was created.

            
            

            - **ReadCapacityUnits** *(integer) --* 

              The maximum number of strongly consistent reads consumed per second before DynamoDB returns a ``ThrottlingException``. For more information, see `Specifying Read and Write Requirements <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ProvisionedThroughput.html>`__ in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.

               

              If read/write capacity mode is ``PAY_PER_REQUEST`` the value is set to 0.

              
            

            - **WriteCapacityUnits** *(integer) --* 

              The maximum number of writes consumed per second before DynamoDB returns a ``ThrottlingException``. For more information, see `Specifying Read and Write Requirements <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ProvisionedThroughput.html>`__ in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.

               

              If read/write capacity mode is ``PAY_PER_REQUEST`` the value is set to 0.

              
        
          

          - **OnDemandThroughput** *(dict) --* 

            Sets the maximum number of read and write units for the specified on-demand table. If you use this parameter, you must specify ``MaxReadRequestUnits``, ``MaxWriteRequestUnits``, or both.

            
            

            - **MaxReadRequestUnits** *(integer) --* 

              Maximum number of read request units for the specified table.

               

              To specify a maximum ``OnDemandThroughput`` on your table, set the value of ``MaxReadRequestUnits`` as greater than or equal to 1. To remove the maximum ``OnDemandThroughput`` that is currently set on your table, set the value of ``MaxReadRequestUnits`` to -1.

              
            

            - **MaxWriteRequestUnits** *(integer) --* 

              Maximum number of write request units for the specified table.

               

              To specify a maximum ``OnDemandThroughput`` on your table, set the value of ``MaxWriteRequestUnits`` as greater than or equal to 1. To remove the maximum ``OnDemandThroughput`` that is currently set on your table, set the value of ``MaxWriteRequestUnits`` to -1.

              
        
          

          - **ItemCount** *(integer) --* 

            Number of items in the table. Note that this is an approximate value.

            
          

          - **BillingMode** *(string) --* 

            Controls how you are charged for read and write throughput and how you manage capacity. This setting can be changed later.

             

            
            * ``PROVISIONED`` - Sets the read/write capacity mode to ``PROVISIONED``. We recommend using ``PROVISIONED`` for predictable workloads.
             
            * ``PAY_PER_REQUEST`` - Sets the read/write capacity mode to ``PAY_PER_REQUEST``. We recommend using ``PAY_PER_REQUEST`` for unpredictable workloads.
            

            
      
        

        - **SourceTableFeatureDetails** *(dict) --* 

          Contains the details of the features enabled on the table when the backup was created. For example, LSIs, GSIs, streams, TTL.

          
          

          - **LocalSecondaryIndexes** *(list) --* 

            Represents the LSI properties for the table when the backup was created. It includes the IndexName, KeySchema and Projection for the LSIs on the table at the time of backup.

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

              Represents the properties of a local secondary index for the table when the backup was created.

              - **KeySchema** *(list) --* 

                The complete key schema for a local secondary index, which consists of one or more pairs of attribute names and key types:

                 

                
                * ``HASH`` - partition key
                 
                * ``RANGE`` - sort key

The term "range attribute" derives from the way DynamoDB stores items with the same partition key physically close together, in sorted order by the sort key value.

                      

                    
              
            
              

              - **Projection** *(dict) --* 

                Represents attributes that are copied (projected) from the table into the global secondary index. These are in addition to the primary key attributes and index key attributes, which are automatically projected.

                
                

                - **ProjectionType** *(string) --* 

                  The set of attributes that are projected into the index:

                   

                  
                  * ``KEYS_ONLY`` - Only the index and primary keys are projected into the index.
                   
                  * ``INCLUDE`` - In addition to the attributes described in ``KEYS_ONLY``, the secondary index will include other non-key attributes that you specify.
                   
                  * ``ALL`` - All of the table attributes are projected into the index.
                  

                   

                  When using the DynamoDB console, ``ALL`` is selected by default.

                  
                

                - **NonKeyAttributes** *(list) --* 

                  Represents the non-key attribute names which will be projected into the index.

                   

                  For global and local secondary indexes, the total count of ``NonKeyAttributes`` summed across all of the secondary indexes, must not exceed 100. If you project the same attribute into two different indexes, this counts as two distinct attributes when determining the total. This limit only applies when you specify the ProjectionType of ``INCLUDE``. You still can specify the ProjectionType of ``ALL`` to project all attributes from the source table, even if the table has more than 100 attributes.

                  
                  

                  - *(string) --* 
              
            
          
        
          

          - **GlobalSecondaryIndexes** *(list) --* 

            Represents the GSI properties for the table when the backup was created. It includes the IndexName, KeySchema, Projection, and ProvisionedThroughput for the GSIs on the table at the time of backup.

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

              Represents the properties of a global secondary index for the table when the backup was created.

              
              

              - **IndexName** *(string) --* 

                The name of the global secondary index.

                
              

              - **KeySchema** *(list) --* 

                The complete key schema for a global secondary index, which consists of one or more pairs of attribute names and key types:

                 

                
                * ``HASH`` - partition key
                 
                * ``RANGE`` - sort key
                

                 

                .. note::

                  

                  The partition key of an item is also known as its *hash attribute*. The term "hash attribute" derives from DynamoDB's usage of an internal hash function to evenly distribute data items across partitions, based on their partition key values.

                   

                  The sort key of an item is also known as its *range attribute*. The term "range attribute" derives from the way DynamoDB stores items with the same partition key physically close together, in sorted order by the sort key value.

                  

                
                

                - *(dict) --* 

                  Represents *a single element* of a key schema. A key schema specifies the attributes that make up the primary key of a table, or the key attributes of an index.

                   

                  A ``KeySchemaElement`` represents exactly one attribute of the primary key. For example, a simple primary key would be represented by one ``KeySchemaElement`` (for the partition key). A composite primary key would require one ``KeySchemaElement`` for the partition key, and another ``KeySchemaElement`` for the sort key.

                   

                  A ``KeySchemaElement`` must be a scalar, top-level attribute (not a nested attribute). The data type must be one of String, Number, or Binary. The attribute cannot be nested within a List or a Map.

                  
                  

                  - **AttributeName** *(string) --* 

                    The name of a key attribute.

                    
                  

                  - **KeyType** *(string) --* 

                    The role that this key attribute will assume:

                     

                    
                    * ``HASH`` - partition key
                     
                    * ``RANGE`` - sort key

                - **ProjectionType** *(string) --* 

                  The set of attributes that are projected into the index:

                   

                  
                  * ``KEYS_ONLY`` - Only the index and primary keys are projected into the index.

                  When using the DynamoDB console, ``ALL`` is selected by default.

                  
                

                - **NonKeyAttributes** *(list) --* 

                  Represents the non-key attribute names which will be projected into the index.
