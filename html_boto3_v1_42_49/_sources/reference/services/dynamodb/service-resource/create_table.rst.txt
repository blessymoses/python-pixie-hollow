.. py:method:: DynamoDB.ServiceResource.create_table(**kwargs)

  

  The ``CreateTable`` operation adds a new table to your account. In an Amazon Web Services account, table names must be unique within each Region. That is, you can have two tables with same name if you create the tables in different Regions.

   

  ``CreateTable`` is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving a ``CreateTable`` request, DynamoDB immediately returns a response with a ``TableStatus`` of ``CREATING``. After the table is created, DynamoDB sets the ``TableStatus`` to ``ACTIVE``. You can perform read and write operations only on an ``ACTIVE`` table.

   

  You can optionally define secondary indexes on the new table, as part of the ``CreateTable`` operation. If you want to create multiple tables with secondary indexes on them, you must create the tables sequentially. Only one table with secondary indexes can be in the ``CREATING`` state at any given time.

   

  You can use the ``DescribeTable`` action to check the table status.

  :type AttributeDefinitions: list
  :param AttributeDefinitions: 

    An array of attributes that describe the key schema for the table and indexes.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      Represents an attribute for describing the schema for the table and indexes.

      

    
      - **AttributeName** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        A name for the attribute.

        

      
      - **AttributeType** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The data type for the attribute, where:

         

        
        * ``S`` - the attribute is of type String
         
        * ``N`` - the attribute is of type Number
         
        * ``B`` - the attribute is of type Binary
        

        

      
    

  :type TableName: string
  :param TableName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of the table to create. You can also provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the table in this parameter.

    

  
  :type KeySchema: list
  :param KeySchema: 

    Specifies the attributes that make up the primary key for a table or an index. The attributes in ``KeySchema`` must also be defined in the ``AttributeDefinitions`` array. For more information, see `Data Model <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DataModel.html>`__ in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.

     

    Each ``KeySchemaElement`` in the array is composed of:

     

    
    * ``AttributeName`` - The name of this key attribute.
     
    * ``KeyType`` - The role that the key attribute will assume: 

      
      * ``HASH`` - partition key
       
      * ``RANGE`` - sort key
      

    
    

     

    .. note::

      

      The partition key of an item is also known as its *hash attribute*. The term "hash attribute" derives from the DynamoDB usage of an internal hash function to evenly distribute data items across partitions, based on their partition key values.

       

      The sort key of an item is also known as its *range attribute*. The term "range attribute" derives from the way DynamoDB stores items with the same partition key physically close together, in sorted order by the sort key value.

      

     

    For a simple primary key (partition key), you must provide exactly one element with a ``KeyType`` of ``HASH``.

     

    For a composite primary key (partition key and sort key), you must provide exactly two elements, in this order: The first element must have a ``KeyType`` of ``HASH``, and the second element must have a ``KeyType`` of ``RANGE``.

     

    For more information, see `Working with Tables <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/WorkingWithTables.html#WorkingWithTables.primary.key>`__ in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      Represents *a single element* of a key schema. A key schema specifies the attributes that make up the primary key of a table, or the key attributes of an index.

       

      A ``KeySchemaElement`` represents exactly one attribute of the primary key. For example, a simple primary key would be represented by one ``KeySchemaElement`` (for the partition key). A composite primary key would require one ``KeySchemaElement`` for the partition key, and another ``KeySchemaElement`` for the sort key.

       

      A ``KeySchemaElement`` must be a scalar, top-level attribute (not a nested attribute). The data type must be one of String, Number, or Binary. The attribute cannot be nested within a List or a Map.

      

    
      - **AttributeName** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The name of a key attribute.

        

      
      - **KeyType** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The role that this key attribute will assume:

         

        
        * ``HASH`` - partition key
         
        * ``RANGE`` - sort key
        

         

        .. note::

          

          The partition key of an item is also known as its *hash attribute*. The term "hash attribute" derives from DynamoDB's usage of an internal hash function to evenly distribute data items across partitions, based on their partition key values.

           

          The sort key of an item is also known as its *range attribute*. The term "range attribute" derives from the way DynamoDB stores items with the same partition key physically close together, in sorted order by the sort key value.

          

        

      
    

  :type LocalSecondaryIndexes: list
  :param LocalSecondaryIndexes: 

    One or more local secondary indexes (the maximum is 5) to be created on the table. Each index is scoped to a given partition key value. There is a 10 GB size limit per partition key value; otherwise, the size of a local secondary index is unconstrained.

     

    Each local secondary index in the array includes the following:

     

    
    * ``IndexName`` - The name of the local secondary index. Must be unique only for this table.
     
    * ``KeySchema`` - Specifies the key schema for the local secondary index. The key schema must begin with the same partition key as the table.
     
    * ``Projection`` - Specifies attributes that are copied (projected) from the table into the index. These are in addition to the primary key attributes and index key attributes, which are automatically projected. Each attribute specification is composed of: 

      
      * ``ProjectionType`` - One of the following: 

        
        * ``KEYS_ONLY`` - Only the index and primary keys are projected into the index.
         
        * ``INCLUDE`` - Only the specified table attributes are projected into the index. The list of projected attributes is in ``NonKeyAttributes``.
         
        * ``ALL`` - All of the table attributes are projected into the index.
        

      
       
      * ``NonKeyAttributes`` - A list of one or more non-key attribute names that are projected into the secondary index. The total count of attributes provided in ``NonKeyAttributes``, summed across all of the secondary indexes, must not exceed 100. If you project the same attribute into two different indexes, this counts as two distinct attributes when determining the total. This limit only applies when you specify the ProjectionType of ``INCLUDE``. You still can specify the ProjectionType of ``ALL`` to project all attributes from the source table, even if the table has more than 100 attributes.
      

    
    

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      Represents the properties of a local secondary index.

      

    
      - **IndexName** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

        The complete key schema for the local secondary index, consisting of one or more pairs of attribute names and key types:

         

        
        * ``HASH`` - partition key
         
        * ``RANGE`` - sort key

          The set of attributes that are projected into the index:

           

          
          * ``KEYS_ONLY`` - Only the index and primary keys are projected into the index.

          * ``ALL`` - All of the table attributes are projected into the index.
          

           

          When using the DynamoDB console, ``ALL`` is selected by default.

          

        
        - **NonKeyAttributes** *(list) --* 

          Represents the non-key attribute names which will be projected into the index.

           

          For global and local secondary indexes, the total count of ``NonKeyAttributes`` summed across all of the secondary indexes, must not exceed 100. If you project the same attribute into two different indexes, this counts as two distinct attributes when determining the total. This limit only applies when you specify the ProjectionType of ``INCLUDE``. You still can specify the ProjectionType of ``ALL`` to project all attributes from the source table, even if the table has more than 100 attributes.

      Indicates whether server-side encryption is done using an Amazon Web Services managed key or an Amazon Web Services owned key. If enabled (true), server-side encryption type is set to ``KMS`` and an Amazon Web Services managed key is used (KMS charges apply). If disabled (false) or not specified, server-side encryption is set to Amazon Web Services owned key.

      

    
    - **SSEType** *(string) --* 

      Server-side encryption type. The only supported value is:

       

      
      * ``KMS`` - Server-side encryption that uses Key Management Service. The key is stored in your account and is managed by KMS (KMS charges apply).
      

      

    
    - **KMSMasterKeyId** *(string) --* 

      The KMS key that should be used for the KMS encryption. To specify a key, use its key ID, Amazon Resource Name (ARN), alias name, or alias ARN. Note that you should only provide this parameter if the key is different from the default DynamoDB key ``alias/aws/dynamodb``.

      

    
  
  :type Tags: list
  :param Tags: 

    A list of key-value pairs to label the table. For more information, see `Tagging for DynamoDB <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Tagging.html>`__.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      Describes a tag. A tag is a key-value pair. You can add up to 50 tags to a single DynamoDB table.

       

      Amazon Web Services-assigned tag names and values are automatically assigned the ``aws:`` prefix, which the user cannot assign. Amazon Web Services-assigned tag names do not count towards the tag limit of 50. User-assigned tag names have the prefix ``user:`` in the Cost Allocation Report. You cannot backdate the application of a tag.

       

      For an overview on tagging DynamoDB resources, see `Tagging for DynamoDB <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Tagging.html>`__ in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.

      

    
      - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The key of the tag. Tag keys are case sensitive. Each DynamoDB table can only have up to one tag with the same key. If you try to add an existing tag (same key), the existing tag value will be updated to the new value.

        

      
      - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The value of the tag. Tag values are case-sensitive and can be null.

        

      
    

  :type TableClass: string
  :param TableClass: 

    The table class of the new table. Valid values are ``STANDARD`` and ``STANDARD_INFREQUENT_ACCESS``.

    - **WriteUnitsPerSecond** *(integer) --* 

      Represents the number of write operations your base table can instantaneously support.

      

    
  
  :type ResourcePolicy: string
  :param ResourcePolicy: 

    An Amazon Web Services resource-based policy document in JSON format that will be attached to the table.

     

    When you attach a resource-based policy while creating a table, the policy application is *strongly consistent*.

     

    The maximum size supported for a resource-based policy document is 20 KB. DynamoDB counts whitespaces when calculating the size of a policy against this limit. For a full list of all considerations that apply for resource-based policies, see `Resource-based policy considerations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/rbac-considerations.html>`__.

     

    .. note::

      

      You need to specify the ``CreateTable`` and ``PutResourcePolicy`` IAM actions for authorizing a user to create a table with a resource-based policy.
