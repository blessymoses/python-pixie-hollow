.. py:attribute:: DynamoDB.Table.provisioned_throughput

  

  - *(dict) --* 

    The provisioned throughput settings for the table, consisting of read and write capacity units, along with data about increases and decreases.

    
    

    - **LastIncreaseDateTime** *(datetime) --* 

      The date and time of the last provisioned throughput increase for this table.

      
    

    - **LastDecreaseDateTime** *(datetime) --* 

      The date and time of the last provisioned throughput decrease for this table.

      
    

    - **NumberOfDecreasesToday** *(integer) --* 

      The number of provisioned throughput decreases for this table during this UTC calendar day. For current maximums on provisioned throughput decreases, see `Service, Account, and Table Quotas <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Limits.html>`__ in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.

      
    

    - **ReadCapacityUnits** *(integer) --* 

      The maximum number of strongly consistent reads consumed per second before DynamoDB returns a ``ThrottlingException``. Eventually consistent reads require less effort than strongly consistent reads, so a setting of 50 ``ReadCapacityUnits`` per second provides 100 eventually consistent ``ReadCapacityUnits`` per second.

      
    

    - **WriteCapacityUnits** *(integer) --* 

      The maximum number of writes consumed per second before DynamoDB returns a ``ThrottlingException``.
