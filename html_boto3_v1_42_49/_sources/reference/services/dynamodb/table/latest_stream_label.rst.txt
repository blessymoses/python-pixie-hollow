.. py:attribute:: DynamoDB.Table.latest_stream_label

  

  - *(string) --* 

    A timestamp, in ISO 8601 format, for this stream.

     

    Note that ``LatestStreamLabel`` is not a unique identifier for the stream, because it is possible that a stream from another table might have the same timestamp. However, the combination of the following three elements is guaranteed to be unique:

     

    
    * Amazon Web Services customer ID
     
    * Table name
     
    * ``StreamLabel``
