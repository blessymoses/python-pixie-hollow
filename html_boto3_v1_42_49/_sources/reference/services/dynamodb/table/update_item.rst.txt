.. py:method:: DynamoDB.Table.update_item(**kwargs)

  

  Edits an existing item's attributes, or adds a new item to the table if it does not already exist. You can put, delete, or add attribute values. You can also perform a conditional update on an existing item (insert a new attribute name-value pair if it doesn't exist, or replace an existing name-value pair if it has certain expected attribute values).

   

  You can also return the item's attribute values in the same ``UpdateItem`` operation using the ``ReturnValues`` parameter.

  :type Key: dict
  :param Key: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The primary key of the item to be updated. Each element consists of an attribute name and a value for that attribute.

     

    For the primary key, you must provide all of the attributes. For example, with a simple primary key, you only need to provide a value for the partition key. For a composite primary key, you must provide values for both the partition key and the sort key.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    
      - *(valid DynamoDB type) -- *- The value of the attribute. The valid value types are listed in the :ref:`DynamoDB Reference Guide<ref_valid_dynamodb_types>`.

      
      


  :type AttributeUpdates: dict
  :param AttributeUpdates: 

    This is a legacy parameter. Use ``UpdateExpression`` instead. For more information, see `AttributeUpdates <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/LegacyConditionalParameters.AttributeUpdates.html>`__ in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        For the ``UpdateItem`` operation, represents the attributes to be modified, the action to perform on each, and the new value for each.

         

        .. note::

          

          You cannot use ``UpdateItem`` to update any primary key attributes. Instead, you will need to delete the item, and then use ``PutItem`` to create a new item with new attributes.

          

         

        Attribute values cannot be null; string and binary type attributes must have lengths greater than zero; and set type attributes must not be empty. Requests with empty values will be rejected with a ``ValidationException`` exception.

        

      
        - **Value** *(valid DynamoDB type) -- *- The value of the attribute. The valid value types are listed in the :ref:`DynamoDB Reference Guide<ref_valid_dynamodb_types>`.

        
        
        - **Action** *(string) --* 

          Specifies how to perform the update. Valid values are ``PUT`` (default), ``DELETE``, and ``ADD``. The behavior depends on whether the specified primary key already exists in the table.

           

          If an item with the specified *Key* is found in the table:

           

          
          * ``PUT`` - Adds the specified attribute to the item. If the attribute already exists, it is replaced by the new value.
           
          * ``DELETE`` - If no value is specified, the attribute and its value are removed from the item. The data type of the specified value must match the existing value's data type. If a *set* of values is specified, then those values are subtracted from the old set. For example, if the attribute value was the set ``[a,b,c]`` and the ``DELETE`` action specified ``[a,c]``, then the final attribute value would be ``[b]``. Specifying an empty set is an error.
           
          * ``ADD`` - If the attribute does not already exist, then the attribute and its values are added to the item. If the attribute does exist, then the behavior of ``ADD`` depends on the data type of the attribute: 

            
            * If the existing attribute is a number, and if ``Value`` is also a number, then the ``Value`` is mathematically added to the existing attribute. If ``Value`` is a negative number, then it is subtracted from the existing attribute. 

            .. note::

              If you use ``ADD`` to increment or decrement a number value for an item that doesn't exist before the update, DynamoDB uses 0 as the initial value. In addition, if you use ``ADD`` to update an existing item, and intend to increment or decrement an attribute value which does not yet exist, DynamoDB uses ``0`` as the initial value. For example, suppose that the item you want to update does not yet have an attribute named *itemcount*, but you decide to ``ADD`` the number ``3`` to this attribute anyway, even though it currently does not exist. DynamoDB will create the *itemcount* attribute, set its initial value to ``0``, and finally add ``3`` to it. The result will be a new *itemcount* attribute in the item, with a value of ``3``.

            
             
            * If the existing data type is a set, and if the ``Value`` is also a set, then the ``Value`` is added to the existing set. (This is a *set* operation, not mathematical addition.) For example, if the attribute value was the set ``[1,2]``, and the ``ADD`` action specified ``[3]``, then the final attribute value would be ``[1,2,3]``. An error occurs if an Add action is specified for a set attribute and the attribute type specified does not match the existing set type. Both sets must have the same primitive data type. For example, if the existing data type is a set of strings, the ``Value`` must also be a set of strings. The same holds true for number sets and binary sets.
            

           

          This action is only valid for an existing attribute whose data type is number or is a set. Do not use ``ADD`` for any other data types.

          
          

           

          If no item with the specified *Key* is found:

           

          
          * ``PUT`` - DynamoDB creates a new item with the specified primary key, and then adds the attribute.
           
          * ``DELETE`` - Nothing happens; there is no attribute to delete.
           
          * ``ADD`` - DynamoDB creates a new item with the supplied primary key and number (or set) for the attribute value. The only data types allowed are number, number set, string set or binary set.
          

          

        
      


  :type Expected: dict
  :param Expected: 

    This is a legacy parameter. Use ``ConditionExpression`` instead. For more information, see `Expected <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/LegacyConditionalParameters.Expected.html>`__ in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        Represents a condition to be compared with an attribute value. This condition can be used with ``DeleteItem``, ``PutItem``, or ``UpdateItem`` operations; if the comparison evaluates to true, the operation succeeds; if not, the operation fails. You can use ``ExpectedAttributeValue`` in one of two different ways:

         

        
        * Use ``AttributeValueList`` to specify one or more values to compare against an attribute. Use ``ComparisonOperator`` to specify how you want to perform the comparison. If the comparison evaluates to true, then the conditional operation succeeds.
         
        * Use ``Value`` to specify a value that DynamoDB will compare against an attribute. If the values match, then ``ExpectedAttributeValue`` evaluates to true and the conditional operation succeeds. Optionally, you can also set ``Exists`` to false, indicating that you *do not* expect to find the attribute value in the table. In this case, the conditional operation succeeds only if the comparison evaluates to false.
        

         

        ``Value`` and ``Exists`` are incompatible with ``AttributeValueList`` and ``ComparisonOperator``. Note that if you use both sets of parameters at once, DynamoDB will return a ``ValidationException`` exception.

        

      
        - **Value** *(valid DynamoDB type) -- *- The value of the attribute. The valid value types are listed in the :ref:`DynamoDB Reference Guide<ref_valid_dynamodb_types>`.

        
        
        - **Exists** *(boolean) --* 

          Causes DynamoDB to evaluate the value before attempting a conditional operation:

           

          
          * If ``Exists`` is ``true``, DynamoDB will check to see if that attribute value already exists in the table. If it is found, then the operation succeeds. If it is not found, the operation fails with a ``ConditionCheckFailedException``.
           
          * If ``Exists`` is ``false``, DynamoDB assumes that the attribute value does not exist in the table. If in fact the value does not exist, then the assumption is valid and the operation succeeds. If the value is found, despite the assumption that it does not exist, the operation fails with a ``ConditionCheckFailedException``.
          

           

          The default setting for ``Exists`` is ``true``. If you supply a ``Value`` all by itself, DynamoDB assumes the attribute exists: You don't have to set ``Exists`` to ``true``, because it is implied.

           

          DynamoDB returns a ``ValidationException`` if:

           

          
          * ``Exists`` is ``true`` but there is no ``Value`` to check. (You expect a value to exist, but don't specify what that value is.)
           
          * ``Exists`` is ``false`` but you also provide a ``Value``. (You cannot expect an attribute to have a value, while also expecting it not to exist.)
          

          

        
        - **ComparisonOperator** *(string) --* 

          A comparator for evaluating attributes in the ``AttributeValueList``. For example, equals, greater than, less than, etc.

           

          The following comparison operators are available:

           

          ``EQ | NE | LE | LT | GE | GT | NOT_NULL | NULL | CONTAINS | NOT_CONTAINS | BEGINS_WITH | IN | BETWEEN``

           

          The following are descriptions of each comparison operator.

           

          
          * ``EQ`` : Equal. ``EQ`` is supported for all data types, including lists and maps. ``AttributeValueList`` can contain only one ``AttributeValue`` element of type String, Number, Binary, String Set, Number Set, or Binary Set. If an item contains an ``AttributeValue`` element of a different type than the one provided in the request, the value does not match. For example, ``{"S":"6"}`` does not equal ``{"N":"6"}``. Also, ``{"N":"6"}`` does not equal ``{"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}``.
           
          * ``NE`` : Not equal. ``NE`` is supported for all data types, including lists and maps. ``AttributeValueList`` can contain only one ``AttributeValue`` of type String, Number, Binary, String Set, Number Set, or Binary Set. If an item contains an ``AttributeValue`` of a different type than the one provided in the request, the value does not match. For example, ``{"S":"6"}`` does not equal ``{"N":"6"}``. Also, ``{"N":"6"}`` does not equal ``{"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}``.
           
          * ``LE`` : Less than or equal. ``AttributeValueList`` can contain only one ``AttributeValue`` element of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If an item contains an ``AttributeValue`` element of a different type than the one provided in the request, the value does not match. For example, ``{"S":"6"}`` does not equal ``{"N":"6"}``. Also, ``{"N":"6"}`` does not compare to ``{"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}``.
           
          * ``LT`` : Less than. ``AttributeValueList`` can contain only one ``AttributeValue`` of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If an item contains an ``AttributeValue`` element of a different type than the one provided in the request, the value does not match. For example, ``{"S":"6"}`` does not equal ``{"N":"6"}``. Also, ``{"N":"6"}`` does not compare to ``{"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}``.
           
          * ``GE`` : Greater than or equal. ``AttributeValueList`` can contain only one ``AttributeValue`` element of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If an item contains an ``AttributeValue`` element of a different type than the one provided in the request, the value does not match. For example, ``{"S":"6"}`` does not equal ``{"N":"6"}``. Also, ``{"N":"6"}`` does not compare to ``{"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}``.
           
          * ``GT`` : Greater than. ``AttributeValueList`` can contain only one ``AttributeValue`` element of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If an item contains an ``AttributeValue`` element of a different type than the one provided in the request, the value does not match. For example, ``{"S":"6"}`` does not equal ``{"N":"6"}``. Also, ``{"N":"6"}`` does not compare to ``{"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}``.
           
          * ``NOT_NULL`` : The attribute exists. ``NOT_NULL`` is supported for all data types, including lists and maps. 

          .. note::

            This operator tests for the existence of an attribute, not its data type. If the data type of attribute " ``a``" is null, and you evaluate it using ``NOT_NULL``, the result is a Boolean ``true``. This result is because the attribute " ``a``" exists; its data type is not relevant to the ``NOT_NULL`` comparison operator.

          
           
          * ``NULL`` : The attribute does not exist. ``NULL`` is supported for all data types, including lists and maps. 

          .. note::

            This operator tests for the nonexistence of an attribute, not its data type. If the data type of attribute " ``a``" is null, and you evaluate it using ``NULL``, the result is a Boolean ``false``. This is because the attribute " ``a``" exists; its data type is not relevant to the ``NULL`` comparison operator.

          
           
          * ``CONTAINS`` : Checks for a subsequence, or value in a set. ``AttributeValueList`` can contain only one ``AttributeValue`` element of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If the target attribute of the comparison is of type String, then the operator checks for a substring match. If the target attribute of the comparison is of type Binary, then the operator looks for a subsequence of the target that matches the input. If the target attribute of the comparison is a set (" ``SS``", " ``NS``", or " ``BS``"), then the operator evaluates to true if it finds an exact match with any member of the set. CONTAINS is supported for lists: When evaluating " ``a CONTAINS b``", " ``a``" can be a list; however, " ``b``" cannot be a set, a map, or a list.
           
          * ``NOT_CONTAINS`` : Checks for absence of a subsequence, or absence of a value in a set. ``AttributeValueList`` can contain only one ``AttributeValue`` element of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If the target attribute of the comparison is a String, then the operator checks for the absence of a substring match. If the target attribute of the comparison is Binary, then the operator checks for the absence of a subsequence of the target that matches the input. If the target attribute of the comparison is a set (" ``SS``", " ``NS``", or " ``BS``"), then the operator evaluates to true if it *does not* find an exact match with any member of the set. NOT_CONTAINS is supported for lists: When evaluating " ``a NOT CONTAINS b``", " ``a``" can be a list; however, " ``b``" cannot be a set, a map, or a list.
           
          * ``BEGINS_WITH`` : Checks for a prefix. ``AttributeValueList`` can contain only one ``AttributeValue`` of type String or Binary (not a Number or a set type). The target attribute of the comparison must be of type String or Binary (not a Number or a set type).
           
          * ``IN`` : Checks for matching elements in a list. ``AttributeValueList`` can contain one or more ``AttributeValue`` elements of type String, Number, or Binary. These attributes are compared against an existing attribute of an item. If any elements of the input are equal to the item attribute, the expression evaluates to true.
           
          * ``BETWEEN`` : Greater than or equal to the first value, and less than or equal to the second value. ``AttributeValueList`` must contain two ``AttributeValue`` elements of the same type, either String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). A target attribute matches if the target value is greater than, or equal to, the first element and less than, or equal to, the second element. If an item contains an ``AttributeValue`` element of a different type than the one provided in the request, the value does not match. For example, ``{"S":"6"}`` does not compare to ``{"N":"6"}``. Also, ``{"N":"6"}`` does not compare to ``{"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}``
          

          

        
        - **AttributeValueList** *(list) --* 

          One or more values to evaluate against the supplied attribute. The number of values in the list depends on the ``ComparisonOperator`` being used.

           

          For type Number, value comparisons are numeric.

           

          String value comparisons for greater than, equals, or less than are based on ASCII character code values. For example, ``a`` is greater than ``A``, and ``a`` is greater than ``B``. For a list of code values, see `http\://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII_printable_characters <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII_printable_characters>`__.

           

          For Binary, DynamoDB treats each byte of the binary data as unsigned when it compares binary values.

           

          For information on specifying data types in JSON, see `JSON Data Format <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DataFormat.html>`__ in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.

          

        
          - *(valid DynamoDB type) -- *- The value of the attribute. The valid value types are listed in the :ref:`DynamoDB Reference Guide<ref_valid_dynamodb_types>`.

          
          
      
      


  :type ConditionalOperator: string
  :param ConditionalOperator: 

    This is a legacy parameter. Use ``ConditionExpression`` instead. For more information, see `ConditionalOperator <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/LegacyConditionalParameters.ConditionalOperator.html>`__ in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.

    

  
  :type ReturnValues: string
  :param ReturnValues: 

    Use ``ReturnValues`` if you want to get the item attributes as they appear before or after they are successfully updated. For ``UpdateItem``, the valid values are:

     

    
    * ``NONE`` - If ``ReturnValues`` is not specified, or if its value is ``NONE``, then nothing is returned. (This setting is the default for ``ReturnValues``.)
     
    * ``ALL_OLD`` - Returns all of the attributes of the item, as they appeared before the UpdateItem operation.
     
    * ``UPDATED_OLD`` - Returns only the updated attributes, as they appeared before the UpdateItem operation.
     
    * ``ALL_NEW`` - Returns all of the attributes of the item, as they appear after the UpdateItem operation.
     
    * ``UPDATED_NEW`` - Returns only the updated attributes, as they appear after the UpdateItem operation.
    

     

    There is no additional cost associated with requesting a return value aside from the small network and processing overhead of receiving a larger response. No read capacity units are consumed.

     

    The values returned are strongly consistent.

    

  
  :type ReturnConsumedCapacity: string
  :param ReturnConsumedCapacity: 

    Determines the level of detail about either provisioned or on-demand throughput consumption that is returned in the response:

     

    
    * ``INDEXES`` - The response includes the aggregate ``ConsumedCapacity`` for the operation, together with ``ConsumedCapacity`` for each table and secondary index that was accessed. Note that some operations, such as ``GetItem`` and ``BatchGetItem``, do not access any indexes at all. In these cases, specifying ``INDEXES`` will only return ``ConsumedCapacity`` information for table(s).
     
    * ``TOTAL`` - The response includes only the aggregate ``ConsumedCapacity`` for the operation.
     
    * ``NONE`` - No ``ConsumedCapacity`` details are included in the response.
    

    

  
  :type ReturnItemCollectionMetrics: string
  :param ReturnItemCollectionMetrics: 

    Determines whether item collection metrics are returned. If set to ``SIZE``, the response includes statistics about item collections, if any, that were modified during the operation are returned in the response. If set to ``NONE`` (the default), no statistics are returned.

    

  
  :type UpdateExpression: string
  :param UpdateExpression: 

    An expression that defines one or more attributes to be updated, the action to be performed on them, and new values for them.

     

    The following action values are available for ``UpdateExpression``.

     

    
    * ``SET`` - Adds one or more attributes and values to an item. If any of these attributes already exist, they are replaced by the new values. You can also use ``SET`` to add or subtract from an attribute that is of type Number. For example: ``SET myNum = myNum + :val`` ``SET`` supports the following functions: 

      
      * ``if_not_exists (path, operand)`` - if the item does not contain an attribute at the specified path, then ``if_not_exists`` evaluates to operand; otherwise, it evaluates to path. You can use this function to avoid overwriting an attribute that may already be present in the item.
       
      * ``list_append (operand, operand)`` - evaluates to a list with a new element added to it. You can append the new element to the start or the end of the list by reversing the order of the operands.
      

     

    These function names are case-sensitive.

    
     
    * ``REMOVE`` - Removes one or more attributes from an item.
     
    * ``ADD`` - Adds the specified value to the item, if the attribute does not already exist. If the attribute does exist, then the behavior of ``ADD`` depends on the data type of the attribute: 

      
      * If the existing attribute is a number, and if ``Value`` is also a number, then ``Value`` is mathematically added to the existing attribute. If ``Value`` is a negative number, then it is subtracted from the existing attribute. 

      .. note::

        If you use ``ADD`` to increment or decrement a number value for an item that doesn't exist before the update, DynamoDB uses ``0`` as the initial value. Similarly, if you use ``ADD`` for an existing item to increment or decrement an attribute value that doesn't exist before the update, DynamoDB uses ``0`` as the initial value. For example, suppose that the item you want to update doesn't have an attribute named ``itemcount``, but you decide to ``ADD`` the number ``3`` to this attribute anyway. DynamoDB will create the ``itemcount`` attribute, set its initial value to ``0``, and finally add ``3`` to it. The result will be a new ``itemcount`` attribute in the item, with a value of ``3``.

      
       
      * If the existing data type is a set and if ``Value`` is also a set, then ``Value`` is added to the existing set. For example, if the attribute value is the set ``[1,2]``, and the ``ADD`` action specified ``[3]``, then the final attribute value is ``[1,2,3]``. An error occurs if an ``ADD`` action is specified for a set attribute and the attribute type specified does not match the existing set type. Both sets must have the same primitive data type. For example, if the existing data type is a set of strings, the ``Value`` must also be a set of strings.
      

     

    .. warning::

      

      The ``ADD`` action only supports Number and set data types. In addition, ``ADD`` can only be used on top-level attributes, not nested attributes.

      

    
     
    * ``DELETE`` - Deletes an element from a set. If a set of values is specified, then those values are subtracted from the old set. For example, if the attribute value was the set ``[a,b,c]`` and the ``DELETE`` action specifies ``[a,c]``, then the final attribute value is ``[b]``. Specifying an empty set is an error. 

    .. warning::

      The ``DELETE`` action only supports set data types. In addition, ``DELETE`` can only be used on top-level attributes, not nested attributes.

    
    

     

    You can have many actions in a single expression, such as the following: ``SET a=:value1, b=:value2 DELETE :value3, :value4, :value5``

  :type ConditionExpression: condition from :py:class:`boto3.dynamodb.conditions.Attr` method
  :param ConditionExpression: The condition(s) an attribute(s) must meet. Valid conditions are listed in the :ref:`DynamoDB Reference Guide<ref_dynamodb_conditions>`.

  
  :type ExpressionAttributeNames: dict
  :param ExpressionAttributeNames: 

    One or more substitution tokens for attribute names in an expression. The following are some use cases for using ``ExpressionAttributeNames``:

     

    
    * To access an attribute whose name conflicts with a DynamoDB reserved word.
     
    * To create a placeholder for repeating occurrences of an attribute name in an expression.
     
    * To prevent special characters in an attribute name from being misinterpreted in an expression.
    

     

    Use the **#** character in an expression to dereference an attribute name. For example, consider the following attribute name:

     

    
    * ``Percentile``
    

     

    The name of this attribute conflicts with a reserved word, so it cannot be used directly in an expression. (For the complete list of reserved words, see `Reserved Words <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ReservedWords.html>`__ in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.) To work around this, you could specify the following for ``ExpressionAttributeNames``:

     

    
    * ``{"#P":"Percentile"}``
    

     

    You could then use this substitution in an expression, as in this example:

     

    
    * ``#P = :val``
    

     

    .. note::

      

      Tokens that begin with the **:** character are *expression attribute values*, which are placeholders for the actual value at runtime.

      

     

    For more information about expression attribute names, see `Specifying Item Attributes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Expressions.AccessingItemAttributes.html>`__ in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.

  :type ExpressionAttributeValues: dict
  :param ExpressionAttributeValues: 

    One or more values that can be substituted in an expression.

     

    Use the **:** (colon) character in an expression to dereference an attribute value. For example, suppose that you wanted to check whether the value of the ``ProductStatus`` attribute was one of the following:

     

    ``Available | Backordered | Discontinued``

     

    You would first need to specify ``ExpressionAttributeValues`` as follows:

     

    ``{ ":avail":{"S":"Available"}, ":back":{"S":"Backordered"}, ":disc":{"S":"Discontinued"} }``

     

    You could then use these values in an expression, such as this:

     

    ``ProductStatus IN (:avail, :back, :disc)``

     

    For more information on expression attribute values, see `Condition Expressions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Expressions.SpecifyingConditions.html>`__ in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    
      - *(valid DynamoDB type) -- *- The value of the attribute. The valid value types are listed in the :ref:`DynamoDB Reference Guide<ref_valid_dynamodb_types>`.

      
      


  :type ReturnValuesOnConditionCheckFailure: string
  :param ReturnValuesOnConditionCheckFailure: 

    An optional parameter that returns the item attributes for an ``UpdateItem`` operation that failed a condition check.

     

    There is no additional cost associated with requesting a return value aside from the small network and processing overhead of receiving a larger response. No read capacity units are consumed.

      - **ItemCollectionMetrics** *(dict) --* 

        Information about item collections, if any, that were affected by the ``UpdateItem`` operation. ``ItemCollectionMetrics`` is only returned if the ``ReturnItemCollectionMetrics`` parameter was specified. If the table does not have any local secondary indexes, this information is not returned in the response.

         

        Each ``ItemCollectionMetrics`` element consists of:

         

        
        * ``ItemCollectionKey`` - The partition key value of the item collection. This is the same as the partition key value of the item itself.
         
        * ``SizeEstimateRangeGB`` - An estimate of item collection size, in gigabytes. This value is a two-element array containing a lower bound and an upper bound for the estimate. The estimate includes the size of all the items in the table, plus the size of all attributes projected into all of the local secondary indexes on that table. Use this estimate to measure whether a local secondary index is approaching its size limit. The estimate is subject to change over time; therefore, do not rely on the precision or accuracy of the estimate.
        

        
        

        - **ItemCollectionKey** *(dict) --* 

          The partition key value of the item collection. This value is the same as the partition key value of the item.

        - **SizeEstimateRangeGB** *(list) --* 

          An estimate of item collection size, in gigabytes. This value is a two-element array containing a lower bound and an upper bound for the estimate. The estimate includes the size of all the items in the table, plus the size of all attributes projected into all of the local secondary indexes on that table. Use this estimate to measure whether a local secondary index is approaching its size limit.

           

          The estimate is subject to change over time; therefore, do not rely on the precision or accuracy of the estimate.
