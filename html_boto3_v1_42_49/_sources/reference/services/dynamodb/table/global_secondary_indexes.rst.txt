.. py:attribute:: DynamoDB.Table.global_secondary_indexes

  

  - *(list) --* 

    The global secondary indexes, if any, on the table. Each index is scoped to a given partition key value. Each element is composed of:

     

    
    * ``Backfilling`` - If true, then the index is currently in the backfilling phase. Backfilling occurs only when a new global secondary index is added to the table. It is the process by which DynamoDB populates the new index with data from the table. (This attribute does not appear for indexes that were created during a ``CreateTable`` operation.) You can delete an index that is being created during the ``Backfilling`` phase when ``IndexStatus`` is set to CREATING and ``Backfilling`` is true. You can't delete the index that is being created when ``IndexStatus`` is set to CREATING and ``Backfilling`` is false. (This attribute does not appear for indexes that were created during a ``CreateTable`` operation.)
     
    * ``IndexName`` - The name of the global secondary index.
     
    * ``IndexSizeBytes`` - The total size of the global secondary index, in bytes. DynamoDB updates this value approximately every six hours. Recent changes might not be reflected in this value.
     
    * ``IndexStatus`` - The current status of the global secondary index: 

      
      * ``CREATING`` - The index is being created.
       
      * ``UPDATING`` - The index is being updated.
       
      * ``DELETING`` - The index is being deleted.
       
      * ``ACTIVE`` - The index is ready for use.
      

    
     
    * ``ItemCount`` - The number of items in the global secondary index. DynamoDB updates this value approximately every six hours. Recent changes might not be reflected in this value.
     
    * ``KeySchema`` - Specifies the complete index key schema. The attribute names in the key schema must be between 1 and 255 characters (inclusive). The key schema must begin with the same partition key as the table.
     
    * ``Projection`` - Specifies attributes that are copied (projected) from the table into the index. These are in addition to the primary key attributes and index key attributes, which are automatically projected. Each attribute specification is composed of: 

      
      * ``ProjectionType`` - One of the following: 

        
        * ``KEYS_ONLY`` - Only the index and primary keys are projected into the index.
         
        * ``INCLUDE`` - In addition to the attributes described in ``KEYS_ONLY``, the secondary index will include other non-key attributes that you specify.
         
        * ``ALL`` - All of the table attributes are projected into the index.
        

      
       
      * ``NonKeyAttributes`` - A list of one or more non-key attribute names that are projected into the secondary index. The total count of attributes provided in ``NonKeyAttributes``, summed across all of the secondary indexes, must not exceed 100. If you project the same attribute into two different indexes, this counts as two distinct attributes when determining the total. This limit only applies when you specify the ProjectionType of ``INCLUDE``. You still can specify the ProjectionType of ``ALL`` to project all attributes from the source table, even if the table has more than 100 attributes.
      

    
     
    * ``ProvisionedThroughput`` - The provisioned throughput settings for the global secondary index, consisting of read and write capacity units, along with data about increases and decreases.
    

     

    If the table is in the ``DELETING`` state, no information about indexes will be returned.

    
    

    - *(dict) --* 

      Represents the properties of a global secondary index.

      
      

      - **IndexName** *(string) --* 

        The name of the global secondary index.

        
      

      - **KeySchema** *(list) --* 

        The complete key schema for a global secondary index, which consists of one or more pairs of attribute names and key types:

         

        
        * ``HASH`` - partition key
         
        * ``RANGE`` - sort key
        

         

        .. note::

          

          The partition key of an item is also known as its *hash attribute*. The term "hash attribute" derives from DynamoDB's usage of an internal hash function to evenly distribute data items across partitions, based on their partition key values.

           

          The sort key of an item is also known as its *range attribute*. The term "range attribute" derives from the way DynamoDB stores items with the same partition key physically close together, in sorted order by the sort key value.

          

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          Represents *a single element* of a key schema. A key schema specifies the attributes that make up the primary key of a table, or the key attributes of an index.

           

          A ``KeySchemaElement`` represents exactly one attribute of the primary key. For example, a simple primary key would be represented by one ``KeySchemaElement`` (for the partition key). A composite primary key would require one ``KeySchemaElement`` for the partition key, and another ``KeySchemaElement`` for the sort key.

           

          A ``KeySchemaElement`` must be a scalar, top-level attribute (not a nested attribute). The data type must be one of String, Number, or Binary. The attribute cannot be nested within a List or a Map.

          
          

          - **AttributeName** *(string) --* 

            The name of a key attribute.

            
          

          - **KeyType** *(string) --* 

            The role that this key attribute will assume:

             

            
            * ``HASH`` - partition key
             
            * ``RANGE`` - sort key
            

             

            .. note::

              

              The partition key of an item is also known as its *hash attribute*. The term "hash attribute" derives from DynamoDB's usage of an internal hash function to evenly distribute data items across partitions, based on their partition key values.

               

              The sort key of an item is also known as its *range attribute*. The term "range attribute" derives from the way DynamoDB stores items with the same partition key physically close together, in sorted order by the sort key value.

              

            
      
    
      

      - **Projection** *(dict) --* 

        Represents attributes that are copied (projected) from the table into the global secondary index. These are in addition to the primary key attributes and index key attributes, which are automatically projected.

        
        

        - **ProjectionType** *(string) --* 

          The set of attributes that are projected into the index:

           

          
          * ``KEYS_ONLY`` - Only the index and primary keys are projected into the index.
           
          * ``INCLUDE`` - In addition to the attributes described in ``KEYS_ONLY``, the secondary index will include other non-key attributes that you specify.
           
          * ``ALL`` - All of the table attributes are projected into the index.
          

           

          When using the DynamoDB console, ``ALL`` is selected by default.

          
        

        - **NonKeyAttributes** *(list) --* 

          Represents the non-key attribute names which will be projected into the index.

           

          For global and local secondary indexes, the total count of ``NonKeyAttributes`` summed across all of the secondary indexes, must not exceed 100. If you project the same attribute into two different indexes, this counts as two distinct attributes when determining the total. This limit only applies when you specify the ProjectionType of ``INCLUDE``. You still can specify the ProjectionType of ``ALL`` to project all attributes from the source table, even if the table has more than 100 attributes.

          
          

          - *(string) --* 
      
    
      

      - **IndexStatus** *(string) --* 

        The current state of the global secondary index:

         

        
        * ``CREATING`` - The index is being created.
         
        * ``UPDATING`` - The index is being updated.
         
        * ``DELETING`` - The index is being deleted.
         
        * ``ACTIVE`` - The index is ready for use.
        

        
      

      - **Backfilling** *(boolean) --* 

        Indicates whether the index is currently backfilling. *Backfilling* is the process of reading items from the table and determining whether they can be added to the index. (Not all items will qualify: For example, a partition key cannot have any duplicate values.) If an item can be added to the index, DynamoDB will do so. After all items have been processed, the backfilling operation is complete and ``Backfilling`` is false.

         

        You can delete an index that is being created during the ``Backfilling`` phase when ``IndexStatus`` is set to CREATING and ``Backfilling`` is true. You can't delete the index that is being created when ``IndexStatus`` is set to CREATING and ``Backfilling`` is false.

         

        .. note::

          

          For indexes that were created during a ``CreateTable`` operation, the ``Backfilling`` attribute does not appear in the ``DescribeTable`` output.

          

        
      

      - **ProvisionedThroughput** *(dict) --* 

        Represents the provisioned throughput settings for the specified global secondary index.

         

        For current minimum and maximum provisioned throughput values, see `Service, Account, and Table Quotas <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Limits.html>`__ in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.

        
        

        - **LastIncreaseDateTime** *(datetime) --* 

          The date and time of the last provisioned throughput increase for this table.

          
        

        - **LastDecreaseDateTime** *(datetime) --* 

          The date and time of the last provisioned throughput decrease for this table.

          
        

        - **NumberOfDecreasesToday** *(integer) --* 

          The number of provisioned throughput decreases for this table during this UTC calendar day. For current maximums on provisioned throughput decreases, see `Service, Account, and Table Quotas <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Limits.html>`__ in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.

          
        

        - **ReadCapacityUnits** *(integer) --* 

          The maximum number of strongly consistent reads consumed per second before DynamoDB returns a ``ThrottlingException``. Eventually consistent reads require less effort than strongly consistent reads, so a setting of 50 ``ReadCapacityUnits`` per second provides 100 eventually consistent ``ReadCapacityUnits`` per second.

          
        

        - **WriteCapacityUnits** *(integer) --* 

          The maximum number of writes consumed per second before DynamoDB returns a ``ThrottlingException``.

          
    
      

      - **IndexSizeBytes** *(integer) --* 

        The total size of the specified index, in bytes. DynamoDB updates this value approximately every six hours. Recent changes might not be reflected in this value.

        
      

      - **ItemCount** *(integer) --* 

        The number of items in the specified index. DynamoDB updates this value approximately every six hours. Recent changes might not be reflected in this value.

        
      

      - **IndexArn** *(string) --* 

        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies the index.

        
      

      - **OnDemandThroughput** *(dict) --* 

        The maximum number of read and write units for the specified global secondary index. If you use this parameter, you must specify ``MaxReadRequestUnits``, ``MaxWriteRequestUnits``, or both.

        
        

        - **MaxReadRequestUnits** *(integer) --* 

          Maximum number of read request units for the specified table.

           

          To specify a maximum ``OnDemandThroughput`` on your table, set the value of ``MaxReadRequestUnits`` as greater than or equal to 1. To remove the maximum ``OnDemandThroughput`` that is currently set on your table, set the value of ``MaxReadRequestUnits`` to -1.

          
        

        - **MaxWriteRequestUnits** *(integer) --* 

          Maximum number of write request units for the specified table.

           

          To specify a maximum ``OnDemandThroughput`` on your table, set the value of ``MaxWriteRequestUnits`` as greater than or equal to 1. To remove the maximum ``OnDemandThroughput`` that is currently set on your table, set the value of ``MaxWriteRequestUnits`` to -1.

          
    
      

      - **WarmThroughput** *(dict) --* 

        Represents the warm throughput value (in read units per second and write units per second) for the specified secondary index.

        
        

        - **ReadUnitsPerSecond** *(integer) --* 

          Represents warm throughput read units per second value for a global secondary index.

          
        

        - **WriteUnitsPerSecond** *(integer) --* 

          Represents warm throughput write units per second value for a global secondary index.

          
        

        - **Status** *(string) --* 

          Represents the warm throughput status being created or updated on a global secondary index. The status can only be ``UPDATING`` or ``ACTIVE``.
