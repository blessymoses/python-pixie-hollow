  - *(dict) --* 

    The current DynamoDB Streams configuration for the table.

    
    

    - **StreamEnabled** *(boolean) --* 

      Indicates whether DynamoDB Streams is enabled (true) or disabled (false) on the table.

      
    

    - **StreamViewType** *(string) --* 

      When an item in the table is modified, ``StreamViewType`` determines what information is written to the stream for this table. Valid values for ``StreamViewType`` are:

       

      
      * ``KEYS_ONLY`` - Only the key attributes of the modified item are written to the stream.
       
      * ``NEW_IMAGE`` - The entire item, as it appears after it was modified, is written to the stream.
       
      * ``OLD_IMAGE`` - The entire item, as it appeared before it was modified, is written to the stream.
       
      * ``NEW_AND_OLD_IMAGES`` - Both the new and the old item images of the item are written to the stream.
