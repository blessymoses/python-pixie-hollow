.. py:method:: Rekognition.Client.create_stream_processor(**kwargs)

  

  Creates an Amazon Rekognition stream processor that you can use to detect and recognize faces or to detect labels in a streaming video.

   

  Amazon Rekognition Video is a consumer of live video from Amazon Kinesis Video Streams. There are two different settings for stream processors in Amazon Rekognition: detecting faces and detecting labels.

   

  
  * If you are creating a stream processor for detecting faces, you provide as input a Kinesis video stream ( ``Input``) and a Kinesis data stream ( ``Output``) stream for receiving the output. You must use the ``FaceSearch`` option in ``Settings``, specifying the collection that contains the faces you want to recognize. After you have finished analyzing a streaming video, use  StopStreamProcessor to stop processing.
   
  * If you are creating a stream processor to detect labels, you provide as input a Kinesis video stream ( ``Input``), Amazon S3 bucket information ( ``Output``), and an Amazon SNS topic ARN ( ``NotificationChannel``). You can also provide a KMS key ID to encrypt the data sent to your Amazon S3 bucket. You specify what you want to detect by using the ``ConnectedHome`` option in settings, and selecting one of the following: ``PERSON``, ``PET``, ``PACKAGE``, ``ALL`` You can also specify where in the frame you want Amazon Rekognition to monitor with ``RegionsOfInterest``. When you run the  StartStreamProcessor operation on a label detection stream processor, you input start and stop information to determine the length of the processing time.
  

   

  Use ``Name`` to assign an identifier for the stream processor. You use ``Name`` to manage the stream processor. For example, you can start processing the source video by calling  StartStreamProcessor with the ``Name`` field.

   

  This operation requires permissions to perform the ``rekognition:CreateStreamProcessor`` action. If you want to tag your stream processor, you also require permission to perform the ``rekognition:TagResource`` operation.

    - **ConnectedHome** *(dict) --* 

      Label detection settings to use on a streaming video. Defining the settings is required in the request parameter for  CreateStreamProcessor. Including this setting in the ``CreateStreamProcessor`` request enables you to use the stream processor for label detection. You can then select what you want the stream processor to detect, such as people or pets. When the stream processor has started, one notification is sent for each object class specified. For example, if packages and pets are selected, one SNS notification is published the first time a package is detected and one SNS notification is published the first time a pet is detected, as well as an end-of-session summary.

      

    
      - **Labels** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]**

  :type NotificationChannel: dict
  :param NotificationChannel: 

    The Amazon Simple Notification Service topic to which Amazon Rekognition publishes the object detection results and completion status of a video analysis operation.

     

    Amazon Rekognition publishes a notification the first time an object of interest or a person is detected in the video stream. For example, if Amazon Rekognition detects a person at second 2, a pet at second 4, and a person again at second 5, Amazon Rekognition sends 2 object class detected notifications, one for a person at second 2 and one for a pet at second 4.

     

    Amazon Rekognition also publishes an an end-of-session notification with a summary when the stream processing session is complete.

  :type KmsKeyId: string
  :param KmsKeyId: 

    The identifier for your AWS Key Management Service key (AWS KMS key). This is an optional parameter for label detection stream processors and should not be used to create a face search stream processor. You can supply the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of your KMS key, the ID of your KMS key, an alias for your KMS key, or an alias ARN. The key is used to encrypt results and data published to your Amazon S3 bucket, which includes image frames and hero images. Your source images are unaffected.

    

  
  :type RegionsOfInterest: list
  :param RegionsOfInterest: 

    Specifies locations in the frames where Amazon Rekognition checks for objects or people. You can specify up to 10 regions of interest, and each region has either a polygon or a bounding box. This is an optional parameter for label detection stream processors and should not be used to create a face search stream processor.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      Specifies a location within the frame that Rekognition checks for objects of interest such as text, labels, or faces. It uses a ``BoundingBox`` or ``Polygon`` to set a region of the screen.

       

      A word, face, or label is included in the region if it is more than half in that region. If there is more than one region, the word, face, or label is compared with all regions of the screen. Any object of interest that is more than half in a region is kept in the results.

      

    
      - **BoundingBox** *(dict) --* 

        The box representing a region of interest on screen.

        

      
        - **Width** *(float) --* 

          Width of the bounding box as a ratio of the overall image width.

          

        
        - **Height** *(float) --* 

          Height of the bounding box as a ratio of the overall image height.

          

        
        - **Left** *(float) --* 

          Left coordinate of the bounding box as a ratio of overall image width.

          

        
        - **Top** *(float) --* 

          Top coordinate of the bounding box as a ratio of overall image height.

          

        
      
      - **Polygon** *(list) --* 

        Specifies a shape made up of up to 10 ``Point`` objects to define a region of interest.

        

      
        - *(dict) --* 

          The X and Y coordinates of a point on an image or video frame. The X and Y values are ratios of the overall image size or video resolution. For example, if an input image is 700x200 and the values are X=0.5 and Y=0.25, then the point is at the (350,50) pixel coordinate on the image.

           

          An array of ``Point`` objects makes up a ``Polygon``. A ``Polygon`` is returned by  DetectText and by  DetectCustomLabels ``Polygon`` represents a fine-grained polygon around a detected item. For more information, see Geometry in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.

          

        
          - **X** *(float) --* 

            The value of the X coordinate for a point on a ``Polygon``.

            

          
          - **Y** *(float) --* 

            The value of the Y coordinate for a point on a ``Polygon``.

            

          
        
    
    

  :type DataSharingPreference: dict
  :param DataSharingPreference: 

    Shows whether you are sharing data with Rekognition to improve model performance. You can choose this option at the account level or on a per-stream basis. Note that if you opt out at the account level this setting is ignored on individual streams.
