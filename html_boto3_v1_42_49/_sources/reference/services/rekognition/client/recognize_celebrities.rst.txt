.. py:method:: Rekognition.Client.recognize_celebrities(**kwargs)

  

  Returns an array of celebrities recognized in the input image. For more information, see Recognizing celebrities in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.

   

  ``RecognizeCelebrities`` returns the 64 largest faces in the image. It lists the recognized celebrities in the ``CelebrityFaces`` array and any unrecognized faces in the ``UnrecognizedFaces`` array. ``RecognizeCelebrities`` doesn't return celebrities whose faces aren't among the largest 64 faces in the image.

   

  For each celebrity recognized, ``RecognizeCelebrities`` returns a ``Celebrity`` object. The ``Celebrity`` object contains the celebrity name, ID, URL links to additional information, match confidence, and a ``ComparedFace`` object that you can use to locate the celebrity's face on the image.

   

  Amazon Rekognition doesn't retain information about which images a celebrity has been recognized in. Your application must store this information and use the ``Celebrity`` ID property as a unique identifier for the celebrity. If you don't store the celebrity name or additional information URLs returned by ``RecognizeCelebrities``, you will need the ID to identify the celebrity in a call to the  GetCelebrityInfo operation.

   

  You pass the input image either as base64-encoded image bytes or as a reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes is not supported. The image must be either a PNG or JPEG formatted file.

   

  For an example, see Recognizing celebrities in an image in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.

   

  This operation requires permissions to perform the ``rekognition:RecognizeCelebrities`` operation.

    The input image as base64-encoded bytes or an S3 object. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing base64-encoded image bytes is not supported.

     

    If you are using an AWS SDK to call Amazon Rekognition, you might not need to base64-encode image bytes passed using the ``Bytes`` field. For more information, see Images in the Amazon Rekognition developer guide.

    

  
    - **Bytes** *(bytes) --* 

      Blob of image bytes up to 5 MBs. Note that the maximum image size you can pass to ``DetectCustomLabels`` is 4MB.

      

    
    - **S3Object** *(dict) --* 

      Identifies an S3 object as the image source.

        Name of the S3 bucket.

        

      
      - **Name** *(string) --* 

        S3 object key name.

        

      
      - **Version** *(string) --* 

        If the bucket is versioning enabled, you can specify the object version.

            Indicates the pose of the face as determined by its pitch, roll, and yaw.

            
            

            - **Roll** *(float) --* 

              Value representing the face rotation on the roll axis.

              
            

            - **Yaw** *(float) --* 

              Value representing the face rotation on the yaw axis.

              
            

            - **Pitch** *(float) --* 

              Value representing the face rotation on the pitch axis.

              
        
          

          - **Quality** *(dict) --* 

            Identifies face image brightness and sharpness.

            
            

            - **Brightness** *(float) --* 

              Value representing brightness of the face. The service returns a value between 0 and 100 (inclusive). A higher value indicates a brighter face image.

              
            

            - **Sharpness** *(float) --* 

              Value representing sharpness of the face. The service returns a value between 0 and 100 (inclusive). A higher value indicates a sharper face image.

              
        
          

          - **Emotions** *(list) --* 

            The emotions that appear to be expressed on the face, and the confidence level in the determination. Valid values include "Happy", "Sad", "Angry", "Confused", "Disgusted", "Surprised", "Calm", "Unknown", and "Fear".

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

              The API returns a prediction of an emotion based on a person's facial expressions, along with the confidence level for the predicted emotion. It is not a determination of the person’s internal emotional state and should not be used in such a way. For example, a person pretending to have a sad face might not be sad emotionally. The API is not intended to be used, and you may not use it, in a manner that violates the EU Artificial Intelligence Act or any other applicable law.

              
              

              - **Type** *(string) --* 

                Type of emotion detected.

                
              

              - **Confidence** *(float) --* 

                Level of confidence in the determination.

                
          
        
          

          - **Smile** *(dict) --* 

            Indicates whether or not the face is smiling, and the confidence level in the determination.

            
            

            - **Value** *(boolean) --* 

              Boolean value that indicates whether the face is smiling or not.

              
            

            - **Confidence** *(float) --* 

              Level of confidence in the determination.

              
        
      
    
      

      - **OrientationCorrection** *(string) --* 

        .. note::

          

          Support for estimating image orientation using the the OrientationCorrection field has ceased as of August 2021. Any returned values for this field included in an API response will always be NULL.

          

         

        The orientation of the input image (counterclockwise direction). If your application displays the image, you can use this value to correct the orientation. The bounding box coordinates returned in ``CelebrityFaces`` and ``UnrecognizedFaces`` represent face locations before the image orientation is corrected.

         

        .. note::

          

          If the input image is in .jpeg format, it might contain exchangeable image (Exif) metadata that includes the image's orientation. If so, and the Exif metadata for the input image populates the orientation field, the value of ``OrientationCorrection`` is null. The ``CelebrityFaces`` and ``UnrecognizedFaces`` bounding box coordinates represent face locations after Exif metadata is used to correct the image orientation. Images in .png format don't contain Exif metadata.
