.. py:method:: LexModelsV2.Client.list_aggregated_utterances(**kwargs)

  

  Provides a list of utterances that users have sent to the bot.

   

  Utterances are aggregated by the text of the utterance. For example, all instances where customers used the phrase "I want to order pizza" are aggregated into the same line in the response.

   

  You can see both detected utterances and missed utterances. A detected utterance is where the bot properly recognized the utterance and activated the associated intent. A missed utterance was not recognized by the bot and didn't activate an intent.

   

  Utterances can be aggregated for a bot alias or for a bot version, but not both at the same time.

   

  Utterances statistics are not generated under the following conditions:

   

  
  * The ``childDirected`` field was set to true when the bot was created.
   
  * You are using slot obfuscation with one or more slots.
   
  * You opted out of participating in improving Amazon Lex.

        - *(dict) --* 

          Provides summary information for aggregated utterances. The ``ListAggregatedUtterances`` operations combines all instances of the same utterance into a single aggregated summary.

            The number of times that the utterance was missed by Amazon Lex An utterance is missed when it doesn't activate an intent or slot.

            
          

          - **utteranceFirstRecordedInAggregationDuration** *(datetime) --* 

            The date and time that the utterance was first recorded in the time window for aggregation. An utterance may have been sent to Amazon Lex before that time, but only utterances within the time window are counted.

            
          

          - **utteranceLastRecordedInAggregationDuration** *(datetime) --* 

            The last date and time that an utterance was recorded in the time window for aggregation. An utterance may be sent to Amazon Lex after that time, but only utterances within the time window are counted.

            
          

          - **containsDataFromDeletedResources** *(boolean) --* 

            Aggregated utterance data may contain utterances from versions of your bot that have since been deleted. When the aggregated contains this kind of data, this field is set to true.
