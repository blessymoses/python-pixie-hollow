.. py:method:: LexModelsV2.Client.list_intent_stage_metrics(**kwargs)

  

  Retrieves summary metrics for the stages within intents in your bot. The following fields are required:

   

  
  * ``metrics`` – A list of `AnalyticsIntentStageMetric <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lexv2/latest/APIReference/API_AnalyticsIntentStageMetric.html>`__ objects. In each object, use the ``name`` field to specify the metric to calculate, the ``statistic`` field to specify whether to calculate the ``Sum``, ``Average``, or ``Max`` number, and the ``order`` field to specify whether to sort the results in ``Ascending`` or ``Descending`` order.
   
  * ``startDateTime`` and ``endDateTime`` – Define a time range for which you want to retrieve results.
  

   

  Of the optional fields, you can organize the results in the following ways:

   

  
  * Use the ``filters`` field to filter the results, the ``groupBy`` field to specify categories by which to group the results, and the ``binBy`` field to specify time intervals by which to group the results.
   
  * Use the ``maxResults`` field to limit the number of results to return in a single response and the ``nextToken`` field to return the next batch of results if the response does not return the full set of results.
  

   

  Note that an ``order`` field exists in both ``binBy`` and ``metrics``. You can only specify one ``order`` in a given request.

        An array containing the values of the category by which to apply the operator to filter the results. You can provide multiple values if the operator is ``EQ`` or ``CO``. If you provide multiple values, you filter for results that equal/contain any of the values. For example, if the ``name``, ``operator``, and ``values`` fields are ``Modality``, ``EQ``, and ``[Speech, Text]``, the operation filters for results where the modality was either ``Speech`` or ``Text``.

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
    
    

  :type maxResults: integer
  :param maxResults: 

    The maximum number of results to return in each page of results. If there are fewer results than the maximum page size, only the actual number of results are returned.

    

  
  :type nextToken: string
  :param nextToken: 

    If the response from the ListIntentStageMetrics operation contains more results than specified in the maxResults parameter, a token is returned in the response.

     

    Use the returned token in the nextToken parameter of a ListIntentStageMetrics request to return the next page of results. For a complete set of results, call the ListIntentStageMetrics operation until the nextToken returned in the response is null.
