.. py:method:: DataSync.Client.create_location_object_storage(**kwargs)

  

  Creates a transfer *location* for an object storage system. DataSync can use this location as a source or destination for transferring data. You can make transfers with or without a `DataSync agent <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/do-i-need-datasync-agent.html#when-agent-required>`__.

   

  Before you begin, make sure that you understand the `prerequisites <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/create-object-location.html#create-object-location-prerequisites>`__ for DataSync to work with object storage systems.

        }
    )
    
  :type ServerHostname: string
  :param ServerHostname: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies the domain name or IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) of the object storage server that your DataSync agent connects to.

    

  
  :type ServerPort: integer
  :param ServerPort: 

    Specifies the port that your object storage server accepts inbound network traffic on (for example, port 443).

    

  
  :type ServerProtocol: string
  :param ServerProtocol: 

    Specifies the protocol that your object storage server uses to communicate. If not specified, the default value is ``HTTPS``.

    

  
  :type Subdirectory: string
  :param Subdirectory: 

    Specifies the object prefix for your object storage server. If this is a source location, DataSync only copies objects with this prefix. If this is a destination location, DataSync writes all objects with this prefix.

    

  
  :type BucketName: string
  :param BucketName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies the name of the object storage bucket involved in the transfer.

    

  
  :type AccessKey: string
  :param AccessKey: 

    Specifies the access key (for example, a user name) if credentials are required to authenticate with the object storage server.

    

  
  :type SecretKey: string
  :param SecretKey: 

    Specifies the secret key (for example, a password) if credentials are required to authenticate with the object storage server.

     

    .. note::

      

      If you provide a secret using ``SecretKey``, but do not provide secret configuration details using ``CmkSecretConfig`` or ``CustomSecretConfig``, then DataSync stores the token using your Amazon Web Services account's Secrets Manager secret.

      

    

  
  :type AgentArns: list
  :param AgentArns: 

    (Optional) Specifies the Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the DataSync agents that can connect with your object storage system. If you are setting up an agentless cross-cloud transfer, you do not need to specify a value for this parameter.

     

    .. note::

      

      Make sure you configure this parameter correctly when you first create your storage location. You cannot add or remove agents from a storage location after you create it.

      

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type Tags: list
  :param Tags: 

    Specifies the key-value pair that represents a tag that you want to add to the resource. Tags can help you manage, filter, and search for your resources. We recommend creating a name tag for your location.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      A key-value pair representing a single tag that's been applied to an Amazon Web Services resource.

      

    
      - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The key for an Amazon Web Services resource tag.

        

      
      - **Value** *(string) --* 

        The value for an Amazon Web Services resource tag.

        

      
    

  :type ServerCertificate: bytes
  :param ServerCertificate: 

    Specifies a certificate chain for DataSync to authenticate with your object storage system if the system uses a private or self-signed certificate authority (CA). You must specify a single ``.pem`` file with a full certificate chain (for example, ``file:///home/user/.ssh/object_storage_certificates.pem``).

     

    The certificate chain might include:

     

    
    * The object storage system's certificate
     
    * All intermediate certificates (if there are any)
     
    * The root certificate of the signing CA
    

     

    You can concatenate your certificates into a ``.pem`` file (which can be up to 32768 bytes before base64 encoding). The following example ``cat`` command creates an ``object_storage_certificates.pem`` file that includes three certificates:

     

    ``cat object_server_certificate.pem intermediate_certificate.pem ca_root_certificate.pem > object_storage_certificates.pem``

     

    To use this parameter, configure ``ServerProtocol`` to ``HTTPS``.

    

  
  :type CmkSecretConfig: dict
  :param CmkSecretConfig: 

    Specifies configuration information for a DataSync-managed secret, which includes the ``SecretKey`` that DataSync uses to access a specific object storage location, with a customer-managed KMS key.

     

    When you include this parameter as part of a ``CreateLocationObjectStorage`` request, you provide only the KMS key ARN. DataSync uses this KMS key together with the value you specify for the ``SecretKey`` parameter to create a DataSync-managed secret to store the location access credentials.

     

    Make sure that DataSync has permission to access the KMS key that you specify.

     

    .. note::

      

      You can use either ``CmkSecretConfig`` (with ``SecretKey``) or ``CustomSecretConfig`` (without ``SecretKey``) to provide credentials for a ``CreateLocationObjectStorage`` request. Do not provide both parameters for the same request.

      

    

  
    - **SecretArn** *(string) --* 

      Specifies the ARN for the DataSync-managed Secrets Manager secret that that is used to access a specific storage location. This property is generated by DataSync and is read-only. DataSync encrypts this secret with the KMS key that you specify for ``KmsKeyArn``.

      

    
    - **KmsKeyArn** *(string) --* 

      Specifies the ARN for the customer-managed KMS key that DataSync uses to encrypt the DataSync-managed secret stored for ``SecretArn``. DataSync provides this key to Secrets Manager.

      

    
  
  :type CustomSecretConfig: dict
  :param CustomSecretConfig: 

    Specifies configuration information for a customer-managed Secrets Manager secret where the secret key for a specific object storage location is stored in plain text, in Secrets Manager. This configuration includes the secret ARN, and the ARN for an IAM role that provides access to the secret.

     

    .. note::

      

      You can use either ``CmkSecretConfig`` (with ``SecretKey``) or ``CustomSecretConfig`` (without ``SecretKey``) to provide credentials for a ``CreateLocationObjectStorage`` request. Do not provide both parameters for the same request.

      

    

  
    - **SecretArn** *(string) --* 

      Specifies the ARN for an Secrets Manager secret.

      

    
    - **SecretAccessRoleArn** *(string) --* 

      Specifies the ARN for the Identity and Access Management role that DataSync uses to access the secret specified for ``SecretArn``.
