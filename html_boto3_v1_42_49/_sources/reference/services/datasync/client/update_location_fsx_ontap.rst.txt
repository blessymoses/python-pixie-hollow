        Subdirectory='string'
    )
    
  :type LocationArn: string
  :param LocationArn: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the FSx for ONTAP transfer location that you're updating.

    

  
  :type Protocol: dict
  :param Protocol: 

    Specifies the data transfer protocol that DataSync uses to access your Amazon FSx file system.

    

  
    - **NFS** *(dict) --* 

      Specifies the Network File System (NFS) protocol configuration that DataSync uses to access your FSx for OpenZFS file system or FSx for ONTAP file system's storage virtual machine (SVM).

      

    
      - **MountOptions** *(dict) --* 

        Specifies how DataSync can access a location using the NFS protocol.

        

      
        - **Version** *(string) --* 

          Specifies the NFS version that you want DataSync to use when mounting your NFS share. If the server refuses to use the version specified, the task fails.

           

          You can specify the following options:

           

          
          * ``AUTOMATIC`` (default): DataSync chooses NFS version 4.1.
           
          * ``NFS3``: Stateless protocol version that allows for asynchronous writes on the server.
           
          * ``NFSv4_0``: Stateful, firewall-friendly protocol version that supports delegations and pseudo file systems.
           
          * ``NFSv4_1``: Stateful protocol version that supports sessions, directory delegations, and parallel data processing. NFS version 4.1 also includes all features available in version 4.0.
          

           

          .. note::

            

            DataSync currently only supports NFS version 3 with Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP locations.

            

          

        
      
    
    - **SMB** *(dict) --* 

      Specifies the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol configuration that DataSync uses to access your FSx for ONTAP file system's storage virtual machine (SVM).

      

    
      - **Domain** *(string) --* 

        Specifies the name of the Windows domain that your storage virtual machine (SVM) belongs to.

         

        If you have multiple Active Directory domains in your environment, configuring this parameter makes sure that DataSync connects to the right SVM.

        

      
      - **MountOptions** *(dict) --* 

        Specifies the version of the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol that DataSync uses to access an SMB file server.

        

      
        - **Version** *(string) --* 

          By default, DataSync automatically chooses an SMB protocol version based on negotiation with your SMB file server. You also can configure DataSync to use a specific SMB version, but we recommend doing this only if DataSync has trouble negotiating with the SMB file server automatically.

           

          These are the following options for configuring the SMB version:

           

          
          * ``AUTOMATIC`` (default): DataSync and the SMB file server negotiate the highest version of SMB that they mutually support between 2.1 and 3.1.1. This is the recommended option. If you instead choose a specific version that your file server doesn't support, you may get an ``Operation Not Supported`` error.
           
          * ``SMB3``: Restricts the protocol negotiation to only SMB version 3.0.2.
           
          * ``SMB2``: Restricts the protocol negotiation to only SMB version 2.1.
           
          * ``SMB2_0``: Restricts the protocol negotiation to only SMB version 2.0.
           
          * ``SMB1``: Restricts the protocol negotiation to only SMB version 1.0. 

          .. note::

            The ``SMB1`` option isn't available when `creating an Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP location <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/API_CreateLocationFsxOntap.html>`__.

          
          

          

        
      
      - **Password** *(string) --* 

        Specifies the password of a user who has permission to access your SVM.

        

      
      - **User** *(string) --* 

        Specifies a user that can mount and access the files, folders, and metadata in your SVM.

         

        For information about choosing a user with the right level of access for your transfer, see `Using the SMB protocol <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/create-ontap-location.html#create-ontap-location-smb>`__.

        

      
    
  
  :type Subdirectory: string
  :param Subdirectory: 

    Specifies a path to the file share in the storage virtual machine (SVM) where you want to transfer data to or from.

     

    You can specify a junction path (also known as a mount point), qtree path (for NFS file shares), or share name (for SMB file shares). For example, your mount path might be ``/vol1``, ``/vol1/tree1``, or ``/share1``.

     

    .. note::

      

      Don't specify a junction path in the SVM's root volume. For more information, see `Managing FSx for ONTAP storage virtual machines <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/managing-svms.html>`__ in the *Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP User Guide*.
