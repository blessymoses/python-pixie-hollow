.. py:method:: DataSync.Client.create_location_fsx_ontap(**kwargs)

  

  Creates a transfer *location* for an Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file system. DataSync can use this location as a source or destination for transferring data.

   

  Before you begin, make sure that you understand how DataSync `accesses FSx for ONTAP file systems <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/create-ontap-location.html#create-ontap-location-access>`__.

    )
    
  :type Protocol: dict
  :param Protocol: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies the data transfer protocol that DataSync uses to access your Amazon FSx file system.

    

  
    - **NFS** *(dict) --* 

      Specifies the Network File System (NFS) protocol configuration that DataSync uses to access your FSx for OpenZFS file system or FSx for ONTAP file system's storage virtual machine (SVM).

      

    
      - **MountOptions** *(dict) --* 

        Specifies how DataSync can access a location using the NFS protocol.

        

      
        - **Version** *(string) --* 

          Specifies the NFS version that you want DataSync to use when mounting your NFS share. If the server refuses to use the version specified, the task fails.

           

          You can specify the following options:

           

          
          * ``AUTOMATIC`` (default): DataSync chooses NFS version 4.1.
           
          * ``NFS3``: Stateless protocol version that allows for asynchronous writes on the server.
           
          * ``NFSv4_0``: Stateful, firewall-friendly protocol version that supports delegations and pseudo file systems.
           
          * ``NFSv4_1``: Stateful protocol version that supports sessions, directory delegations, and parallel data processing. NFS version 4.1 also includes all features available in version 4.0.
          

           

          .. note::

            

            DataSync currently only supports NFS version 3 with Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP locations.

            

          

        
      
    
    - **SMB** *(dict) --* 

      Specifies the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol configuration that DataSync uses to access your FSx for ONTAP file system's SVM.

      

    
      - **Domain** *(string) --* 

        Specifies the name of the Windows domain that your storage virtual machine (SVM) belongs to.

         

        If you have multiple domains in your environment, configuring this setting makes sure that DataSync connects to the right SVM.

         

        If you have multiple Active Directory domains in your environment, configuring this parameter makes sure that DataSync connects to the right SVM.

        

      
      - **MountOptions** *(dict) --* 

        Specifies the version of the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol that DataSync uses to access an SMB file server.

        

      
        - **Version** *(string) --* 

          By default, DataSync automatically chooses an SMB protocol version based on negotiation with your SMB file server. You also can configure DataSync to use a specific SMB version, but we recommend doing this only if DataSync has trouble negotiating with the SMB file server automatically.

           

          These are the following options for configuring the SMB version:

           

          
          * ``AUTOMATIC`` (default): DataSync and the SMB file server negotiate the highest version of SMB that they mutually support between 2.1 and 3.1.1. This is the recommended option. If you instead choose a specific version that your file server doesn't support, you may get an ``Operation Not Supported`` error.
           
          * ``SMB3``: Restricts the protocol negotiation to only SMB version 3.0.2.
           
          * ``SMB2``: Restricts the protocol negotiation to only SMB version 2.1.
           
          * ``SMB2_0``: Restricts the protocol negotiation to only SMB version 2.0.
           
          * ``SMB1``: Restricts the protocol negotiation to only SMB version 1.0. 

          .. note::

            The ``SMB1`` option isn't available when `creating an Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP location <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/API_CreateLocationFsxOntap.html>`__.

          
          

          

        
      
      - **Password** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        Specifies the password of a user who has permission to access your SVM.

        

      
      - **User** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        Specifies a user that can mount and access the files, folders, and metadata in your SVM.

         

        For information about choosing a user with the right level of access for your transfer, see `Using the SMB protocol <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/create-ontap-location.html#create-ontap-location-smb>`__.

        

      
    
  
  :type SecurityGroupArns: list
  :param SecurityGroupArns: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies the Amazon EC2 security groups that provide access to your file system's preferred subnet.

     

    The security groups must allow outbound traffic on the following ports (depending on the protocol you use):

     

    
    * **Network File System (NFS)**: TCP ports 111, 635, and 2049
     
    * **Server Message Block (SMB)**: TCP port 445
    

     

    Your file system's security groups must also allow inbound traffic on the same ports.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type StorageVirtualMachineArn: string
  :param StorageVirtualMachineArn: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies the ARN of the storage virtual machine (SVM) in your file system where you want to copy data to or from.

    

  
  :type Subdirectory: string
  :param Subdirectory: 

    Specifies a path to the file share in the SVM where you want to transfer data to or from.

     

    You can specify a junction path (also known as a mount point), qtree path (for NFS file shares), or share name (for SMB file shares). For example, your mount path might be ``/vol1``, ``/vol1/tree1``, or ``/share1``.

     

    .. note::

      

      Don't specify a junction path in the SVM's root volume. For more information, see `Managing FSx for ONTAP storage virtual machines <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/managing-svms.html>`__ in the *Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP User Guide*.

      

    

  
  :type Tags: list
  :param Tags: 

    Specifies labels that help you categorize, filter, and search for your Amazon Web Services resources. We recommend creating at least a name tag for your location.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      A key-value pair representing a single tag that's been applied to an Amazon Web Services resource.

      

    
      - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The key for an Amazon Web Services resource tag.

        

      
      - **Value** *(string) --* 

        The value for an Amazon Web Services resource tag.
