.. py:method:: DataSync.Client.create_task(**kwargs)

  

  Configures a *task*, which defines where and how DataSync transfers your data.

   

  A task includes a source location, destination location, and transfer options (such as bandwidth limits, scheduling, and more).

   

  .. warning::

     

    If you're planning to transfer data to or from an Amazon S3 location, review `how DataSync can affect your S3 request charges <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/create-s3-location.html#create-s3-location-s3-requests>`__ and the `DataSync pricing page <http://aws.amazon.com/datasync/pricing/>`__ before you begin.

  :type SourceLocationArn: string
  :param SourceLocationArn: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies the ARN of your transfer's source location.

    

  
  :type DestinationLocationArn: string
  :param DestinationLocationArn: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies the ARN of your transfer's destination location.

    

  
  :type CloudWatchLogGroupArn: string
  :param CloudWatchLogGroupArn: 

    Specifies the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Amazon CloudWatch log group for monitoring your task.

     

    For Enhanced mode tasks, you don't need to specify anything. DataSync automatically sends logs to a CloudWatch log group named ``/aws/datasync``.

    

  
  :type Name: string
  :param Name: 

    Specifies the name of your task.

    

  
  :type Options: dict
  :param Options: 

    Specifies your task's settings, such as preserving file metadata, verifying data integrity, among other options.

    

  
    - **VerifyMode** *(string) --* 

      Specifies if and how DataSync checks the integrity of your data at the end of your transfer.

       

      
      * ``ONLY_FILES_TRANSFERRED`` (recommended) - DataSync calculates the checksum of transferred data (including metadata) at the source location. At the end of the transfer, DataSync then compares this checksum to the checksum calculated on that data at the destination. 

      .. note::

        This is the default option for `Enhanced mode tasks <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/choosing-task-mode.html>`__.

       We recommend this option when transferring to S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes. For more information, see `Storage class considerations with Amazon S3 locations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/create-s3-location.html#using-storage-classes>`__.
       
      * ``POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT`` - At the end of the transfer, DataSync checks the entire source and destination to verify that both locations are fully synchronized. 

      .. note::

        The is the default option for `Basic mode tasks <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/choosing-task-mode.html>`__ and isn't currently supported with Enhanced mode tasks.

       If you use a `manifest <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/transferring-with-manifest.html>`__, DataSync only scans and verifies what's listed in the manifest. You can't use this option when transferring to S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes. For more information, see `Storage class considerations with Amazon S3 locations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/create-s3-location.html#using-storage-classes>`__.
       
      * ``NONE`` - DataSync performs data integrity checks only during your transfer. Unlike other options, there's no additional verification at the end of your transfer.
      

      

    
    - **OverwriteMode** *(string) --* 

      Specifies whether DataSync should modify or preserve data at the destination location.

       

      
      * ``ALWAYS`` (default) - DataSync modifies data in the destination location when source data (including metadata) has changed. If DataSync overwrites objects, you might incur additional charges for certain Amazon S3 storage classes (for example, for retrieval or early deletion). For more information, see `Storage class considerations with Amazon S3 transfers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/create-s3-location.html#using-storage-classes>`__.
       
      * ``NEVER`` - DataSync doesn't overwrite data in the destination location even if the source data has changed. You can use this option to protect against overwriting changes made to files or objects in the destination.
      

      

    
    - **Atime** *(string) --* 

      Specifies whether to preserve metadata indicating the last time a file was read or written to.

       

      .. note::

        

        The behavior of ``Atime`` isn't fully standard across platforms, so DataSync can only do this on a best-effort basis.

        

       

      
      * ``BEST_EFFORT`` (default) - DataSync attempts to preserve the original ``Atime`` attribute on all source files (that is, the version before the ``PREPARING`` steps of the task execution). This option is recommended.
       
      * ``NONE`` - Ignores ``Atime``.
      

       

      .. note::

        

        If ``Atime`` is set to ``BEST_EFFORT``, ``Mtime`` must be set to ``PRESERVE``.

         

        If ``Atime`` is set to ``NONE``, ``Mtime`` must also be ``NONE``.

        

      

    
    - **Mtime** *(string) --* 

      Specifies whether to preserve metadata indicating the last time that a file was written to before the ``PREPARING`` step of your task execution. This option is required when you need to run the a task more than once.

       

      
      * ``PRESERVE`` (default) - Preserves original ``Mtime``, which is recommended.
       
      * ``NONE`` - Ignores ``Mtime``.
      

       

      .. note::

        

        If ``Mtime`` is set to ``PRESERVE``, ``Atime`` must be set to ``BEST_EFFORT``.

         

        If ``Mtime`` is set to ``NONE``, ``Atime`` must also be set to ``NONE``.

        

      

    
    - **Uid** *(string) --* 

      Specifies the POSIX user ID (UID) of the file's owner.

       

      
      * ``INT_VALUE`` (default) - Preserves the integer value of UID and group ID (GID), which is recommended.
       
      * ``NONE`` - Ignores UID and GID.
      

       

      For more information, see `Metadata copied by DataSync <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/special-files.html#metadata-copied>`__.

      

    
    - **Gid** *(string) --* 

      Specifies the POSIX group ID (GID) of the file's owners.

       

      
      * ``INT_VALUE`` (default) - Preserves the integer value of user ID (UID) and GID, which is recommended.
       
      * ``NONE`` - Ignores UID and GID.
      

       

      For more information, see `Understanding how DataSync handles file and object metadata <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/metadata-copied.html>`__.

      

    
    - **PreserveDeletedFiles** *(string) --* 

      Specifies whether files in the destination location that don't exist in the source should be preserved. This option can affect your Amazon S3 storage cost. If your task deletes objects, you might incur minimum storage duration charges for certain storage classes. For detailed information, see `Considerations when working with Amazon S3 storage classes in DataSync <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/create-s3-location.html#using-storage-classes>`__.

       

      
      * ``PRESERVE`` (default) - Ignores such destination files, which is recommended.
       
      * ``REMOVE`` - Deletes destination files that aren’t present in the source.
      

       

      .. note::

        

        If you set this parameter to ``REMOVE``, you can't set ``TransferMode`` to ``ALL``. When you transfer all data, DataSync doesn't scan your destination location and doesn't know what to delete.

        

      

    
    - **PreserveDevices** *(string) --* 

      Specifies whether DataSync should preserve the metadata of block and character devices in the source location and recreate the files with that device name and metadata on the destination. DataSync copies only the name and metadata of such devices.

       

      .. note::

        

        DataSync can't copy the actual contents of these devices because they're nonterminal and don't return an end-of-file (EOF) marker.

        

       

      
      * ``NONE`` (default) - Ignores special devices (recommended).
       
      * ``PRESERVE`` - Preserves character and block device metadata. This option currently isn't supported for Amazon EFS.
      

      

    
    - **PosixPermissions** *(string) --* 

      Specifies which users or groups can access a file for a specific purpose such as reading, writing, or execution of the file.

       

      For more information, see `Understanding how DataSync handles file and object metadata <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/metadata-copied.html>`__.

       

      
      * ``PRESERVE`` (default) - Preserves POSIX-style permissions, which is recommended.
       
      * ``NONE`` - Ignores POSIX-style permissions.
      

       

      .. note::

        

        DataSync can preserve extant permissions of a source location.

        

      

    
    - **BytesPerSecond** *(integer) --* 

      Limits the bandwidth used by a DataSync task. For example, if you want DataSync to use a maximum of 1 MB, set this value to ``1048576`` ( ``=1024*1024``).

      

    
    - **TaskQueueing** *(string) --* 

      Specifies whether your transfer tasks should be put into a queue during certain scenarios when `running multiple tasks <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/run-task.html#running-multiple-tasks>`__. This is ``ENABLED`` by default.

      

    
    - **LogLevel** *(string) --* 

      Specifies the type of logs that DataSync publishes to a Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group. To specify the log group, see `CloudWatchLogGroupArn <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/API_CreateTask.html#DataSync-CreateTask-request-CloudWatchLogGroupArn>`__.

       

      
      * ``BASIC`` - Publishes logs with only basic information (such as transfer errors).
       
      * ``TRANSFER`` - Publishes logs for all files or objects that your DataSync task transfers and performs data-integrity checks on.
       
      * ``OFF`` - No logs are published.
      

      

    
    - **TransferMode** *(string) --* 

      Specifies whether DataSync transfers only the data (including metadata) that differs between locations following an initial copy or transfers all data every time you run the task. If you're planning on recurring transfers, you might only want to transfer what's changed since your previous task execution.

       

      
      * ``CHANGED`` (default) - After your initial full transfer, DataSync copies only the data and metadata that differs between the source and destination location.
       
      * ``ALL`` - DataSync copies everything in the source to the destination without comparing differences between the locations.
      

      

    
    - **SecurityDescriptorCopyFlags** *(string) --* 

      Specifies which components of the SMB security descriptor are copied from source to destination objects.

       

      This value is only used for transfers between SMB and Amazon FSx for Windows File Server locations or between two FSx for Windows File Server locations. For more information, see `Understanding how DataSync handles file and object metadata <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/metadata-copied.html>`__.

       

      
      * ``OWNER_DACL`` (default) - For each copied object, DataSync copies the following metadata: 

        
        * The object owner.
         
        * NTFS discretionary access control lists (DACLs), which determine whether to grant access to an object. DataSync won't copy NTFS system access control lists (SACLs) with this option.
        

      
       
      * ``OWNER_DACL_SACL`` - For each copied object, DataSync copies the following metadata: 

        
        * The object owner.
         
        * NTFS discretionary access control lists (DACLs), which determine whether to grant access to an object.
         
        * SACLs, which are used by administrators to log attempts to access a secured object. Copying SACLs requires granting additional permissions to the Windows user that DataSync uses to access your SMB location. For information about choosing a user with the right permissions, see required permissions for `SMB <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/create-smb-location.html#configuring-smb-permissions>`__, `FSx for Windows File Server <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/create-fsx-location.html#create-fsx-windows-location-permissions>`__, or `FSx for ONTAP <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/create-ontap-location.html#create-ontap-location-smb>`__ (depending on the type of location in your transfer).
        

      
       
      * ``NONE`` - None of the SMB security descriptor components are copied. Destination objects are owned by the user that was provided for accessing the destination location. DACLs and SACLs are set based on the destination server’s configuration.
      

      

    
    - **ObjectTags** *(string) --* 

      Specifies whether you want DataSync to ``PRESERVE`` object tags (default behavior) when transferring between object storage systems. If you want your DataSync task to ignore object tags, specify the ``NONE`` value.

      

    
  
  :type Excludes: list
  :param Excludes: 

    Specifies exclude filters that define the files, objects, and folders in your source location that you don't want DataSync to transfer. For more information and examples, see `Specifying what DataSync transfers by using filters <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/filtering.html>`__.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      Specifies which files, folders, and objects to include or exclude when transferring files from source to destination.

      

    
      - **FilterType** *(string) --* 

        The type of filter rule to apply. DataSync only supports the SIMPLE_PATTERN rule type.

        

      
      - **Value** *(string) --* 

        A single filter string that consists of the patterns to include or exclude. The patterns are delimited by "|" (that is, a pipe), for example: ``/folder1|/folder2``

        

      
    

  :type Schedule: dict
  :param Schedule: 

    Specifies a schedule for when you want your task to run. For more information, see `Scheduling your task <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/task-scheduling.html>`__.

    

  
    - **ScheduleExpression** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      Specifies your task schedule by using a cron or rate expression.

       

      Use cron expressions for task schedules that run on a specific time and day. For example, the following cron expression creates a task schedule that runs at 8 AM on the first Wednesday of every month:

       

      ``cron(0 8 * * 3#1)``

       

      Use rate expressions for task schedules that run on a regular interval. For example, the following rate expression creates a task schedule that runs every 12 hours:

       

      ``rate(12 hours)``

       

      For information about cron and rate expression syntax, see the `Amazon EventBridge User Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-scheduled-rule-pattern.html>`__.

      

    
    - **Status** *(string) --* 

      Specifies whether to enable or disable your task schedule. Your schedule is enabled by default, but there can be situations where you need to disable it. For example, you might need to pause a recurring transfer to fix an issue with your task or perform maintenance on your storage system.

       

      DataSync might disable your schedule automatically if your task fails repeatedly with the same error. For more information, see `TaskScheduleDetails <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/API_TaskScheduleDetails.html>`__.

      

    
  
  :type Tags: list
  :param Tags: 

    Specifies the tags that you want to apply to your task.

     

    *Tags* are key-value pairs that help you manage, filter, and search for your DataSync resources.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      A key-value pair representing a single tag that's been applied to an Amazon Web Services resource.

      

    
      - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The key for an Amazon Web Services resource tag.

        

      
      - **Value** *(string) --* 

        The value for an Amazon Web Services resource tag.

        

      
    

  :type Includes: list
  :param Includes: 

    Specifies include filters that define the files, objects, and folders in your source location that you want DataSync to transfer. For more information and examples, see `Specifying what DataSync transfers by using filters <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/filtering.html>`__.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      Specifies which files, folders, and objects to include or exclude when transferring files from source to destination.

      

    
      - **FilterType** *(string) --* 

        The type of filter rule to apply. DataSync only supports the SIMPLE_PATTERN rule type.

        

      
      - **Value** *(string) --* 

        A single filter string that consists of the patterns to include or exclude. The patterns are delimited by "|" (that is, a pipe), for example: ``/folder1|/folder2``

        

      
    

  :type ManifestConfig: dict
  :param ManifestConfig: 

    Configures a manifest, which is a list of files or objects that you want DataSync to transfer. For more information and configuration examples, see `Specifying what DataSync transfers by using a manifest <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/transferring-with-manifest.html>`__.

     

    When using this parameter, your caller identity (the role that you're using DataSync with) must have the ``iam:PassRole`` permission. The `AWSDataSyncFullAccess <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/security-iam-awsmanpol.html#security-iam-awsmanpol-awsdatasyncfullaccess>`__ policy includes this permission.

    - **ObjectVersionIds** *(string) --* 

      Specifies whether your task report includes the new version of each object transferred into an S3 bucket. This only applies if you `enable versioning on your bucket <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/manage-versioning-examples.html>`__. Keep in mind that setting this to ``INCLUDE`` can increase the duration of your task execution.

      

    
    - **Overrides** *(dict) --* 

      Customizes the reporting level for aspects of your task report. For example, your report might generally only include errors, but you could specify that you want a list of successes and errors just for the files that DataSync attempted to delete in your destination location.

      

    
      - **Transferred** *(dict) --* 

        Specifies the level of reporting for the files, objects, and directories that DataSync attempted to transfer.

          For example, your report might mostly include only what didn't go well in your transfer ( ``ERRORS_ONLY``). At the same time, you want to verify that your `task filter <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/filtering.html>`__ is working correctly. In this situation, you can get a list of what files DataSync successfully skipped and if something transferred that you didn't to transfer ( ``SUCCESSES_AND_ERRORS``).

          

        
      
      - **Verified** *(dict) --* 

        Specifies the level of reporting for the files, objects, and directories that DataSync attempted to verify at the end of your transfer.

  :type TaskMode: string
  :param TaskMode: 

    Specifies one of the following task modes for your data transfer:

     

    
    * ``ENHANCED`` - Transfer virtually unlimited numbers of objects with higher performance than Basic mode. Enhanced mode tasks optimize the data transfer process by listing, preparing, transferring, and verifying data in parallel. Enhanced mode is currently available for transfers between Amazon S3 locations, transfers between Azure Blob and Amazon S3 without an agent, and transfers between other clouds and Amazon S3 without an agent. 

    .. note::

      To create an Enhanced mode task, the IAM role that you use to call the ``CreateTask`` operation must have the ``iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole`` permission.

    
     
    * ``BASIC`` (default) - Transfer files or objects between Amazon Web Services storage and all other supported DataSync locations. Basic mode tasks are subject to `quotas <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/datasync-limits.html>`__ on the number of files, objects, and directories in a dataset. Basic mode sequentially prepares, transfers, and verifies data, making it slower than Enhanced mode for most workloads.
