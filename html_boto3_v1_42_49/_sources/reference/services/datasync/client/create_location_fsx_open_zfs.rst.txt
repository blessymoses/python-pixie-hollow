.. py:method:: DataSync.Client.create_location_fsx_open_zfs(**kwargs)

  

  Creates a transfer *location* for an Amazon FSx for OpenZFS file system. DataSync can use this location as a source or destination for transferring data.

   

  Before you begin, make sure that you understand how DataSync `accesses FSx for OpenZFS file systems <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/create-openzfs-location.html#create-openzfs-access>`__.

   

  .. note::

    

    Request parameters related to ``SMB`` aren't supported with the ``CreateLocationFsxOpenZfs`` operation.

    )
    
  :type FsxFilesystemArn: string
  :param FsxFilesystemArn: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the FSx for OpenZFS file system.

    

  
  :type Protocol: dict
  :param Protocol: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The type of protocol that DataSync uses to access your file system.

    

  
    - **NFS** *(dict) --* 

      Specifies the Network File System (NFS) protocol configuration that DataSync uses to access your FSx for OpenZFS file system or FSx for ONTAP file system's storage virtual machine (SVM).

      

    
      - **MountOptions** *(dict) --* 

        Specifies how DataSync can access a location using the NFS protocol.

        

      
        - **Version** *(string) --* 

          Specifies the NFS version that you want DataSync to use when mounting your NFS share. If the server refuses to use the version specified, the task fails.

           

          You can specify the following options:

           

          
          * ``AUTOMATIC`` (default): DataSync chooses NFS version 4.1.
           
          * ``NFS3``: Stateless protocol version that allows for asynchronous writes on the server.
           
          * ``NFSv4_0``: Stateful, firewall-friendly protocol version that supports delegations and pseudo file systems.
           
          * ``NFSv4_1``: Stateful protocol version that supports sessions, directory delegations, and parallel data processing. NFS version 4.1 also includes all features available in version 4.0.
          

           

          .. note::

            

            DataSync currently only supports NFS version 3 with Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP locations.

            

          

        
      
    
    - **SMB** *(dict) --* 

      Specifies the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol configuration that DataSync uses to access your FSx for ONTAP file system's SVM.

      

    
      - **Domain** *(string) --* 

        Specifies the name of the Windows domain that your storage virtual machine (SVM) belongs to.

         

        If you have multiple domains in your environment, configuring this setting makes sure that DataSync connects to the right SVM.

         

        If you have multiple Active Directory domains in your environment, configuring this parameter makes sure that DataSync connects to the right SVM.

        

      
      - **MountOptions** *(dict) --* 

        Specifies the version of the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol that DataSync uses to access an SMB file server.

        

      
        - **Version** *(string) --* 

          By default, DataSync automatically chooses an SMB protocol version based on negotiation with your SMB file server. You also can configure DataSync to use a specific SMB version, but we recommend doing this only if DataSync has trouble negotiating with the SMB file server automatically.

           

          These are the following options for configuring the SMB version:

           

          
          * ``AUTOMATIC`` (default): DataSync and the SMB file server negotiate the highest version of SMB that they mutually support between 2.1 and 3.1.1. This is the recommended option. If you instead choose a specific version that your file server doesn't support, you may get an ``Operation Not Supported`` error.
           
          * ``SMB3``: Restricts the protocol negotiation to only SMB version 3.0.2.
           
          * ``SMB2``: Restricts the protocol negotiation to only SMB version 2.1.
           
          * ``SMB2_0``: Restricts the protocol negotiation to only SMB version 2.0.
           
          * ``SMB1``: Restricts the protocol negotiation to only SMB version 1.0. 

          .. note::

            The ``SMB1`` option isn't available when `creating an Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP location <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/API_CreateLocationFsxOntap.html>`__.

          
          

          

        
      
      - **Password** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        Specifies the password of a user who has permission to access your SVM.

        

      
      - **User** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        Specifies a user that can mount and access the files, folders, and metadata in your SVM.

         

        For information about choosing a user with the right level of access for your transfer, see `Using the SMB protocol <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/create-ontap-location.html#create-ontap-location-smb>`__.

        

      
    
  
  :type SecurityGroupArns: list
  :param SecurityGroupArns: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ARNs of the security groups that are used to configure the FSx for OpenZFS file system.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type Subdirectory: string
  :param Subdirectory: 

    A subdirectory in the location's path that must begin with ``/fsx``. DataSync uses this subdirectory to read or write data (depending on whether the file system is a source or destination location).

    

  
  :type Tags: list
  :param Tags: 

    The key-value pair that represents a tag that you want to add to the resource. The value can be an empty string. This value helps you manage, filter, and search for your resources. We recommend that you create a name tag for your location.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      A key-value pair representing a single tag that's been applied to an Amazon Web Services resource.

      

    
      - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The key for an Amazon Web Services resource tag.

        

      
      - **Value** *(string) --* 

        The value for an Amazon Web Services resource tag.
