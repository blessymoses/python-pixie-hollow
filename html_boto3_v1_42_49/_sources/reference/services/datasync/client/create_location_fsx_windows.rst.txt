.. py:method:: DataSync.Client.create_location_fsx_windows(**kwargs)

  

  Creates a transfer *location* for an Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file system. DataSync can use this location as a source or destination for transferring data.

   

  Before you begin, make sure that you understand how DataSync `accesses FSx for Windows File Server file systems <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/create-fsx-location.html#create-fsx-location-access>`__.

    )
    
  :type Subdirectory: string
  :param Subdirectory: 

    Specifies a mount path for your file system using forward slashes. This is where DataSync reads or writes data (depending on if this is a source or destination location).

    

  
  :type FsxFilesystemArn: string
  :param FsxFilesystemArn: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the FSx for Windows File Server file system.

    

  
  :type SecurityGroupArns: list
  :param SecurityGroupArns: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies the ARNs of the Amazon EC2 security groups that provide access to your file system's preferred subnet.

     

    The security groups that you specify must be able to communicate with your file system's security groups. For information about configuring security groups for file system access, see the `Amazon FSx for Windows File Server User Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/limit-access-security-groups.html>`__.

     

    .. note::

      

      If you choose a security group that doesn't allow connections from within itself, do one of the following:

       

      
      * Configure the security group to allow it to communicate within itself.
       
      * Choose a different security group that can communicate with the mount target's security group.

    Specifies the user with the permissions to mount and access the files, folders, and file metadata in your FSx for Windows File Server file system.

     

    For information about choosing a user with the right level of access for your transfer, see `required permissions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/create-fsx-location.html#create-fsx-windows-location-permissions>`__ for FSx for Windows File Server locations.

    

  
  :type Domain: string
  :param Domain: 

    Specifies the name of the Windows domain that the FSx for Windows File Server file system belongs to.

     

    If you have multiple Active Directory domains in your environment, configuring this parameter makes sure that DataSync connects to the right file system.

    

  
  :type Password: string
  :param Password: **[REQUIRED]**
