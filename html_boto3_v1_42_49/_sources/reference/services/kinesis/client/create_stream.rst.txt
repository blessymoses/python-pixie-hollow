.. py:method:: Kinesis.Client.create_stream(**kwargs)

  

  Creates a Kinesis data stream. A stream captures and transports data records that are continuously emitted from different data sources or *producers*. Scale-out within a stream is explicitly supported by means of shards, which are uniquely identified groups of data records in a stream.

   

  You can create your data stream using either on-demand or provisioned capacity mode. Data streams with an on-demand mode require no capacity planning and automatically scale to handle gigabytes of write and read throughput per minute. With the on-demand mode, Kinesis Data Streams automatically manages the shards in order to provide the necessary throughput.

   

  If you'd still like to proactively scale your on-demand data stream’s capacity, you can unlock the warm throughput feature for on-demand data streams by enabling ``MinimumThroughputBillingCommitment`` for your account. Once your account has ``MinimumThroughputBillingCommitment`` enabled, you can specify the warm throughput in MiB per second that your stream can support in writes.

   

  For the data streams with a provisioned mode, you must specify the number of shards for the data stream. Each shard can support reads up to five transactions per second, up to a maximum data read total of 2 MiB per second. Each shard can support writes up to 1,000 records per second, up to a maximum data write total of 1 MiB per second. If the amount of data input increases or decreases, you can add or remove shards.

   

  The stream name identifies the stream. The name is scoped to the Amazon Web Services account used by the application. It is also scoped by Amazon Web Services Region. That is, two streams in two different accounts can have the same name, and two streams in the same account, but in two different Regions, can have the same name.

   

  ``CreateStream`` is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving a ``CreateStream`` request, Kinesis Data Streams immediately returns and sets the stream status to ``CREATING``. After the stream is created, Kinesis Data Streams sets the stream status to ``ACTIVE``. You should perform read and write operations only on an ``ACTIVE`` stream.

   

  You receive a ``LimitExceededException`` when making a ``CreateStream`` request when you try to do one of the following:

   

  
  * Have more than five streams in the ``CREATING`` state at any point in time.
   
  * Create more shards than are authorized for your account.
  

   

  For the default shard or on-demand throughput limits for an Amazon Web Services account, see `Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Limits <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/service-sizes-and-limits.html>`__ in the *Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide*. To increase this limit, `contact Amazon Web Services Support <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html>`__.

   

  You can use  DescribeStreamSummary to check the stream status, which is returned in ``StreamStatus``.

   

   CreateStream has a limit of five transactions per second per account.

   

  You can add tags to the stream when making a ``CreateStream`` request by setting the ``Tags`` parameter. If you pass the ``Tags`` parameter, in addition to having the ``kinesis:CreateStream`` permission, you must also have the ``kinesis:AddTagsToStream`` permission for the stream that will be created. The ``kinesis:TagResource`` permission won’t work to tag streams on creation. Tags will take effect from the ``CREATING`` status of the stream, but you can't make any updates to the tags until the stream is in ``ACTIVE`` state.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.create_stream(
        StreamName='string',
        ShardCount=123,
        StreamModeDetails={
            'StreamMode': 'PROVISIONED'|'ON_DEMAND'
        },
        Tags={
            'string': 'string'
        },
        WarmThroughputMiBps=123,
        MaxRecordSizeInKiB=123
    )
    
  :type StreamName: string
  :param StreamName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A name to identify the stream. The stream name is scoped to the Amazon Web Services account used by the application that creates the stream. It is also scoped by Amazon Web Services Region. That is, two streams in two different Amazon Web Services accounts can have the same name. Two streams in the same Amazon Web Services account but in two different Regions can also have the same name.

    

  
  :type ShardCount: integer
  :param ShardCount: 

    The number of shards that the stream will use. The throughput of the stream is a function of the number of shards; more shards are required for greater provisioned throughput.

    

  
  :type StreamModeDetails: dict
  :param StreamModeDetails: 

    Indicates the capacity mode of the data stream. Currently, in Kinesis Data Streams, you can choose between an **on-demand** capacity mode and a **provisioned** capacity mode for your data streams.

    

  
    - **StreamMode** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      Specifies the capacity mode to which you want to set your data stream. Currently, in Kinesis Data Streams, you can choose between an **on-demand** capacity mode and a **provisioned** capacity mode for your data streams.

      

    
  
  :type Tags: dict
  :param Tags: 

    A set of up to 50 key-value pairs to use to create the tags. A tag consists of a required key and an optional value.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    
      - *(string) --* 

      


  :type WarmThroughputMiBps: integer
  :param WarmThroughputMiBps: 

    The target warm throughput in MB/s that the stream should be scaled to handle. This represents the throughput capacity that will be immediately available for write operations.

    

  
  :type MaxRecordSizeInKiB: integer
  :param MaxRecordSizeInKiB: 

    The maximum record size of a single record in kibibyte (KiB) that you can write to, and read from a stream.
