.. py:method:: Kinesis.Client.register_stream_consumer(**kwargs)

  

  Registers a consumer with a Kinesis data stream. When you use this operation, the consumer you register can then call  SubscribeToShard to receive data from the stream using enhanced fan-out, at a rate of up to 2 MiB per second for every shard you subscribe to. This rate is unaffected by the total number of consumers that read from the same stream.

   

  You can add tags to the registered consumer when making a ``RegisterStreamConsumer`` request by setting the ``Tags`` parameter. If you pass the ``Tags`` parameter, in addition to having the ``kinesis:RegisterStreamConsumer`` permission, you must also have the ``kinesis:TagResource`` permission for the consumer that will be registered. Tags will take effect from the ``CREATING`` status of the consumer.

   

  With On-demand Advantage streams, you can register up to 50 consumers per stream to use Enhanced Fan-out. With On-demand Standard and Provisioned streams, you can register up to 20 consumers per stream to use Enhanced Fan-out. A given consumer can only be registered with one stream at a time.

   

  For an example of how to use this operation, see `Enhanced Fan-Out Using the Kinesis Data Streams API <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/building-enhanced-consumers-api.html>`__.

   

  The use of this operation has a limit of five transactions per second per account. Also, only 5 consumers can be created simultaneously. In other words, you cannot have more than 5 consumers in a ``CREATING`` status at the same time. Registering a 6th consumer while there are 5 in a ``CREATING`` status results in a ``LimitExceededException``.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.register_stream_consumer(
        StreamARN='string',
        ConsumerName='string',
        StreamId='string',
        Tags={
            'string': 'string'
        }
    )
    
  :type StreamARN: string
  :param StreamARN: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ARN of the Kinesis data stream that you want to register the consumer with. For more info, see `Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and Amazon Web Services Service Namespaces <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html#arn-syntax-kinesis-streams>`__.

    

  
  :type ConsumerName: string
  :param ConsumerName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    For a given Kinesis data stream, each consumer must have a unique name. However, consumer names don't have to be unique across data streams.

    

  
  :type StreamId: string
  :param StreamId: 

    Not Implemented. Reserved for future use.

    

  
  :type Tags: dict
  :param Tags: 

    A set of up to 50 key-value pairs. A tag consists of a required key and an optional value.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **Consumer** *(dict) --* 

        An object that represents the details of the consumer you registered. When you register a consumer, it gets an ARN that is generated by Kinesis Data Streams.

        
        

        - **ConsumerName** *(string) --* 

          The name of the consumer is something you choose when you register the consumer.

          
        

        - **ConsumerARN** *(string) --* 

          When you register a consumer, Kinesis Data Streams generates an ARN for it. You need this ARN to be able to call  SubscribeToShard.

           

          If you delete a consumer and then create a new one with the same name, it won't have the same ARN. That's because consumer ARNs contain the creation timestamp. This is important to keep in mind if you have IAM policies that reference consumer ARNs.

          
        

        - **ConsumerStatus** *(string) --* 

          A consumer can't read data while in the ``CREATING`` or ``DELETING`` states.

          
        

        - **ConsumerCreationTimestamp** *(datetime) --*
