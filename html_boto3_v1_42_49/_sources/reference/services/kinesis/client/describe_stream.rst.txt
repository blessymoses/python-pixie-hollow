.. py:method:: Kinesis.Client.describe_stream(**kwargs)

  

  Describes the specified Kinesis data stream.

   

  .. note::

    

    This API has been revised. It's highly recommended that you use the  DescribeStreamSummary API to get a summarized description of the specified Kinesis data stream and the  ListShards API to list the shards in a specified data stream and obtain information about each shard.

    

   

  .. note::

    

    When invoking this API, you must use either the ``StreamARN`` or the ``StreamName`` parameter, or both. It is recommended that you use the ``StreamARN`` input parameter when you invoke this API.

    

   

  The information returned includes the stream name, Amazon Resource Name (ARN), creation time, enhanced metric configuration, and shard map. The shard map is an array of shard objects. For each shard object, there is the hash key and sequence number ranges that the shard spans, and the IDs of any earlier shards that played in a role in creating the shard. Every record ingested in the stream is identified by a sequence number, which is assigned when the record is put into the stream.

   

  You can limit the number of shards returned by each call. For more information, see `Retrieving Shards from a Stream <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/kinesis-using-sdk-java-retrieve-shards.html>`__ in the *Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide*.

   

  There are no guarantees about the chronological order shards returned. To process shards in chronological order, use the ID of the parent shard to track the lineage to the oldest shard.

   

  This operation has a limit of 10 transactions per second per account.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.describe_stream(
        StreamName='string',
        Limit=123,
        ExclusiveStartShardId='string',
        StreamARN='string',
        StreamId='string'
    )
    
  :type StreamName: string
  :param StreamName: 

    The name of the stream to describe.

    

  
  :type Limit: integer
  :param Limit: 

    The maximum number of shards to return in a single call. The default value is 100. If you specify a value greater than 100, at most 100 results are returned.

    

  
  :type ExclusiveStartShardId: string
  :param ExclusiveStartShardId: 

    The shard ID of the shard to start with.

     

    Specify this parameter to indicate that you want to describe the stream starting with the shard whose ID immediately follows ``ExclusiveStartShardId``.

     

    If you don't specify this parameter, the default behavior for ``DescribeStream`` is to describe the stream starting with the first shard in the stream.

    

  
  :type StreamARN: string
  :param StreamARN: 

    The ARN of the stream.

    

  
  :type StreamId: string
  :param StreamId: 

    Not Implemented. Reserved for future use.

      - **StreamDescription** *(dict) --* 

        The current status of the stream, the stream Amazon Resource Name (ARN), an array of shard objects that comprise the stream, and whether there are more shards available.

        
        

        - **StreamName** *(string) --* 

          The name of the stream being described.

          
        

        - **StreamARN** *(string) --*

          * ``ACTIVE`` - The stream exists and is ready for read and write operations or deletion. You should perform read and write operations only on an ``ACTIVE`` stream.
           
          * ``UPDATING`` - Shards in the stream are being merged or split. Read and write operations continue to work while the stream is in the ``UPDATING`` state.
