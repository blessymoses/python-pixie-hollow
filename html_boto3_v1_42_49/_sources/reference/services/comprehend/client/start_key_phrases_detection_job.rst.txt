    )
    
  :type InputDataConfig: dict
  :param InputDataConfig: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies the format and location of the input data for the job.

    

  
    - **S3Uri** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The Amazon S3 URI for the input data. The URI must be in same Region as the API endpoint that you are calling. The URI can point to a single input file or it can provide the prefix for a collection of data files.

       

      For example, if you use the URI ``S3://bucketName/prefix``, if the prefix is a single file, Amazon Comprehend uses that file as input. If more than one file begins with the prefix, Amazon Comprehend uses all of them as input.

      

    
    - **InputFormat** *(string) --* 

      Specifies how the text in an input file should be processed:

       

      
      * ``ONE_DOC_PER_FILE`` - Each file is considered a separate document. Use this option when you are processing large documents, such as newspaper articles or scientific papers.
       
      * ``ONE_DOC_PER_LINE`` - Each line in a file is considered a separate document. Use this option when you are processing many short documents, such as text messages.
      

      

    
    - **DocumentReaderConfig** *(dict) --* 

      Provides configuration parameters to override the default actions for extracting text from PDF documents and image files.

      

    
      - **DocumentReadAction** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        This field defines the Amazon Textract API operation that Amazon Comprehend uses to extract text from PDF files and image files. Enter one of the following values:

         

        
        * ``TEXTRACT_DETECT_DOCUMENT_TEXT`` - The Amazon Comprehend service uses the ``DetectDocumentText`` API operation.
         
        * ``TEXTRACT_ANALYZE_DOCUMENT`` - The Amazon Comprehend service uses the ``AnalyzeDocument`` API operation.
        

        

      
      - **DocumentReadMode** *(string) --* 

        Determines the text extraction actions for PDF files. Enter one of the following values:

         

        
        * ``SERVICE_DEFAULT`` - use the Amazon Comprehend service defaults for PDF files.
         
        * ``FORCE_DOCUMENT_READ_ACTION`` - Amazon Comprehend uses the Textract API specified by DocumentReadAction for all PDF files, including digital PDF files.
        

        

      
      - **FeatureTypes** *(list) --* 

        Specifies the type of Amazon Textract features to apply. If you chose ``TEXTRACT_ANALYZE_DOCUMENT`` as the read action, you must specify one or both of the following values:

         

        
        * ``TABLES`` - Returns additional information about any tables that are detected in the input document.
         
        * ``FORMS`` - Returns additional information about any forms that are detected in the input document.
        

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

          TABLES or FORMS

          

        
    
    
  
  :type OutputDataConfig: dict
  :param OutputDataConfig: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies where to send the output files.

    

  
    - **S3Uri** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      When you use the ``OutputDataConfig`` object with asynchronous operations, you specify the Amazon S3 location where you want to write the output data. The URI must be in the same Region as the API endpoint that you are calling. The location is used as the prefix for the actual location of the output file.

       

      When the topic detection job is finished, the service creates an output file in a directory specific to the job. The ``S3Uri`` field contains the location of the output file, called ``output.tar.gz``. It is a compressed archive that contains the ouput of the operation.

       

      For a PII entity detection job, the output file is plain text, not a compressed archive. The output file name is the same as the input file, with ``.out`` appended at the end.

      

    
    - **KmsKeyId** *(string) --* 

      ID for the Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (KMS) key that Amazon Comprehend uses to encrypt the output results from an analysis job. Specify the Key Id of a symmetric key, because you cannot use an asymmetric key for uploading data to S3.

       

      The KmsKeyId can be one of the following formats:

       

      
      * KMS Key ID: ``"1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"``
       
      * Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a KMS Key: ``"arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"``
       
      * KMS Key Alias: ``"alias/ExampleAlias"``
       
      * ARN of a KMS Key Alias: ``"arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias"``
      

      

    
  
  :type DataAccessRoleArn: string
  :param DataAccessRoleArn: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that grants Amazon Comprehend read access to your input data. For more information, see `Role-based permissions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/comprehend/latest/dg/security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.html#auth-role-permissions>`__.

    

  
  :type JobName: string
  :param JobName: 

    The identifier of the job.

    

  
  :type LanguageCode: string
  :param LanguageCode: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The language of the input documents. You can specify any of the primary languages supported by Amazon Comprehend. All documents must be in the same language.

    

  
  :type ClientRequestToken: string
  :param ClientRequestToken: 

    A unique identifier for the request. If you don't set the client request token, Amazon Comprehend generates one.

    This field is autopopulated if not provided.

  
  :type VolumeKmsKeyId: string
  :param VolumeKmsKeyId: 

    ID for the Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (KMS) key that Amazon Comprehend uses to encrypt data on the storage volume attached to the ML compute instance(s) that process the analysis job. The VolumeKmsKeyId can be either of the following formats:

     

    
    * KMS Key ID: ``"1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"``
     
    * Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a KMS Key: ``"arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"``

    - **SecurityGroupIds** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The ID number for a security group on an instance of your private VPC.

      - *(string) --* 

      
  
  
  :type Tags: list
  :param Tags: 

    Tags to associate with the key phrases detection job. A tag is a key-value pair that adds metadata to a resource used by Amazon Comprehend. For example, a tag with "Sales" as the key might be added to a resource to indicate its use by the sales department.

    

  
    - *(dict) --*
