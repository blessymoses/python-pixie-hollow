  :type Tags: list
  :param Tags: 

    Tags to associate with the entity recognizer. A tag is a key-value pair that adds as a metadata to a resource used by Amazon Comprehend. For example, a tag with "Sales" as the key might be added to a resource to indicate its use by the sales department.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      A key-value pair that adds as a metadata to a resource used by Amazon Comprehend. For example, a tag with the key-value pair ‘Department’:’Sales’ might be added to a resource to indicate its use by a particular department.

      

    
      - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The initial part of a key-value pair that forms a tag associated with a given resource. For instance, if you want to show which resources are used by which departments, you might use “Department” as the key portion of the pair, with multiple possible values such as “sales,” “legal,” and “administration.”

        

      
      - **Value** *(string) --* 

        The second part of a key-value pair that forms a tag associated with a given resource. For instance, if you want to show which resources are used by which departments, you might use “Department” as the initial (key) portion of the pair, with a value of “sales” to indicate the sales department.

    - **DataFormat** *(string) --* 

      The format of your training data:

       

      
      * ``COMPREHEND_CSV``: A CSV file that supplements your training documents. The CSV file contains information about the custom entities that your trained model will detect. The required format of the file depends on whether you are providing annotations or an entity list. If you use this value, you must provide your CSV file by using either the ``Annotations`` or ``EntityList`` parameters. You must provide your training documents by using the ``Documents`` parameter.
       
      * ``AUGMENTED_MANIFEST``: A labeled dataset that is produced by Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth. This file is in JSON lines format. Each line is a complete JSON object that contains a training document and its labels. Each label annotates a named entity in the training document. If you use this value, you must provide the ``AugmentedManifests`` parameter in your request.

      - *(dict) --* 

        An augmented manifest file that provides training data for your custom model. An augmented manifest file is a labeled dataset that is produced by Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth.

  :type ModelPolicy: string
  :param ModelPolicy: 

    The JSON resource-based policy to attach to your custom entity recognizer model. You can use this policy to allow another Amazon Web Services account to import your custom model.

     

    Provide your JSON as a UTF-8 encoded string without line breaks. To provide valid JSON for your policy, enclose the attribute names and values in double quotes. If the JSON body is also enclosed in double quotes, then you must escape the double quotes that are inside the policy:
