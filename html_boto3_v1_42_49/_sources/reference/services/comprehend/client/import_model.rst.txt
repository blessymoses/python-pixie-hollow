.. py:method:: Comprehend.Client.import_model(**kwargs)

  

  Creates a new custom model that replicates a source custom model that you import. The source model can be in your Amazon Web Services account or another one.

   

  If the source model is in another Amazon Web Services account, then it must have a resource-based policy that authorizes you to import it.

   

  The source model must be in the same Amazon Web Services Region that you're using when you import. You can't import a model that's in a different Region.

  ::

    response = client.import_model(
        SourceModelArn='string',
        ModelName='string',
        VersionName='string',
        ModelKmsKeyId='string',
        DataAccessRoleArn='string',
        Tags=[
            {
                'Key': 'string',
                'Value': 'string'
            },
        ]
    )
    
  :type SourceModelArn: string
  :param SourceModelArn: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the custom model to import.

    

  
  :type ModelName: string
  :param ModelName: 

    The name to assign to the custom model that is created in Amazon Comprehend by this import.

    

  
  :type VersionName: string
  :param VersionName: 

    The version name given to the custom model that is created by this import. Version names can have a maximum of 256 characters. Alphanumeric characters, hyphens (-) and underscores (_) are allowed. The version name must be unique among all models with the same classifier name in the account/Region.

    

  
  :type ModelKmsKeyId: string
  :param ModelKmsKeyId: 

    ID for the KMS key that Amazon Comprehend uses to encrypt trained custom models. The ModelKmsKeyId can be either of the following formats:

     

    
    * KMS Key ID: ``"1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"``
     
    * Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a KMS Key: ``"arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"``
    

    

  
  :type DataAccessRoleArn: string
  :param DataAccessRoleArn: 

    The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that grants Amazon Comprehend permission to use Amazon Key Management Service (KMS) to encrypt or decrypt the custom model.

    

  
  :type Tags: list
  :param Tags: 

    Tags to associate with the custom model that is created by this import. A tag is a key-value pair that adds as a metadata to a resource used by Amazon Comprehend. For example, a tag with "Sales" as the key might be added to a resource to indicate its use by the sales department.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      A key-value pair that adds as a metadata to a resource used by Amazon Comprehend. For example, a tag with the key-value pair ‘Department’:’Sales’ might be added to a resource to indicate its use by a particular department.

      

    
      - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The initial part of a key-value pair that forms a tag associated with a given resource. For instance, if you want to show which resources are used by which departments, you might use “Department” as the key portion of the pair, with multiple possible values such as “sales,” “legal,” and “administration.”

        

      
      - **Value** *(string) --* 

        The second part of a key-value pair that forms a tag associated with a given resource.
