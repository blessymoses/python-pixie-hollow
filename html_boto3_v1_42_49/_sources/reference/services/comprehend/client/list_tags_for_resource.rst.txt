    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **ResourceArn** *(string) --* 

        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the given Amazon Comprehend resource you are querying.

        
      

      - **Tags** *(list) --* 

        Tags associated with the Amazon Comprehend resource being queried. A tag is a key-value pair that adds as a metadata to a resource used by Amazon Comprehend.

          - **Key** *(string) --* 

            The initial part of a key-value pair that forms a tag associated with a given resource. For instance, if you want to show which resources are used by which departments, you might use “Department” as the key portion of the pair, with multiple possible values such as “sales,” “legal,” and “administration.”

            
          

          - **Value** *(string) --* 

            The second part of a key-value pair that forms a tag associated with a given resource. For instance, if you want to show which resources are used by which departments, you might use “Department” as the initial (key) portion of the pair, with a value of “sales” to indicate the sales department.
