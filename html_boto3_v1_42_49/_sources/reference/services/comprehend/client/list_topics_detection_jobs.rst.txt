    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **TopicsDetectionJobPropertiesList** *(list) --* 

        A list containing the properties of each job that is returned.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          Provides information about a topic detection job.

          
          

          - **JobId** *(string) --* 

            The identifier assigned to the topic detection job.

            
          

          - **JobArn** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the topics detection job. It is a unique, fully qualified identifier for the job. It includes the Amazon Web Services account, Amazon Web Services Region, and the job ID. The format of the ARN is as follows:

             

            ``arn:<partition>:comprehend:<region>:<account-id>:topics-detection-job/<job-id>``

             

            The following is an example job ARN:

             

            ``arn:aws:comprehend:us-west-2:111122223333:topics-detection-job/1234abcd12ab34cd56ef1234567890ab``

            
          

          - **JobName** *(string) --* 

            The name of the topic detection job.

            
          

          - **JobStatus** *(string) --* 

            The current status of the topic detection job. If the status is ``Failed``, the reason for the failure is shown in the ``Message`` field.

            
          

          - **Message** *(string) --* 

            A description for the status of a job.

            
          

          - **SubmitTime** *(datetime) --* 

            The time that the topic detection job was submitted for processing.

            
          

          - **EndTime** *(datetime) --* 

            The time that the topic detection job was completed.

            
          

          - **InputDataConfig** *(dict) --* 

            The input data configuration supplied when you created the topic detection job.

            
            

            - **S3Uri** *(string) --* 

              The Amazon S3 URI for the input data. The URI must be in same Region as the API endpoint that you are calling. The URI can point to a single input file or it can provide the prefix for a collection of data files.

               

              For example, if you use the URI ``S3://bucketName/prefix``, if the prefix is a single file, Amazon Comprehend uses that file as input. If more than one file begins with the prefix, Amazon Comprehend uses all of them as input.

              
            

            - **InputFormat** *(string) --* 

              Specifies how the text in an input file should be processed:

               

              
              * ``ONE_DOC_PER_FILE`` - Each file is considered a separate document. Use this option when you are processing large documents, such as newspaper articles or scientific papers.
               
              * ``ONE_DOC_PER_LINE`` - Each line in a file is considered a separate document. Use this option when you are processing many short documents, such as text messages.
              

              
            

            - **DocumentReaderConfig** *(dict) --* 

              Provides configuration parameters to override the default actions for extracting text from PDF documents and image files.

              
              

              - **DocumentReadAction** *(string) --* 

                This field defines the Amazon Textract API operation that Amazon Comprehend uses to extract text from PDF files and image files. Enter one of the following values:

                 

                
                * ``TEXTRACT_DETECT_DOCUMENT_TEXT`` - The Amazon Comprehend service uses the ``DetectDocumentText`` API operation.
                 
                * ``TEXTRACT_ANALYZE_DOCUMENT`` - The Amazon Comprehend service uses the ``AnalyzeDocument`` API operation.
                

                
              

              - **DocumentReadMode** *(string) --* 

                Determines the text extraction actions for PDF files. Enter one of the following values:

                 

                
                * ``SERVICE_DEFAULT`` - use the Amazon Comprehend service defaults for PDF files.
                 
                * ``FORCE_DOCUMENT_READ_ACTION`` - Amazon Comprehend uses the Textract API specified by DocumentReadAction for all PDF files, including digital PDF files.
                

                
              

              - **FeatureTypes** *(list) --* 

                Specifies the type of Amazon Textract features to apply. If you chose ``TEXTRACT_ANALYZE_DOCUMENT`` as the read action, you must specify one or both of the following values:

                 

                
                * ``TABLES`` - Returns additional information about any tables that are detected in the input document.
                 
                * ``FORMS`` - Returns additional information about any forms that are detected in the input document.
                

                
                

                - *(string) --* 

                  TABLES or FORMS

                  
            
          
        
          

          - **OutputDataConfig** *(dict) --* 

            The output data configuration supplied when you created the topic detection job.

            
            

            - **S3Uri** *(string) --* 

              When you use the ``OutputDataConfig`` object with asynchronous operations, you specify the Amazon S3 location where you want to write the output data. The URI must be in the same Region as the API endpoint that you are calling. The location is used as the prefix for the actual location of the output file.

               

              When the topic detection job is finished, the service creates an output file in a directory specific to the job. The ``S3Uri`` field contains the location of the output file, called ``output.tar.gz``. It is a compressed archive that contains the ouput of the operation.

               

              For a PII entity detection job, the output file is plain text, not a compressed archive. The output file name is the same as the input file, with ``.out`` appended at the end.

              
            

            - **KmsKeyId** *(string) --* 

              ID for the Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (KMS) key that Amazon Comprehend uses to encrypt the output results from an analysis job. Specify the Key Id of a symmetric key, because you cannot use an asymmetric key for uploading data to S3.

               

              The KmsKeyId can be one of the following formats:

               

              
              * KMS Key ID: ``"1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"``
               
              * Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a KMS Key: ``"arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"``
               
              * KMS Key Alias: ``"alias/ExampleAlias"``
               
              * ARN of a KMS Key Alias: ``"arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias"``
              

              
        
          

          - **NumberOfTopics** *(integer) --* 

            The number of topics to detect supplied when you created the topic detection job. The default is 10.

            
          

          - **DataAccessRoleArn** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that grants Amazon Comprehend read access to your job data.

            
          

          - **VolumeKmsKeyId** *(string) --* 

            ID for the Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (KMS) key that Amazon Comprehend uses to encrypt data on the storage volume attached to the ML compute instance(s) that process the analysis job. The VolumeKmsKeyId can be either of the following formats:

             

            
            * KMS Key ID: ``"1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"``
             
            * Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a KMS Key: ``"arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"``
            

            
          

          - **VpcConfig** *(dict) --* 

            Configuration parameters for a private Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) containing the resources you are using for your topic detection job. For more information, see `Amazon VPC <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/what-is-amazon-vpc.html>`__.

            
            

            - **SecurityGroupIds** *(list) --* 

              The ID number for a security group on an instance of your private VPC.

This ID number is preceded by "sg-", for instance: "sg-03b388029b0a285ea". For more information, see `Security Groups for your VPC <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html>`__.
