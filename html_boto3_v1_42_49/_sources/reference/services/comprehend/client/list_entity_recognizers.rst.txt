.. py:method:: Comprehend.Client.list_entity_recognizers(**kwargs)

  

  Gets a list of the properties of all entity recognizers that you created, including recognizers currently in training. Allows you to filter the list of recognizers based on criteria such as status and submission time. This call returns up to 500 entity recognizers in the list, with a default number of 100 recognizers in the list.

   

  The results of this list are not in any particular order. Please get the list and sort locally if needed.

              * ``COMPREHEND_CSV``: A CSV file that supplements your training documents. The CSV file contains information about the custom entities that your trained model will detect. The required format of the file depends on whether you are providing annotations or an entity list. If you use this value, you must provide your CSV file by using either the ``Annotations`` or ``EntityList`` parameters. You must provide your training documents by using the ``Documents`` parameter.
               
              * ``AUGMENTED_MANIFEST``: A labeled dataset that is produced by Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth. This file is in JSON lines format. Each line is a complete JSON object that contains a training document and its labels. Each label annotates a named entity in the training document. If you use this value, you must provide the ``AugmentedManifests`` parameter in your request.
              

               

              If you don't specify a value, Amazon Comprehend uses ``COMPREHEND_CSV`` as the default.

                  TRAIN - all of the documents in the manifest will be used for training. If no test documents are provided, Amazon Comprehend will automatically reserve a portion of the training documents for testing.

                   

                  TEST - all of the documents in the manifest will be used for testing.

                A measure of the usefulness of the recognizer results in the test data. High precision means that the recognizer returned substantially more relevant results than irrelevant ones.

                
              

              - **Recall** *(float) --* 

                A measure of how complete the recognizer results are for the test data. High recall means that the recognizer returned most of the relevant results.

                
              

              - **F1Score** *(float) --* 

                A measure of how accurate the recognizer results are for the test data. It is derived from the ``Precision`` and ``Recall`` values. The ``F1Score`` is the harmonic average of the two scores. For plain text entity recognizer models, the range is 0 to 100, where 100 is the best score. For PDF/Word entity recognizer models, the range is 0 to 1, where 1 is the best score.
