.. py:method:: IAM.ServerCertificate.update(**kwargs)

  

  Updates the name and/or the path of the specified server certificate stored in IAM.

   

  For more information about working with server certificates, see `Working with server certificates <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_server-certs.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide*. This topic also includes a list of Amazon Web Services services that can use the server certificates that you manage with IAM.

   

  .. warning::

     

    You should understand the implications of changing a server certificate's path or name. For more information, see `Renaming a server certificate <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_server-certs_manage.html#RenamingServerCerts>`__ in the *IAM User Guide*.

     

   

  .. note::

    

    The person making the request (the principal), must have permission to change the server certificate with the old name and the new name. For example, to change the certificate named ``ProductionCert`` to ``ProdCert``, the principal must have a policy that allows them to update both certificates. If the principal has permission to update the ``ProductionCert`` group, but not the ``ProdCert`` certificate, then the update fails. For more information about permissions, see `Access management <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide*.
