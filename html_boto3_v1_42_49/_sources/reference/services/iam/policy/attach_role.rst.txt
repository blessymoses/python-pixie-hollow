.. py:method:: IAM.Policy.attach_role(**kwargs)

  

  Attaches the specified managed policy to the specified IAM role. When you attach a managed policy to a role, the managed policy becomes part of the role's permission (access) policy.

   

  .. note::

    

    You cannot use a managed policy as the role's trust policy. The role's trust policy is created at the same time as the role, using `CreateRole <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_CreateRole.html>`__. You can update a role's trust policy using `UpdateAssumerolePolicy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateAssumeRolePolicy.html>`__.

    

   

  Use this operation to attach a *managed* policy to a role. To embed an inline policy in a role, use `PutRolePolicy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_PutRolePolicy.html>`__. For more information about policies, see `Managed policies and inline policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide*.

   

  As a best practice, you can validate your IAM policies. To learn more, see `Validating IAM policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_policy-validator.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide*.
