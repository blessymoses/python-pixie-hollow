.. py:method:: IAM.Policy.attach_group(**kwargs)

  

  Attaches the specified managed policy to the specified IAM group.

   

  You use this operation to attach a managed policy to a group. To embed an inline policy in a group, use `PutGroupPolicy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_PutGroupPolicy.html>`__.

   

  As a best practice, you can validate your IAM policies. To learn more, see `Validating IAM policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_policy-validator.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide*.

   

  For more information about policies, see `Managed policies and inline policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide*.
