.. py:method:: IAM.AccessKey.activate()

  

  Changes the status of the specified access key from Active to Inactive, or vice versa. This operation can be used to disable a user's key as part of a key rotation workflow.

   

  If the ``UserName`` is not specified, the user name is determined implicitly based on the Amazon Web Services access key ID used to sign the request. If a temporary access key is used, then ``UserName`` is required. If a long-term key is assigned to the user, then ``UserName`` is not required. This operation works for access keys under the Amazon Web Services account. Consequently, you can use this operation to manage Amazon Web Services account root user credentials even if the Amazon Web Services account has no associated users.

   

  For information about rotating keys, see `Managing keys and certificates <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/ManagingCredentials.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide*.
