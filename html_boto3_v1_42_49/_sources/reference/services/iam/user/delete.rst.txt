.. py:method:: IAM.User.delete()

  

  Deletes the specified IAM user. Unlike the Amazon Web Services Management Console, when you delete a user programmatically, you must delete the items attached to the user manually, or the deletion fails. For more information, see `Deleting an IAM user <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_manage.html#id_users_deleting_cli>`__. Before attempting to delete a user, remove the following items:

   

  
  * Password ( `DeleteLoginProfile <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteLoginProfile.html>`__)
   
  * Access keys ( `DeleteAccessKey <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteAccessKey.html>`__)
   
  * Signing certificate ( `DeleteSigningCertificate <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteSigningCertificate.html>`__)
   
  * SSH public key ( `DeleteSSHPublicKey <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteSSHPublicKey.html>`__)
   
  * Git credentials ( `DeleteServiceSpecificCredential <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteServiceSpecificCredential.html>`__)
   
  * Multi-factor authentication (MFA) device ( `DeactivateMFADevice <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_DeactivateMFADevice.html>`__, `DeleteVirtualMFADevice <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteVirtualMFADevice.html>`__)
   
  * Inline policies ( `DeleteUserPolicy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteUserPolicy.html>`__)
   
  * Attached managed policies ( `DetachUserPolicy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_DetachUserPolicy.html>`__)
   
  * Group memberships ( `RemoveUserFromGroup <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_RemoveUserFromGroup.html>`__)
