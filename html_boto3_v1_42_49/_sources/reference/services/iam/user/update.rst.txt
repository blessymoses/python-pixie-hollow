.. py:method:: IAM.User.update(**kwargs)

  

  Updates the name and/or the path of the specified IAM user.

   

  .. warning::

     

    You should understand the implications of changing an IAM user's path or name. For more information, see `Renaming an IAM user <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_manage.html#id_users_renaming>`__ and `Renaming an IAM group <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_groups_manage_rename.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide*.

     

   

  .. note::

    

    To change a user name, the requester must have appropriate permissions on both the source object and the target object. For example, to change Bob to Robert, the entity making the request must have permission on Bob and Robert, or must have permission on all (*). For more information about permissions, see `Permissions and policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/PermissionsAndPolicies.html>`__.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    user = user.update(
        NewPath='string',
        NewUserName='string'
    )
    
  :type NewPath: string
  :param NewPath: 

    New path for the IAM user. Include this parameter only if you're changing the user's path.

     

    This parameter allows (through its `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__) a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it can contain any ASCII character from the ! ( ``\u0021``) through the DEL character ( ``\u007F``), including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters.

    

  
  :type NewUserName: string
  :param NewUserName: 

    New name for the user. Include this parameter only if you're changing the user's name.

     

    IAM user, group, role, and policy names must be unique within the account. Names are not distinguished by case. For example, you cannot create resources named both "MyResource" and "myresource".
