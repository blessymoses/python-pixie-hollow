.. py:attribute:: IAM.PolicyVersion.document

  

  - *(string) --* 

    The policy document.

     

    The policy document is returned in the response to the `GetPolicyVersion <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_GetPolicyVersion.html>`__ and `GetAccountAuthorizationDetails <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_GetAccountAuthorizationDetails.html>`__ operations. It is not returned in the response to the `CreatePolicyVersion <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_CreatePolicyVersion.html>`__ or `ListPolicyVersions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_ListPolicyVersions.html>`__ operations.

     

    The policy document returned in this structure is URL-encoded compliant with `RFC 3986 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986>`__. You can use a URL decoding method to convert the policy back to plain JSON text. For example, if you use Java, you can use the ``decode`` method of the ``java.net.URLDecoder`` utility class in the Java SDK. Other languages and SDKs provide similar functionality.
