.. py:method:: IAM.PolicyVersion.delete()

  

  Deletes the specified version from the specified managed policy.

   

  You cannot delete the default version from a policy using this operation. To delete the default version from a policy, use `DeletePolicy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_DeletePolicy.html>`__. To find out which version of a policy is marked as the default version, use `ListPolicyVersions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_ListPolicyVersions.html>`__.

   

  For information about versions for managed policies, see `Versioning for managed policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-versions.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide*.
