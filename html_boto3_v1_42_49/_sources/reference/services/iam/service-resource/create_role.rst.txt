  Creates a new role for your Amazon Web Services account.

   

  For more information about roles, see `IAM roles <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide*. For information about quotas for role names and the number of roles you can create, see `IAM and STS quotas <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide*.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    role = iam.create_role(
        Path='string',
        RoleName='string',
        AssumeRolePolicyDocument='string',
        Description='string',
        MaxSessionDuration=123,
        PermissionsBoundary='string',
        Tags=[
            {
                'Key': 'string',
                'Value': 'string'
            },
        ]
    )
    
  :type Path: string
  :param Path: 

    The path to the role. For more information about paths, see `IAM Identifiers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_Identifiers.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide*.

     

    This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash (/).

     

    This parameter allows (through its `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__) a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it can contain any ASCII character from the ! ( ``\u0021``) through the DEL character ( ``\u007F``), including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters.

    

  
  :type RoleName: string
  :param RoleName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of the role to create.

     

    IAM user, group, role, and policy names must be unique within the account. Names are not distinguished by case. For example, you cannot create resources named both "MyResource" and "myresource".

     

    This parameter allows (through its `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__) a string of characters consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: _+=,.@-

    

  
  :type AssumeRolePolicyDocument: string
  :param AssumeRolePolicyDocument: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The trust relationship policy document that grants an entity permission to assume the role.

     

    In IAM, you must provide a JSON policy that has been converted to a string. However, for CloudFormation templates formatted in YAML, you can provide the policy in JSON or YAML format. CloudFormation always converts a YAML policy to JSON format before submitting it to IAM.

     

    The `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of the following:

     

    
    * Any printable ASCII character ranging from the space character ( ``\u0020``) through the end of the ASCII character range
     
    * The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement character set (through ``\u00FF``)
     
    * The special characters tab ( ``\u0009``), line feed ( ``\u000A``), and carriage return ( ``\u000D``)
    

     

    Upon success, the response includes the same trust policy in JSON format.

    

  
  :type Description: string
  :param Description: 

    A description of the role.

    

  
  :type MaxSessionDuration: integer
  :param MaxSessionDuration: 

    The maximum session duration (in seconds) that you want to set for the specified role. If you do not specify a value for this setting, the default value of one hour is applied. This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours.

     

    Anyone who assumes the role from the CLI or API can use the ``DurationSeconds`` API parameter or the ``duration-seconds`` CLI parameter to request a longer session. The ``MaxSessionDuration`` setting determines the maximum duration that can be requested using the ``DurationSeconds`` parameter. If users don't specify a value for the ``DurationSeconds`` parameter, their security credentials are valid for one hour by default. This applies when you use the ``AssumeRole*`` API operations or the ``assume-role*`` CLI operations but does not apply when you use those operations to create a console URL. For more information, see `Using IAM roles <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide*.

    

  
  :type PermissionsBoundary: string
  :param PermissionsBoundary: 

    The ARN of the managed policy that is used to set the permissions boundary for the role.

     

    A permissions boundary policy defines the maximum permissions that identity-based policies can grant to an entity, but does not grant permissions. Permissions boundaries do not define the maximum permissions that a resource-based policy can grant to an entity. To learn more, see `Permissions boundaries for IAM entities <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide*.

     

    For more information about policy types, see `Policy types <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#access_policy-types>`__ in the *IAM User Guide*.

    

  
  :type Tags: list
  :param Tags: 

    A list of tags that you want to attach to the new role. Each tag consists of a key name and an associated value. For more information about tagging, see `Tagging IAM resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide*.

     

    .. note::

      

      If any one of the tags is invalid or if you exceed the allowed maximum number of tags, then the entire request fails and the resource is not created.

      

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      A structure that represents user-provided metadata that can be associated with an IAM resource. For more information about tagging, see `Tagging IAM resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide*.

      

    
      - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The key name that can be used to look up or retrieve the associated value. For example, ``Department`` or ``Cost Center`` are common choices.

        

      
      - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The value associated with this tag. For example, tags with a key name of ``Department`` could have values such as ``Human Resources``, ``Accounting``, and ``Support``. Tags with a key name of ``Cost Center`` might have values that consist of the number associated with the different cost centers in your company. Typically, many resources have tags with the same key name but with different values.
