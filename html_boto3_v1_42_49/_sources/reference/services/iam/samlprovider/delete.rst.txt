.. py:method:: IAM.SamlProvider.delete()

  

  Deletes a SAML provider resource in IAM.

   

  Deleting the provider resource from IAM does not update any roles that reference the SAML provider resource's ARN as a principal in their trust policies. Any attempt to assume a role that references a non-existent provider resource ARN fails.
