.. py:method:: IAM.UserPolicy.put(**kwargs)

  

  Adds or updates an inline policy document that is embedded in the specified IAM user.

   

  An IAM user can also have a managed policy attached to it. To attach a managed policy to a user, use `AttachUserPolicy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_AttachUserPolicy.html>`__. To create a new managed policy, use `CreatePolicy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_CreatePolicy.html>`__. For information about policies, see `Managed policies and inline policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide*.

   

  For information about the maximum number of inline policies that you can embed in a user, see `IAM and STS quotas <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide*.

   

  .. note::

    

    Because policy documents can be large, you should use POST rather than GET when calling ``PutUserPolicy``. For general information about using the Query API with IAM, see `Making query requests <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/IAM_UsingQueryAPI.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide*.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = user_policy.put(
        PolicyDocument='string'
    )
    
  :type PolicyDocument: string
  :param PolicyDocument: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The policy document.

     

    You must provide policies in JSON format in IAM. However, for CloudFormation templates formatted in YAML, you can provide the policy in JSON or YAML format. CloudFormation always converts a YAML policy to JSON format before submitting it to IAM.

     

    The `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of the following:

     

    
    * Any printable ASCII character ranging from the space character ( ``\u0020``) through the end of the ASCII character range
     
    * The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement character set (through ``\u00FF``)
     
    * The special characters tab ( ``\u0009``), line feed ( ``\u000A``), and carriage return ( ``\u000D``)
