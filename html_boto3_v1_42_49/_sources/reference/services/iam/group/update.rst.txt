.. py:method:: IAM.Group.update(**kwargs)

  

  Updates the name and/or the path of the specified IAM group.

   

  .. warning::

     

    You should understand the implications of changing a group's path or name. For more information, see `Renaming users and groups <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_WorkingWithGroupsAndUsers.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide*.

     

   

  .. note::

    

    The person making the request (the principal), must have permission to change the role group with the old name and the new name. For example, to change the group named ``Managers`` to ``MGRs``, the principal must have a policy that allows them to update both groups. If the principal has permission to update the ``Managers`` group, but not the ``MGRs`` group, then the update fails. For more information about permissions, see `Access management <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access.html>`__.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    group = group.update(
        NewPath='string',
        NewGroupName='string'
    )
    
  :type NewPath: string
  :param NewPath: 

    New path for the IAM group. Only include this if changing the group's path.

     

    This parameter allows (through its `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__) a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it can contain any ASCII character from the ! ( ``\u0021``) through the DEL character ( ``\u007F``), including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters.

    

  
  :type NewGroupName: string
  :param NewGroupName: 

    New name for the IAM group. Only include this if changing the group's name.

     

    IAM user, group, role, and policy names must be unique within the account. Names are not distinguished by case. For example, you cannot create resources named both "MyResource" and "myresource".
