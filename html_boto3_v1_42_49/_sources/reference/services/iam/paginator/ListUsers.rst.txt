    **Request Syntax**
    ::

      response_iterator = paginator.paginate(
          PathPrefix='string',
          PaginationConfig={
              'MaxItems': 123,
              'PageSize': 123,
              'StartingToken': 'string'
          }
      )
      
    :type PathPrefix: string
    :param PathPrefix: 

      The path prefix for filtering the results. For example: ``/division_abc/subdivision_xyz/``, which would get all user names whose path starts with ``/division_abc/subdivision_xyz/``.

       

      This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash (/), listing all user names. This parameter allows (through its `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__) a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it can contain any ASCII character from the ! ( ``\u0021``) through the DEL character ( ``\u007F``), including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters.

      

    
    :type PaginationConfig: dict
    :param PaginationConfig: 

      A dictionary that provides parameters to control pagination.

      

    
      - **MaxItems** *(integer) --* 

        The total number of items to return. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified in max-items then a ``NextToken`` will be provided in the output that you can use to resume pagination.

        

      
      - **PageSize** *(integer) --* 

        The size of each page.

        

      
      - **StartingToken** *(string) --* 

        A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previous response.

      **Response Structure**

      

      - *(dict) --* 

        Contains the response to a successful `ListUsers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_ListUsers.html>`__ request.

        
        

        - **Users** *(list) --* 

          A list of users.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            Contains information about an IAM user entity.

             

            This data type is used as a response element in the following operations:

             

            
            * `CreateUser <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_CreateUser.html>`__
             
            * `GetUser <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_GetUser.html>`__
             
            * `ListUsers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_ListUsers.html>`__
            

            
            

            - **Path** *(string) --* 

              The path to the user. For more information about paths, see `IAM identifiers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_Identifiers.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide*.

               

              The ARN of the policy used to set the permissions boundary for the user.

              
            

            - **UserName** *(string) --* 

              The friendly name identifying the user.

              
            

            - **UserId** *(string) --* 

              The stable and unique string identifying the user. For more information about IDs, see `IAM identifiers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_Identifiers.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide*.

              
            

            - **Arn** *(string) --* 

              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that identifies the user. For more information about ARNs and how to use ARNs in policies, see `IAM Identifiers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_Identifiers.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide*.

              
            

            - **CreateDate** *(datetime) --* 

              The date and time, in `ISO 8601 date-time format <http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601>`__, when the user was created.

              
            

            - **PasswordLastUsed** *(datetime) --* 

              The date and time, in `ISO 8601 date-time format <http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601>`__, when the user's password was last used to sign in to an Amazon Web Services website. For a list of Amazon Web Services websites that capture a user's last sign-in time, see the `Credential reports <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/credential-reports.html>`__ topic in the *IAM User Guide*. If a password is used more than once in a five-minute span, only the first use is returned in this field. If the field is null (no value), then it indicates that they never signed in with a password. This can be because:

               

              
              * The user never had a password.
               
              * A password exists but has not been used since IAM started tracking this information on October 20, 2014.
              

               

              A null value does not mean that the user *never* had a password. Also, if the user does not currently have a password but had one in the past, then this field contains the date and time the most recent password was used.

               

              This value is returned only in the `GetUser <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_GetUser.html>`__ and `ListUsers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_ListUsers.html>`__ operations.

              
            

            - **PermissionsBoundary** *(dict) --* 

              For more information about permissions boundaries, see `Permissions boundaries for IAM identities <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide*.

              
              

              - **PermissionsBoundaryType** *(string) --* 

                The permissions boundary usage type that indicates what type of IAM resource is used as the permissions boundary for an entity. This data type can only have a value of ``Policy``.

                
              

              - **PermissionsBoundaryArn** *(string) --* 

                The ARN of the policy used to set the permissions boundary for the user or role.

                
          
            

            - **Tags** *(list) --* 

              A list of tags that are associated with the user. For more information about tagging, see `Tagging IAM resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide*.

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                A structure that represents user-provided metadata that can be associated with an IAM resource. For more information about tagging, see `Tagging IAM resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide*.

                
                

                - **Key** *(string) --* 

                  The key name that can be used to look up or retrieve the associated value. For example, ``Department`` or ``Cost Center`` are common choices.

                  
                

                - **Value** *(string) --* 

                  The value associated with this tag. For example, tags with a key name of ``Department`` could have values such as ``Human Resources``, ``Accounting``, and ``Support``. Tags with a key name of ``Cost Center`` might have values that consist of the number associated with the different cost centers in your company. Typically, many resources have tags with the same key name but with different values.

                  
            
          
        
      
        

        - **IsTruncated** *(boolean) --* 

          A flag that indicates whether there are more items to return. If your results were truncated, you can make a subsequent pagination request using the ``Marker`` request parameter to retrieve more items. Note that IAM might return fewer than the ``MaxItems`` number of results even when there are more results available. We recommend that you check ``IsTruncated`` after every call to ensure that you receive all your results.

          
        

        - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

          A token to resume pagination.
