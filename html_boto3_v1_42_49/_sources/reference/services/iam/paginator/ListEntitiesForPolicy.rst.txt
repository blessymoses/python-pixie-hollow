    **Request Syntax**
    ::

      response_iterator = paginator.paginate(
          PolicyArn='string',
          EntityFilter='User'|'Role'|'Group'|'LocalManagedPolicy'|'AWSManagedPolicy',
          PathPrefix='string',
          PolicyUsageFilter='PermissionsPolicy'|'PermissionsBoundary',
          PaginationConfig={
              'MaxItems': 123,
              'PageSize': 123,
              'StartingToken': 'string'
          }
      )
      
    :type PolicyArn: string
    :param PolicyArn: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM policy for which you want the versions.

       

      For more information about ARNs, see `Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*.

      

    
    :type EntityFilter: string
    :param EntityFilter: 

      The entity type to use for filtering the results.

       

      For example, when ``EntityFilter`` is ``Role``, only the roles that are attached to the specified policy are returned. This parameter is optional. If it is not included, all attached entities (users, groups, and roles) are returned. The argument for this parameter must be one of the valid values listed below.

      

    
    :type PathPrefix: string
    :param PathPrefix: 

      The path prefix for filtering the results. This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash (/), listing all entities.

       

      This parameter allows (through its `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__) a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it can contain any ASCII character from the ! ( ``\u0021``) through the DEL character ( ``\u007F``), including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters.

      

    
    :type PolicyUsageFilter: string
    :param PolicyUsageFilter: 

      The policy usage method to use for filtering the results.

       

      To list only permissions policies, set ``PolicyUsageFilter`` to ``PermissionsPolicy``. To list only the policies used to set permissions boundaries, set the value to ``PermissionsBoundary``.

       

      This parameter is optional. If it is not included, all policies are returned.

      

    
    :type PaginationConfig: dict
    :param PaginationConfig: 

      A dictionary that provides parameters to control pagination.

      

    
      - **MaxItems** *(integer) --* 

        The total number of items to return. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified in max-items then a ``NextToken`` will be provided in the output that you can use to resume pagination.

        

      
      - **PageSize** *(integer) --* 

        The size of each page.

        

      
      - **StartingToken** *(string) --* 

        A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previous response.

If your results were truncated, you can make a subsequent pagination request using the ``Marker`` request parameter to retrieve more items. Note that IAM might return fewer than the ``MaxItems`` number of results even when there are more results available. We recommend that you check ``IsTruncated`` after every call to ensure that you receive all your results.

          
        

        - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

          A token to resume pagination.
