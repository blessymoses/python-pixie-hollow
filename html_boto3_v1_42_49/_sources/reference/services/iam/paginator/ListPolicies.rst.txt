    **Request Syntax**
    ::

      response_iterator = paginator.paginate(
          Scope='All'|'AWS'|'Local',
          OnlyAttached=True|False,
          PathPrefix='string',
          PolicyUsageFilter='PermissionsPolicy'|'PermissionsBoundary',
          PaginationConfig={
              'MaxItems': 123,
              'PageSize': 123,
              'StartingToken': 'string'
          }
      )
      
    :type Scope: string
    :param Scope: 

      The scope to use for filtering the results.

       

      To list only Amazon Web Services managed policies, set ``Scope`` to ``AWS``. To list only the customer managed policies in your Amazon Web Services account, set ``Scope`` to ``Local``.

       

      This parameter is optional. If it is not included, or if it is set to ``All``, all policies are returned.

      

    
    :type OnlyAttached: boolean
    :param OnlyAttached: 

      A flag to filter the results to only the attached policies.

       

      When ``OnlyAttached`` is ``true``, the returned list contains only the policies that are attached to an IAM user, group, or role. When ``OnlyAttached`` is ``false``, or when the parameter is not included, all policies are returned.

      

    
    :type PathPrefix: string
    :param PathPrefix: 

      The path prefix for filtering the results. This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash (/), listing all policies. This parameter allows (through its `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__) a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it can contain any ASCII character from the ! ( ``\u0021``) through the DEL character ( ``\u007F``), including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters.

      

    
    :type PolicyUsageFilter: string
    :param PolicyUsageFilter: 

      The policy usage method to use for filtering the results.

       

      To list only permissions policies, set ``PolicyUsageFilter`` to ``PermissionsPolicy``. To list only the policies used to set permissions boundaries, set the value to ``PermissionsBoundary``.

       

      This parameter is optional. If it is not included, all policies are returned.

      

    
    :type PaginationConfig: dict
    :param PaginationConfig: 

      A dictionary that provides parameters to control pagination.

      

    
      - **MaxItems** *(integer) --* 

        The total number of items to return. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified in max-items then a ``NextToken`` will be provided in the output that you can use to resume pagination.

        

      
      - **PageSize** *(integer) --* 

        The size of each page.

        

      
      - **StartingToken** *(string) --* 

        A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previous response.

        

      
    
    
    :rtype: dict

                  The key name that can be used to look up or retrieve the associated value. For example, ``Department`` or ``Cost Center`` are common choices.

                  
                

                - **Value** *(string) --* 

                  The value associated with this tag. For example, tags with a key name of ``Department`` could have values such as ``Human Resources``, ``Accounting``, and ``Support``. Tags with a key name of ``Cost Center`` might have values that consist of the number associated with the different cost centers in your company. Typically, many resources have tags with the same key name but with different values.

                  
            
          
        
      
        

        - **IsTruncated** *(boolean) --* 

          A flag that indicates whether there are more items to return. If your results were truncated, you can make a subsequent pagination request using the ``Marker`` request parameter to retrieve more items. Note that IAM might return fewer than the ``MaxItems`` number of results even when there are more results available. We recommend that you check ``IsTruncated`` after every call to ensure that you receive all your results.

          
        

        - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

          A token to resume pagination.
