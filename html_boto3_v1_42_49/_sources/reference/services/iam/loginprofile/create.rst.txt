.. py:method:: IAM.LoginProfile.create(**kwargs)

  

  Creates a password for the specified IAM user. A password allows an IAM user to access Amazon Web Services services through the Amazon Web Services Management Console.

   

  You can use the CLI, the Amazon Web Services API, or the **Users** page in the IAM console to create a password for any IAM user. Use `ChangePassword <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_ChangePassword.html>`__ to update your own existing password in the **My Security Credentials** page in the Amazon Web Services Management Console.

   

  For more information about managing passwords, see `Managing passwords <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_ManagingLogins.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide*.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    login_profile = login_profile.create(
        Password='string',
        PasswordResetRequired=True|False
    )
    
  :type Password: string
  :param Password: 

    The new password for the user.

     

    This parameter must be omitted when you make the request with an `AssumeRoot <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRoot.html>`__ session. It is required in all other cases.

     

    The `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ that is used to validate this parameter is a string of characters. That string can include almost any printable ASCII character from the space ( ``\u0020``) through the end of the ASCII character range ( ``\u00FF``). You can also include the tab ( ``\u0009``), line feed ( ``\u000A``), and carriage return ( ``\u000D``) characters. Any of these characters are valid in a password. However, many tools, such as the Amazon Web Services Management Console, might restrict the ability to type certain characters because they have special meaning within that tool.

    

  
  :type PasswordResetRequired: boolean
  :param PasswordResetRequired: 

    Specifies whether the user is required to set a new password on next sign-in.
