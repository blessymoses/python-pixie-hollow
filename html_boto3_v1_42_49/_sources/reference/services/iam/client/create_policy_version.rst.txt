.. py:method:: IAM.Client.create_policy_version(**kwargs)

  

  Creates a new version of the specified managed policy. To update a managed policy, you create a new policy version. A managed policy can have up to five versions. If the policy has five versions, you must delete an existing version using `DeletePolicyVersion <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_DeletePolicyVersion.html>`__ before you create a new version.

   

  Optionally, you can set the new version as the policy's default version. The default version is the version that is in effect for the IAM users, groups, and roles to which the policy is attached.

   

  For more information about managed policy versions, see `Versioning for managed policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-versions.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide*.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.create_policy_version(
        PolicyArn='string',
        PolicyDocument='string',
        SetAsDefault=True|False
    )
    
  :type PolicyArn: string
  :param PolicyArn: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM policy to which you want to add a new version.

     

    For more information about ARNs, see `Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*.

    

  
  :type PolicyDocument: string
  :param PolicyDocument: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The JSON policy document that you want to use as the content for this new version of the policy.

     

    You must provide policies in JSON format in IAM. However, for CloudFormation templates formatted in YAML, you can provide the policy in JSON or YAML format. CloudFormation always converts a YAML policy to JSON format before submitting it to IAM.

     

    The maximum length of the policy document that you can pass in this operation, including whitespace, is listed below. To view the maximum character counts of a managed policy with no whitespaces, see `IAM and STS character quotas <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html#reference_iam-quotas-entity-length>`__.

     

    The `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of the following:

     

    
    * Any printable ASCII character ranging from the space character ( ``\u0020``) through the end of the ASCII character range
     
    * The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement character set (through ``\u00FF``)
     
    * The special characters tab ( ``\u0009``), line feed ( ``\u000A``), and carriage return ( ``\u000D``)
    

    

  
  :type SetAsDefault: boolean
  :param SetAsDefault: 

    Specifies whether to set this version as the policy's default version.

     

    When this parameter is ``true``, the new policy version becomes the operative version. That is, it becomes the version that is in effect for the IAM users, groups, and roles that the policy is attached to.

     

    For more information about managed policy versions, see `Versioning for managed policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-versions.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide*.

    **Response Syntax**

    
    ::

      {
          'PolicyVersion': {
              'Document': 'string',
              'VersionId': 'string',
              'IsDefaultVersion': True|False,

          }
      }
      
    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 

      Contains the response to a successful `CreatePolicyVersion <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_CreatePolicyVersion.html>`__ request.

      
      

      - **PolicyVersion** *(dict) --* 

        A structure containing details about the new policy version.

        
        

        - **Document** *(string) --* 

          The policy document.

           

          The policy document is returned in the response to the `GetPolicyVersion <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_GetPolicyVersion.html>`__ and `GetAccountAuthorizationDetails <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_GetAccountAuthorizationDetails.html>`__ operations. It is not returned in the response to the `CreatePolicyVersion <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_CreatePolicyVersion.html>`__ or `ListPolicyVersions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_ListPolicyVersions.html>`__ operations.

           

          The policy document returned in this structure is URL-encoded compliant with `RFC 3986 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986>`__. You can use a URL decoding method to convert the policy back to plain JSON text. For example, if you use Java, you can use the ``decode`` method of the ``java.net.URLDecoder`` utility class in the Java SDK. Other languages and SDKs provide similar functionality.

          
        

        - **VersionId** *(string) --* 

          The identifier for the policy version.

           

          Policy version identifiers always begin with ``v`` (always lowercase). When a policy is created, the first policy version is ``v1``.

          
        

        - **IsDefaultVersion** *(boolean) --* 

          Specifies whether the policy version is set as the policy's default version.

          
        

        - **CreateDate** *(datetime) --* 

          The date and time, in `ISO 8601 date-time format <http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601>`__, when the policy version was created.
