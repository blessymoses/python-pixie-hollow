.. py:method:: IAM.Client.put_user_permissions_boundary(**kwargs)

  

  Adds or updates the policy that is specified as the IAM user's permissions boundary. You can use an Amazon Web Services managed policy or a customer managed policy to set the boundary for a user. Use the boundary to control the maximum permissions that the user can have. Setting a permissions boundary is an advanced feature that can affect the permissions for the user.

   

  .. warning::

     

    Policies that are used as permissions boundaries do not provide permissions. You must also attach a permissions policy to the user. To learn how the effective permissions for a user are evaluated, see `IAM JSON policy evaluation logic <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_evaluation-logic.html>`__ in the IAM User Guide.

    )

    A permissions boundary policy defines the maximum permissions that identity-based policies can grant to an entity, but does not grant permissions. Permissions boundaries do not define the maximum permissions that a resource-based policy can grant to an entity. To learn more, see `Permissions boundaries for IAM entities <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide*.

     

    For more information about policy types, see `Policy types <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#access_policy-types>`__ in the *IAM User Guide*.
