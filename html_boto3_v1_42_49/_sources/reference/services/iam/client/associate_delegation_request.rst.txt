.. py:method:: IAM.Client.associate_delegation_request(**kwargs)

  

  Associates a delegation request with the current identity.

   

  If the partner that created the delegation request has specified the owner account during creation, only an identity from that owner account can call the ``AssociateDelegationRequest`` API for the specified delegation request. Once the ``AssociateDelegationRequest`` API call is successful, the ARN of the current calling identity will be stored as the ``ownerId`` of the request.

   

  If the partner that created the delegation request has not specified the owner account during creation, any caller from any account can call the ``AssociateDelegationRequest`` API for the delegation request. Once this API call is successful, the ARN of the current calling identity will be stored as the ``ownerId`` and the Amazon Web Services account ID of the current calling identity will be stored as the ``ownerAccount`` of the request.
