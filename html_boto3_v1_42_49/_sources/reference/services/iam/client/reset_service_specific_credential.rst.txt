.. py:method:: IAM.Client.reset_service_specific_credential(**kwargs)

        A structure with details about the updated service-specific credential, including the new password.

         

        .. warning::

           

          This is the **only** time that you can access the password. You cannot recover the password later, but you can reset it again.

        - **ExpirationDate** *(datetime) --*

        - **ServiceUserName** *(string) --* 

          The generated user name for the service-specific credential. This value is generated by combining the IAM user's name combined with the ID number of the Amazon Web Services account, as in ``jane-at-123456789012``, for example. This value cannot be configured by the user.

        - **ServiceCredentialSecret** *(string) --* 

          For Bedrock API keys, this is the secret portion of the credential that should be used to authenticate API calls. This value is returned only when the credential is created.

          
        

        - **ServiceSpecificCredentialId** *(string) --*
