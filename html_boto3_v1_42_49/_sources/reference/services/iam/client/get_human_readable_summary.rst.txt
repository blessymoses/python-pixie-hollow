.. py:method:: IAM.Client.get_human_readable_summary(**kwargs)

  

  Retrieves a human readable summary for a given entity. At this time, the only supported entity type is ``delegation-request``

   

  This method uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate the summary.

   

  If a delegation request has no owner or owner account, ``GetHumanReadableSummary`` for that delegation request can be called by any account. If the owner account is assigned but there is no owner id, only identities within that owner account can call ``GetHumanReadableSummary`` for the delegation request to retrieve a summary of that request. Once the delegation request is fully owned, the owner of the request gets a default permission to get that delegation request. For more details, read `default permissions granted to delegation requests. These rules are identical to `GetDelegationRequest <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_GetDelegationRequest.html>`__ API behavior, such that a party who has permissions to call `GetDelegationRequest <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_GetDelegationRequest.html>`__ for a given delegation request will always be able to retrieve the human readable summary for that request.
