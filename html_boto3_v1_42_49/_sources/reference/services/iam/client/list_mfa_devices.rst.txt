.. py:method:: IAM.Client.list_mfa_devices(**kwargs)

  

  Lists the MFA devices for an IAM user. If the request includes a IAM user name, then this operation lists all the MFA devices associated with the specified user. If you do not specify a user name, IAM determines the user name implicitly based on the Amazon Web Services access key ID signing the request for this operation.

   

  You can paginate the results using the ``MaxItems`` and ``Marker`` parameters.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_mfa_devices(
        UserName='string',
        Marker='string',
        MaxItems=123
    )
    
  :type UserName: string
  :param UserName: 

    The name of the user whose MFA devices you want to list.

     

    This parameter allows (through its `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__) a string of characters consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: _+=,.@-

    

  
  :type Marker: string
  :param Marker: 

    Use this parameter only when paginating results and only after you receive a response indicating that the results are truncated. Set it to the value of the ``Marker`` element in the response that you received to indicate where the next call should start.

    

  
  :type MaxItems: integer
  :param MaxItems: 

    Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum number of items you want in the response. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the ``IsTruncated`` response element is ``true``.

     

    If you do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more results available. In that case, the ``IsTruncated`` response element returns ``true``, and ``Marker`` contains a value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.

    **Response Syntax**

    
    ::

      {
          'MFADevices': [
              {
                  'UserName': 'string',
                  'SerialNumber': 'string',
                  'EnableDate': datetime(2015, 1, 1)

      }
      
    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 

      Contains the response to a successful `ListMFADevices <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_ListMFADevices.html>`__ request.

      
      

      - **MFADevices** *(list) --* 

        A list of MFA devices.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          Contains information about an MFA device.

           

          This data type is used as a response element in the `ListMFADevices <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_ListMFADevices.html>`__ operation.

          
          

          - **UserName** *(string) --* 

            The user with whom the MFA device is associated.

            
          

          - **SerialNumber** *(string) --* 

            The serial number that uniquely identifies the MFA device. For virtual MFA devices, the serial number is the device ARN.

            
          

          - **EnableDate** *(datetime) --* 

            The date when the MFA device was enabled for the user.

            
      
    
      

      - **IsTruncated** *(boolean) --* 

        A flag that indicates whether there are more items to return. If your results were truncated, you can make a subsequent pagination request using the ``Marker`` request parameter to retrieve more items. Note that IAM might return fewer than the ``MaxItems`` number of results even when there are more results available. We recommend that you check ``IsTruncated`` after every call to ensure that you receive all your results.

        
      

      - **Marker** *(string) --* 

        When ``IsTruncated`` is ``true``, this element is present and contains the value to use for the ``Marker`` parameter in a subsequent pagination request.
