.. py:method:: IAM.Client.create_open_id_connect_provider(**kwargs)

  

  Creates an IAM entity to describe an identity provider (IdP) that supports `OpenID Connect (OIDC) <http://openid.net/connect/>`__.

   

  The OIDC provider that you create with this operation can be used as a principal in a role's trust policy. Such a policy establishes a trust relationship between Amazon Web Services and the OIDC provider.

   

  If you are using an OIDC identity provider from Google, Facebook, or Amazon Cognito, you don't need to create a separate IAM identity provider. These OIDC identity providers are already built-in to Amazon Web Services and are available for your use. Instead, you can move directly to creating new roles using your identity provider. To learn more, see `Creating a role for web identity or OpenID connect federation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-idp_oidc.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide*.

   

  When you create the IAM OIDC provider, you specify the following:

   

  
  * The URL of the OIDC identity provider (IdP) to trust
   
  * A list of client IDs (also known as audiences) that identify the application or applications allowed to authenticate using the OIDC provider
   
  * A list of tags that are attached to the specified IAM OIDC provider
   
  * A list of thumbprints of one or more server certificates that the IdP uses
  

   

  You get all of this information from the OIDC IdP you want to use to access Amazon Web Services.

   

  .. note::

    

    Amazon Web Services secures communication with OIDC identity providers (IdPs) using our library of trusted root certificate authorities (CAs) to verify the JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) endpoint's TLS certificate. If your OIDC IdP relies on a certificate that is not signed by one of these trusted CAs, only then we secure communication using the thumbprints set in the IdP's configuration.

    

   

  .. note::

    

    The trust for the OIDC provider is derived from the IAM provider that this operation creates. Therefore, it is best to limit access to the `CreateOpenIDConnectProvider <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_CreateOpenIDConnectProvider.html>`__ operation to highly privileged users.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.create_open_id_connect_provider(
        Url='string',
        ClientIDList=[
            'string',
        ],
        ThumbprintList=[
            'string',
        ],
        Tags=[
            {
                'Key': 'string',
                'Value': 'string'
            },
        ]
    )
    
  :type Url: string
  :param Url: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The URL of the identity provider. The URL must begin with ``https://`` and should correspond to the ``iss`` claim in the provider's OpenID Connect ID tokens. Per the OIDC standard, path components are allowed but query parameters are not. Typically the URL consists of only a hostname, like ``https://server.example.org`` or ``https://example.com``. The URL should not contain a port number.

     

    You cannot register the same provider multiple times in a single Amazon Web Services account. If you try to submit a URL that has already been used for an OpenID Connect provider in the Amazon Web Services account, you will get an error.

    

  
  :type ClientIDList: list
  :param ClientIDList: 

    Provides a list of client IDs, also known as audiences. When a mobile or web app registers with an OpenID Connect provider, they establish a value that identifies the application. This is the value that's sent as the ``client_id`` parameter on OAuth requests.

     

    You can register multiple client IDs with the same provider. For example, you might have multiple applications that use the same OIDC provider. You cannot register more than 100 client IDs with a single IAM OIDC provider.

     

    There is no defined format for a client ID. The ``CreateOpenIDConnectProviderRequest`` operation accepts client IDs up to 255 characters long.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type ThumbprintList: list
  :param ThumbprintList: 

    A list of server certificate thumbprints for the OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider's server certificates. Typically this list includes only one entry. However, IAM lets you have up to five thumbprints for an OIDC provider. This lets you maintain multiple thumbprints if the identity provider is rotating certificates.

     

    This parameter is optional. If it is not included, IAM will retrieve and use the top intermediate certificate authority (CA) thumbprint of the OpenID Connect identity provider server certificate.

     

    The server certificate thumbprint is the hex-encoded SHA-1 hash value of the X.509 certificate used by the domain where the OpenID Connect provider makes its keys available. It is always a 40-character string.

     

    For example, assume that the OIDC provider is ``server.example.com`` and the provider stores its keys at https://keys.server.example.com/openid-connect. In that case, the thumbprint string would be the hex-encoded SHA-1 hash value of the certificate used by ``https://keys.server.example.com.``

     

    For more information about obtaining the OIDC provider thumbprint, see `Obtaining the thumbprint for an OpenID Connect provider <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/identity-providers-oidc-obtain-thumbprint.html>`__ in the *IAM user Guide*.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

      Contains a thumbprint for an identity provider's server certificate.

       

      The identity provider's server certificate thumbprint is the hex-encoded SHA-1 hash value of the self-signed X.509 certificate. This thumbprint is used by the domain where the OpenID Connect provider makes its keys available. The thumbprint is always a 40-character string.

      

    

  :type Tags: list
  :param Tags: 

    A list of tags that you want to attach to the new IAM OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider. Each tag consists of a key name and an associated value. For more information about tagging, see `Tagging IAM resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide*.

     

    .. note::

      

      If any one of the tags is invalid or if you exceed the allowed maximum number of tags, then the entire request fails and the resource is not created.

      

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      A structure that represents user-provided metadata that can be associated with an IAM resource. For more information about tagging, see `Tagging IAM resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide*.

      

    
      - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The key name that can be used to look up or retrieve the associated value. For example, ``Department`` or ``Cost Center`` are common choices.

        

      
      - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The value associated with this tag. For example, tags with a key name of ``Department`` could have values such as ``Human Resources``, ``Accounting``, and ``Support``. Tags with a key name of ``Cost Center`` might have values that consist of the number associated with the different cost centers in your company. Typically, many resources have tags with the same key name but with different values.
