.. py:method:: IAM.Client.get_organizations_access_report(**kwargs)

  

  Retrieves the service last accessed data report for Organizations that was previously generated using the ``GenerateOrganizationsAccessReport`` operation. This operation retrieves the status of your report job and the report contents.

   

  Depending on the parameters that you passed when you generated the report, the data returned could include different information. For details, see `GenerateOrganizationsAccessReport <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_GenerateOrganizationsAccessReport.html>`__.

   

  To call this operation, you must be signed in to the management account in your organization. SCPs must be enabled for your organization root. You must have permissions to perform this operation. For more information, see `Refining permissions using service last accessed data <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide*.

   

  For each service that principals in an account (root user, IAM users, or IAM roles) could access using SCPs, the operation returns details about the most recent access attempt. If there was no attempt, the service is listed without details about the most recent attempt to access the service. If the operation fails, it returns the reason that it failed.

   

  By default, the list is sorted by service namespace.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.get_organizations_access_report(
        JobId='string',
        MaxItems=123,
        Marker='string',
        SortKey='SERVICE_NAMESPACE_ASCENDING'|'SERVICE_NAMESPACE_DESCENDING'|'LAST_AUTHENTICATED_TIME_ASCENDING'|'LAST_AUTHENTICATED_TIME_DESCENDING'
    )
    
  :type JobId: string
  :param JobId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The identifier of the request generated by the `GenerateOrganizationsAccessReport <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_GenerateOrganizationsAccessReport.html>`__ operation.

    

  
  :type MaxItems: integer
  :param MaxItems: 

    Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum number of items you want in the response. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the ``IsTruncated`` response element is ``true``.

     

    If you do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more results available. In that case, the ``IsTruncated`` response element returns ``true``, and ``Marker`` contains a value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.

    

  
  :type Marker: string
  :param Marker: 

    Use this parameter only when paginating results and only after you receive a response indicating that the results are truncated. Set it to the value of the ``Marker`` element in the response that you received to indicate where the next call should start.

    

  
  :type SortKey: string
  :param SortKey: 

    The key that is used to sort the results. If you choose the namespace key, the results are returned in alphabetical order. If you choose the time key, the results are sorted numerically by the date and time.

      - **JobCreationDate** *(datetime) --* 

        The date and time, in `ISO 8601 date-time format <http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601>`__, when the report job was created.

        
      

      - **JobCompletionDate** *(datetime) --* 

        The date and time, in `ISO 8601 date-time format <http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601>`__, when the generated report job was completed or failed.

         

        This field is null if the job is still in progress, as indicated by a job status value of ``IN_PROGRESS``.

        
      

      - **NumberOfServicesAccessible** *(integer) --* 

        The number of services that the applicable SCPs allow account principals to access.

        - *(dict) --* 

          An object that contains details about when a principal in the reported Organizations entity last attempted to access an Amazon Web Services service. A principal can be an IAM user, an IAM role, or the Amazon Web Services account root user within the reported Organizations entity.

           

          This data type is a response element in the `GetOrganizationsAccessReport <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_GetOrganizationsAccessReport.html>`__ operation.

          
          

          - **ServiceName** *(string) --* 

            The name of the service in which access was attempted.

            The namespace of the service in which access was attempted.

             

            To learn the service namespace of a service, see `Actions, resources, and condition keys for Amazon Web Services services <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/reference_policies_actions-resources-contextkeys.html>`__ in the *Service Authorization Reference*. Choose the name of the service to view details for that service. In the first paragraph, find the service prefix. For example, ``(service prefix: a4b)``. For more information about service namespaces, see `Amazon Web Services service namespaces <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html#genref-aws-service-namespaces>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*.

            The Region where the last service access attempt occurred.

             

            This field is null if no principals in the reported Organizations entity attempted to access the service within the `tracking period <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html#service-last-accessed-reporting-period>`__.

            
          

          - **EntityPath** *(string) --* 

            The path of the Organizations entity (root, organizational unit, or account) from which an authenticated principal last attempted to access the service. Amazon Web Services does not report unauthenticated requests.

             

            This field is null if no principals (IAM users, IAM roles, or root user) in the reported Organizations entity attempted to access the service within the `tracking period <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html#service-last-accessed-reporting-period>`__.

            
          

          - **LastAuthenticatedTime** *(datetime) --* 

            The date and time, in  `ISO 8601 date-time format <http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601>`__, when an authenticated principal most recently attempted to access the service. Amazon Web Services does not report unauthenticated requests.

             

            This field is null if no principals in the reported Organizations entity attempted to access the service within the `tracking period <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html#service-last-accessed-reporting-period>`__.

      - **IsTruncated** *(boolean) --* 

        A flag that indicates whether there are more items to return. If your results were truncated, you can make a subsequent pagination request using the ``Marker`` request parameter to retrieve more items. Note that IAM might return fewer than the ``MaxItems`` number of results even when there are more results available. We recommend that you check ``IsTruncated`` after every call to ensure that you receive all your results.

        
      

      - **Marker** *(string) --* 

        When ``IsTruncated`` is ``true``, this element is present and contains the value to use for the ``Marker`` parameter in a subsequent pagination request.

        
      

      - **ErrorDetails** *(dict) --* 

        Contains information about the reason that the operation failed.

         

        This data type is used as a response element in the `GetOrganizationsAccessReport <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_GetOrganizationsAccessReport.html>`__, `GetServiceLastAccessedDetails <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_GetServiceLastAccessedDetails.html>`__, and `GetServiceLastAccessedDetailsWithEntities <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_GetServiceLastAccessedDetailsWithEntities.html>`__ operations.

        
        

        - **Message** *(string) --* 

          Detailed information about the reason that the operation failed.

          
        

        - **Code** *(string) --*
