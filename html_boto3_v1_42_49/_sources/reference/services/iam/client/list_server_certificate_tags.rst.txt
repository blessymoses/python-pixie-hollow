.. py:method:: IAM.Client.list_server_certificate_tags(**kwargs)

  

  Lists the tags that are attached to the specified IAM server certificate. The returned list of tags is sorted by tag key. For more information about tagging, see `Tagging IAM resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide*.

   

  .. note::

    

    For certificates in a Region supported by Certificate Manager (ACM), we recommend that you don't use IAM server certificates. Instead, use ACM to provision, manage, and deploy your server certificates. For more information about IAM server certificates, `Working with server certificates <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_server-certs.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide*.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_server_certificate_tags(
        ServerCertificateName='string',
        Marker='string',
        MaxItems=123
    )
    
  :type ServerCertificateName: string
  :param ServerCertificateName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of the IAM server certificate whose tags you want to see.

     

    This parameter allows (through its `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__) a string of characters consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: _+=,.@-

    

  
  :type Marker: string
  :param Marker: 

    Use this parameter only when paginating results and only after you receive a response indicating that the results are truncated. Set it to the value of the ``Marker`` element in the response that you received to indicate where the next call should start.

    

  
  :type MaxItems: integer
  :param MaxItems: 

    Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum number of items you want in the response. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the ``IsTruncated`` response element is ``true``.

     

    If you do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more results available. In that case, the ``IsTruncated`` response element returns ``true``, and ``Marker`` contains a value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.

    **Response Syntax**

    
    ::

      {
          'Tags': [
              {
                  'Key': 'string',
                  'Value': 'string'
              },
          ],
          'IsTruncated': True|False,
          'Marker': 'string'
      }
      
    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **Tags** *(list) --* 

        The list of tags that are currently attached to the IAM server certificate. Each tag consists of a key name and an associated value. If no tags are attached to the specified resource, the response contains an empty list.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          A structure that represents user-provided metadata that can be associated with an IAM resource. For more information about tagging, see `Tagging IAM resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide*.

          
          

          - **Key** *(string) --* 

            The key name that can be used to look up or retrieve the associated value. For example, ``Department`` or ``Cost Center`` are common choices.

            
          

          - **Value** *(string) --* 

            The value associated with this tag. For example, tags with a key name of ``Department`` could have values such as ``Human Resources``, ``Accounting``, and ``Support``. Tags with a key name of ``Cost Center`` might have values that consist of the number associated with the different cost centers in your company. Typically, many resources have tags with the same key name but with different values.

            
      
    
      

      - **IsTruncated** *(boolean) --* 

        A flag that indicates whether there are more items to return. If your results were truncated, you can make a subsequent pagination request using the ``Marker`` request parameter to retrieve more items. Note that IAM might return fewer than the ``MaxItems`` number of results even when there are more results available. We recommend that you check ``IsTruncated`` after every call to ensure that you receive all your results.

        
      

      - **Marker** *(string) --* 

        When ``IsTruncated`` is ``true``, this element is present and contains the value to use for the ``Marker`` parameter in a subsequent pagination request.
