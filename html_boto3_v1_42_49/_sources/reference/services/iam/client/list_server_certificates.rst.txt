.. py:method:: IAM.Client.list_server_certificates(**kwargs)

  

  Lists the server certificates stored in IAM that have the specified path prefix. If none exist, the operation returns an empty list.

   

  You can paginate the results using the ``MaxItems`` and ``Marker`` parameters.

   

  For more information about working with server certificates, see `Working with server certificates <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_server-certs.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide*. This topic also includes a list of Amazon Web Services services that can use the server certificates that you manage with IAM.

   

  .. note::

    

    IAM resource-listing operations return a subset of the available attributes for the resource. For example, this operation does not return tags, even though they are an attribute of the returned object. To view all of the information for a servercertificate, see `GetServerCertificate <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_GetServerCertificate.html>`__.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_server_certificates(
        PathPrefix='string',
        Marker='string',
        MaxItems=123
    )
    
  :type PathPrefix: string
  :param PathPrefix: 

    The path prefix for filtering the results. For example: ``/company/servercerts`` would get all server certificates for which the path starts with ``/company/servercerts``.

     

    This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash (/), listing all server certificates. This parameter allows (through its `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__) a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it can contain any ASCII character from the ! ( ``\u0021``) through the DEL character ( ``\u007F``), including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters.

    

  
  :type Marker: string
  :param Marker: 

    Use this parameter only when paginating results and only after you receive a response indicating that the results are truncated. Set it to the value of the ``Marker`` element in the response that you received to indicate where the next call should start.

    

  
  :type MaxItems: integer
  :param MaxItems: 

    Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum number of items you want in the response. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the ``IsTruncated`` response element is ``true``.

     

    If you do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more results available. In that case, the ``IsTruncated`` response element returns ``true``, and ``Marker`` contains a value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 

      Contains the response to a successful `ListServerCertificates <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_ListServerCertificates.html>`__ request.

      
      

      - **ServerCertificateMetadataList** *(list) --* 

        A list of server certificates.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          Contains information about a server certificate without its certificate body, certificate chain, and private key.

           

          This data type is used as a response element in the `UploadServerCertificate <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_UploadServerCertificate.html>`__ and `ListServerCertificates <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_ListServerCertificates.html>`__ operations.

          
          

          - **Path** *(string) --* 

            The path to the server certificate. For more information about paths, see `IAM identifiers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_Identifiers.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide*.

            
          

          - **ServerCertificateName** *(string) --* 

            The name that identifies the server certificate.

            
          

          - **ServerCertificateId** *(string) --* 

            The stable and unique string identifying the server certificate. For more information about IDs, see `IAM identifiers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_Identifiers.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide*.

            
          

          - **Arn** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) specifying the server certificate. For more information about ARNs and how to use them in policies, see `IAM identifiers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_Identifiers.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide*.

            
          

          - **UploadDate** *(datetime) --* 

            The date when the server certificate was uploaded.

            
          

          - **Expiration** *(datetime) --* 

            The date on which the certificate is set to expire.

            
      
    
      

      - **IsTruncated** *(boolean) --* 

        A flag that indicates whether there are more items to return. If your results were truncated, you can make a subsequent pagination request using the ``Marker`` request parameter to retrieve more items. Note that IAM might return fewer than the ``MaxItems`` number of results even when there are more results available. We recommend that you check ``IsTruncated`` after every call to ensure that you receive all your results.

        
      

      - **Marker** *(string) --* 

        When ``IsTruncated`` is ``true``, this element is present and contains the value to use for the ``Marker`` parameter in a subsequent pagination request.
