.. py:method:: IAM.Client.list_attached_user_policies(**kwargs)

  

  Lists all managed policies that are attached to the specified IAM user.

   

  An IAM user can also have inline policies embedded with it. To list the inline policies for a user, use `ListUserPolicies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_ListUserPolicies.html>`__. For information about policies, see `Managed policies and inline policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide*.

   

  You can paginate the results using the ``MaxItems`` and ``Marker`` parameters. You can use the ``PathPrefix`` parameter to limit the list of policies to only those matching the specified path prefix. If there are no policies attached to the specified group (or none that match the specified path prefix), the operation returns an empty list.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_attached_user_policies(
        UserName='string',
        PathPrefix='string',
        Marker='string',
        MaxItems=123
    )
    
  :type UserName: string
  :param UserName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name (friendly name, not ARN) of the user to list attached policies for.

     

    This parameter allows (through its `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__) a string of characters consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: _+=,.@-

    

  
  :type PathPrefix: string
  :param PathPrefix: 

    The path prefix for filtering the results. This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash (/), listing all policies.

     

    This parameter allows (through its `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__) a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it can contain any ASCII character from the ! ( ``\u0021``) through the DEL character ( ``\u007F``), including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters.

    

  
  :type Marker: string
  :param Marker: 

    Use this parameter only when paginating results and only after you receive a response indicating that the results are truncated. Set it to the value of the ``Marker`` element in the response that you received to indicate where the next call should start.

    

  
  :type MaxItems: integer
  :param MaxItems: 

    Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum number of items you want in the response. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the ``IsTruncated`` response element is ``true``.

     

    If you do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more results available. In that case, the ``IsTruncated`` response element returns ``true``, and ``Marker`` contains a value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.

    ::

      {
          'AttachedPolicies': [
              {

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 

      Contains the response to a successful `ListAttachedUserPolicies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_ListAttachedUserPolicies.html>`__ request.

      
      

      - **AttachedPolicies** *(list) --* 

        A list of the attached policies.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          Contains information about an attached policy.

           

          An attached policy is a managed policy that has been attached to a user, group, or role. This data type is used as a response element in the `ListAttachedGroupPolicies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_ListAttachedGroupPolicies.html>`__, `ListAttachedRolePolicies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_ListAttachedRolePolicies.html>`__, `ListAttachedUserPolicies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_ListAttachedUserPolicies.html>`__, and `GetAccountAuthorizationDetails <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_GetAccountAuthorizationDetails.html>`__ operations.

           

          For more information about managed policies, refer to `Managed policies and inline policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide*.

          
          

          - **PolicyName** *(string) --* 

            The friendly name of the attached policy.

            
          

          - **PolicyArn** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN). ARNs are unique identifiers for Amazon Web Services resources.

             

            For more information about ARNs, go to `Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*.

            
      
    
      

      - **IsTruncated** *(boolean) --* 

        A flag that indicates whether there are more items to return. If your results were truncated, you can make a subsequent pagination request using the ``Marker`` request parameter to retrieve more items. Note that IAM might return fewer than the ``MaxItems`` number of results even when there are more results available. We recommend that you check ``IsTruncated`` after every call to ensure that you receive all your results.

        
      

      - **Marker** *(string) --* 

        When ``IsTruncated`` is ``true``, this element is present and contains the value to use for the ``Marker`` parameter in a subsequent pagination request.
