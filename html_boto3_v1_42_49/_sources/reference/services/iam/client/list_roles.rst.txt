.. py:method:: IAM.Client.list_roles(**kwargs)

  

  Lists the IAM roles that have the specified path prefix. If there are none, the operation returns an empty list. For more information about roles, see `IAM roles <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide*.

   

  .. note::

    

    IAM resource-listing operations return a subset of the available attributes for the resource. This operation does not return the following attributes, even though they are an attribute of the returned object:

     

    
    * PermissionsBoundary
     
    * RoleLastUsed
     
    * Tags
    

     

    To view all of the information for a role, see `GetRole <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_GetRole.html>`__.

    

   

  You can paginate the results using the ``MaxItems`` and ``Marker`` parameters.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_roles(
        PathPrefix='string',
        Marker='string',
        MaxItems=123
    )
    
  :type PathPrefix: string
  :param PathPrefix: 

    The path prefix for filtering the results. For example, the prefix ``/application_abc/component_xyz/`` gets all roles whose path starts with ``/application_abc/component_xyz/``.

     

    This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash (/), listing all roles. This parameter allows (through its `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__) a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it can contain any ASCII character from the ! ( ``\u0021``) through the DEL character ( ``\u007F``), including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters.

    

  
  :type Marker: string
  :param Marker: 

    Use this parameter only when paginating results and only after you receive a response indicating that the results are truncated. Set it to the value of the ``Marker`` element in the response that you received to indicate where the next call should start.

    

  
  :type MaxItems: integer
  :param MaxItems: 

    Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum number of items you want in the response. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the ``IsTruncated`` response element is ``true``.

     

    If you do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more results available. In that case, the ``IsTruncated`` response element returns ``true``, and ``Marker`` contains a value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.

Tags with a key name of ``Cost Center`` might have values that consist of the number associated with the different cost centers in your company. Typically, many resources have tags with the same key name but with different values.

                
          
        
          

          - **RoleLastUsed** *(dict) --* 

            Contains information about the last time that an IAM role was used. This includes the date and time and the Region in which the role was last used. Activity is only reported for the trailing 400 days. This period can be shorter if your Region began supporting these features within the last year. The role might have been used more than 400 days ago. For more information, see `Regions where data is tracked <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html#access-advisor_tracking-period>`__ in the *IAM user Guide*.

            
            

            - **LastUsedDate** *(datetime) --* 

              The date and time, in  `ISO 8601 date-time format <http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601>`__ that the role was last used.

               

              This field is null if the role has not been used within the IAM tracking period. For more information about the tracking period, see `Regions where data is tracked <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html#access-advisor_tracking-period>`__ in the *IAM User Guide*.

              
            

            - **Region** *(string) --* 

              The name of the Amazon Web Services Region in which the role was last used.

              
        
      
    
      

      - **IsTruncated** *(boolean) --* 

        A flag that indicates whether there are more items to return. If your results were truncated, you can make a subsequent pagination request using the ``Marker`` request parameter to retrieve more items. Note that IAM might return fewer than the ``MaxItems`` number of results even when there are more results available. We recommend that you check ``IsTruncated`` after every call to ensure that you receive all your results.

        
      

      - **Marker** *(string) --* 

        When ``IsTruncated`` is ``true``, this element is present and contains the value to use for the ``Marker`` parameter in a subsequent pagination request.
