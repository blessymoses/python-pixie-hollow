.. py:method:: IAM.Client.update_open_id_connect_provider_thumbprint(**kwargs)

  

  Replaces the existing list of server certificate thumbprints associated with an OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider resource object with a new list of thumbprints.

   

  The list that you pass with this operation completely replaces the existing list of thumbprints. (The lists are not merged.)

   

  Typically, you need to update a thumbprint only when the identity provider certificate changes, which occurs rarely. However, if the provider's certificate *does* change, any attempt to assume an IAM role that specifies the OIDC provider as a principal fails until the certificate thumbprint is updated.

   

  .. note::

    

    Amazon Web Services secures communication with OIDC identity providers (IdPs) using our library of trusted root certificate authorities (CAs) to verify the JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) endpoint's TLS certificate. If your OIDC IdP relies on a certificate that is not signed by one of these trusted CAs, only then we secure communication using the thumbprints set in the IdP's configuration.

    

   

  .. note::

    

    Trust for the OIDC provider is derived from the provider certificate and is validated by the thumbprint. Therefore, it is best to limit access to the ``UpdateOpenIDConnectProviderThumbprint`` operation to highly privileged users.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.update_open_id_connect_provider_thumbprint(
        OpenIDConnectProviderArn='string',
        ThumbprintList=[
            'string',
        ]
    )
    
  :type OpenIDConnectProviderArn: string
  :param OpenIDConnectProviderArn: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM OIDC provider resource object for which you want to update the thumbprint. You can get a list of OIDC provider ARNs by using the `ListOpenIDConnectProviders <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_ListOpenIDConnectProviders.html>`__ operation.

     

    For more information about ARNs, see `Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*.

    

  
  :type ThumbprintList: list
  :param ThumbprintList: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A list of certificate thumbprints that are associated with the specified IAM OpenID Connect provider. For more information, see `CreateOpenIDConnectProvider <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_CreateOpenIDConnectProvider.html>`__.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

      Contains a thumbprint for an identity provider's server certificate.

       

      The identity provider's server certificate thumbprint is the hex-encoded SHA-1 hash value of the self-signed X.509 certificate. This thumbprint is used by the domain where the OpenID Connect provider makes its keys available. The thumbprint is always a 40-character string.
