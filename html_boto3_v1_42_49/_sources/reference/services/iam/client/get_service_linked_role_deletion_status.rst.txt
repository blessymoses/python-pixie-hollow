.. py:method:: IAM.Client.get_service_linked_role_deletion_status(**kwargs)

  

  Retrieves the status of your service-linked role deletion. After you use `DeleteServiceLinkedRole <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteServiceLinkedRole.html>`__ to submit a service-linked role for deletion, you can use the ``DeletionTaskId`` parameter in ``GetServiceLinkedRoleDeletionStatus`` to check the status of the deletion. If the deletion fails, this operation returns the reason that it failed, if that information is returned by the service.
