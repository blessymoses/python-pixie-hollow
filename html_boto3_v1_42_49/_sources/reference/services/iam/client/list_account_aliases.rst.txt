.. py:method:: IAM.Client.list_account_aliases(**kwargs)

  

  Lists the account alias associated with the Amazon Web Services account (Note: you can have only one). For information about using an Amazon Web Services account alias, see `Creating, deleting, and listing an Amazon Web Services account alias <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/console_account-alias.html#CreateAccountAlias>`__ in the *IAM User Guide*.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_account_aliases(
        Marker='string',
        MaxItems=123
    )
    
  :type Marker: string
  :param Marker: 

    Use this parameter only when paginating results and only after you receive a response indicating that the results are truncated. Set it to the value of the ``Marker`` element in the response that you received to indicate where the next call should start.

    

  
  :type MaxItems: integer
  :param MaxItems: 

    Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum number of items you want in the response. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the ``IsTruncated`` response element is ``true``.

     

    If you do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more results available. In that case, the ``IsTruncated`` response element returns ``true``, and ``Marker`` contains a value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.

    **Response Syntax**

    
    ::

      {
          'AccountAliases': [
              'string',
          ],
          'IsTruncated': True|False,
          'Marker': 'string'
      }
      
    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 

      Contains the response to a successful `ListAccountAliases <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_ListAccountAliases.html>`__ request.

      
      

      - **AccountAliases** *(list) --* 

        A list of aliases associated with the account. Amazon Web Services supports only one alias per account.

        
        

        - *(string) --* 
    
      

      - **IsTruncated** *(boolean) --* 

        A flag that indicates whether there are more items to return. If your results were truncated, you can make a subsequent pagination request using the ``Marker`` request parameter to retrieve more items. Note that IAM might return fewer than the ``MaxItems`` number of results even when there are more results available. We recommend that you check ``IsTruncated`` after every call to ensure that you receive all your results.

        
      

      - **Marker** *(string) --* 

        When ``IsTruncated`` is ``true``, this element is present and contains the value to use for the ``Marker`` parameter in a subsequent pagination request.

        
  
  **Exceptions**
  
  *   :py:class:`IAM.Client.exceptions.ServiceFailureException`

  

  **Examples**

  The following command lists the aliases for the current account.
