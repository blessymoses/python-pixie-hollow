.. py:method:: IAM.Client.get_policy(**kwargs)

  

  Retrieves information about the specified managed policy, including the policy's default version and the total number of IAM users, groups, and roles to which the policy is attached. To retrieve the list of the specific users, groups, and roles that the policy is attached to, use `ListEntitiesForPolicy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_ListEntitiesForPolicy.html>`__. This operation returns metadata about the policy. To retrieve the actual policy document for a specific version of the policy, use `GetPolicyVersion <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_GetPolicyVersion.html>`__.

   

  This operation retrieves information about managed policies. To retrieve information about an inline policy that is embedded with an IAM user, group, or role, use `GetUserPolicy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_GetUserPolicy.html>`__, `GetGroupPolicy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_GetGroupPolicy.html>`__, or `GetRolePolicy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_GetRolePolicy.html>`__.

   

  For more information about policies, see `Managed policies and inline policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide*.
