.. py:method:: IAM.Client.tag_role(**kwargs)

  

  Adds one or more tags to an IAM role. The role can be a regular role or a service-linked role. If a tag with the same key name already exists, then that tag is overwritten with the new value.

   

  A tag consists of a key name and an associated value. By assigning tags to your resources, you can do the following:

   

  
  * **Administrative grouping and discovery** - Attach tags to resources to aid in organization and search. For example, you could search for all resources with the key name *Project* and the value *MyImportantProject*. Or search for all resources with the key name *Cost Center* and the value *41200*.
   
  * **Access control** - Include tags in IAM user-based and resource-based policies. You can use tags to restrict access to only an IAM role that has a specified tag attached. You can also restrict access to only those resources that have a certain tag attached. For examples of policies that show how to use tags to control access, see `Control access using IAM tags <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_tags.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide*.
   
  * **Cost allocation** - Use tags to help track which individuals and teams are using which Amazon Web Services resources.
  

   

  .. note::

    

    
    * If any one of the tags is invalid or if you exceed the allowed maximum number of tags, then the entire request fails and the resource is not created. For more information about tagging, see `Tagging IAM resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide*.
     
    * Amazon Web Services always interprets the tag ``Value`` as a single string. If you need to store an array, you can store comma-separated values in the string. However, you must interpret the value in your code.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.tag_role(
        RoleName='string',
        Tags=[
            {
                'Key': 'string',
                'Value': 'string'
            },
        ]
    )
    
  :type RoleName: string
  :param RoleName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of the IAM role to which you want to add tags.

     

    This parameter accepts (through its `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__) a string of characters that consist of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: _+=,.@-

    

  
  :type Tags: list
  :param Tags: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The list of tags that you want to attach to the IAM role. Each tag consists of a key name and an associated value.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      A structure that represents user-provided metadata that can be associated with an IAM resource. For more information about tagging, see `Tagging IAM resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide*.

      

    
      - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The key name that can be used to look up or retrieve the associated value. For example, ``Department`` or ``Cost Center`` are common choices.

        

      
      - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The value associated with this tag. For example, tags with a key name of ``Department`` could have values such as ``Human Resources``, ``Accounting``, and ``Support``. Tags with a key name of ``Cost Center`` might have values that consist of the number associated with the different cost centers in your company. Typically, many resources have tags with the same key name but with different values.

        

      
    

  
  :returns: None
  **Exceptions**
  
  *   :py:class:`IAM.Client.exceptions.NoSuchEntityException`

  
  *   :py:class:`IAM.Client.exceptions.LimitExceededException`

  
  *   :py:class:`IAM.Client.exceptions.InvalidInputException`

  
  *   :py:class:`IAM.Client.exceptions.ConcurrentModificationException`

  **Examples**

  The following example shows how to add tags to an existing role.
  ::

    response = client.tag_role(
        RoleName='taggedrole',
        Tags=[
            {
                'Key': 'Dept',
                'Value': 'Accounting',
            },
            {
                'Key': 'CostCenter',
                'Value': '12345',
            },
        ],
    )
    
    print(response)

  
  Expected Output:
  ::

    {
        'ResponseMetadata': {
            '...': '...',
        },
    }
