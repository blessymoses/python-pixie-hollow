.. py:method:: IAM.Client.get_user_policy(**kwargs)

  

  Retrieves the specified inline policy document that is embedded in the specified IAM user.

   

  .. note::

    

    Policies returned by this operation are URL-encoded compliant with `RFC 3986 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986>`__. You can use a URL decoding method to convert the policy back to plain JSON text. For example, if you use Java, you can use the ``decode`` method of the ``java.net.URLDecoder`` utility class in the Java SDK. Other languages and SDKs provide similar functionality, and some SDKs do this decoding automatically.

    

   

  An IAM user can also have managed policies attached to it. To retrieve a managed policy document that is attached to a user, use `GetPolicy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_GetPolicy.html>`__ to determine the policy's default version. Then use `GetPolicyVersion <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_GetPolicyVersion.html>`__ to retrieve the policy document.

   

  For more information about policies, see `Managed policies and inline policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide*.

      Contains the response to a successful `GetUserPolicy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_GetUserPolicy.html>`__ request.

      
      

      - **UserName** *(string) --* 

        The user the policy is associated with.

        IAM stores policies in JSON format. However, resources that were created using CloudFormation templates can be formatted in YAML. CloudFormation always converts a YAML policy to JSON format before submitting it to IAM.
