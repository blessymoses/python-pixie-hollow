.. py:method:: IAM.Client.list_ssh_public_keys(**kwargs)

  

  Returns information about the SSH public keys associated with the specified IAM user. If none exists, the operation returns an empty list.

   

  The SSH public keys returned by this operation are used only for authenticating the IAM user to an CodeCommit repository. For more information about using SSH keys to authenticate to an CodeCommit repository, see `Set up CodeCommit for SSH connections <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/setting-up-credentials-ssh.html>`__ in the *CodeCommit User Guide*.

   

  Although each user is limited to a small number of keys, you can still paginate the results using the ``MaxItems`` and ``Marker`` parameters.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_ssh_public_keys(
        UserName='string',
        Marker='string',
        MaxItems=123
    )
    
  :type UserName: string
  :param UserName: 

    The name of the IAM user to list SSH public keys for. If none is specified, the ``UserName`` field is determined implicitly based on the Amazon Web Services access key used to sign the request.

     

    This parameter allows (through its `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__) a string of characters consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: _+=,.@-

    

  
  :type Marker: string
  :param Marker: 

    Use this parameter only when paginating results and only after you receive a response indicating that the results are truncated. Set it to the value of the ``Marker`` element in the response that you received to indicate where the next call should start.

    

  
  :type MaxItems: integer
  :param MaxItems: 

    Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum number of items you want in the response. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the ``IsTruncated`` response element is ``true``.

     

    If you do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more results available. In that case, the ``IsTruncated`` response element returns ``true``, and ``Marker`` contains a value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.

    **Response Syntax**

    
    ::

      {
          'SSHPublicKeys': [
              {
                  'UserName': 'string',
                  'SSHPublicKeyId': 'string',
                  'Status': 'Active'|'Inactive'|'Expired',
                  'UploadDate': datetime(2015, 1, 1)

      }
      
    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 

      Contains the response to a successful `ListSSHPublicKeys <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_ListSSHPublicKeys.html>`__ request.

      
      

      - **SSHPublicKeys** *(list) --* 

        A list of the SSH public keys assigned to IAM user.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          Contains information about an SSH public key, without the key's body or fingerprint.

           

          This data type is used as a response element in the `ListSSHPublicKeys <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_ListSSHPublicKeys.html>`__ operation.

          
          

          - **UserName** *(string) --* 

            The name of the IAM user associated with the SSH public key.

            
          

          - **SSHPublicKeyId** *(string) --* 

            The unique identifier for the SSH public key.

            
          

          - **Status** *(string) --* 

            The status of the SSH public key. ``Active`` means that the key can be used for authentication with an CodeCommit repository. ``Inactive`` means that the key cannot be used.

            
          

          - **UploadDate** *(datetime) --* 

            The date and time, in `ISO 8601 date-time format <http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601>`__, when the SSH public key was uploaded.

            
      
    
      

      - **IsTruncated** *(boolean) --* 

        A flag that indicates whether there are more items to return. If your results were truncated, you can make a subsequent pagination request using the ``Marker`` request parameter to retrieve more items. Note that IAM might return fewer than the ``MaxItems`` number of results even when there are more results available. We recommend that you check ``IsTruncated`` after every call to ensure that you receive all your results.

        
      

      - **Marker** *(string) --* 

        When ``IsTruncated`` is ``true``, this element is present and contains the value to use for the ``Marker`` parameter in a subsequent pagination request.
