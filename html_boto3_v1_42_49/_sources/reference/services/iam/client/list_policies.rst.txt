.. py:method:: IAM.Client.list_policies(**kwargs)

  

  Lists all the managed policies that are available in your Amazon Web Services account, including your own customer-defined managed policies and all Amazon Web Services managed policies.

   

  You can filter the list of policies that is returned using the optional ``OnlyAttached``, ``Scope``, and ``PathPrefix`` parameters. For example, to list only the customer managed policies in your Amazon Web Services account, set ``Scope`` to ``Local``. To list only Amazon Web Services managed policies, set ``Scope`` to ``AWS``.

   

  You can paginate the results using the ``MaxItems`` and ``Marker`` parameters.

   

  For more information about managed policies, see `Managed policies and inline policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide*.

   

  .. note::

    

    IAM resource-listing operations return a subset of the available attributes for the resource. For example, this operation does not return tags, even though they are an attribute of the returned object. To view all of the information for a customer manged policy, see `GetPolicy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_GetPolicy.html>`__.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_policies(
        Scope='All'|'AWS'|'Local',
        OnlyAttached=True|False,
        PathPrefix='string',
        PolicyUsageFilter='PermissionsPolicy'|'PermissionsBoundary',
        Marker='string',
        MaxItems=123
    )
    
  :type Scope: string
  :param Scope: 

    The scope to use for filtering the results.

     

    To list only Amazon Web Services managed policies, set ``Scope`` to ``AWS``. To list only the customer managed policies in your Amazon Web Services account, set ``Scope`` to ``Local``.

     

    This parameter is optional. If it is not included, or if it is set to ``All``, all policies are returned.

    

  
  :type OnlyAttached: boolean
  :param OnlyAttached: 

    A flag to filter the results to only the attached policies.

     

    When ``OnlyAttached`` is ``true``, the returned list contains only the policies that are attached to an IAM user, group, or role. When ``OnlyAttached`` is ``false``, or when the parameter is not included, all policies are returned.

    

  
  :type PathPrefix: string
  :param PathPrefix: 

    The path prefix for filtering the results. This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash (/), listing all policies. This parameter allows (through its `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__) a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it can contain any ASCII character from the ! ( ``\u0021``) through the DEL character ( ``\u007F``), including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters.

    

  
  :type PolicyUsageFilter: string
  :param PolicyUsageFilter: 

    The policy usage method to use for filtering the results.

     

    To list only permissions policies, set ``PolicyUsageFilter`` to ``PermissionsPolicy``. To list only the policies used to set permissions boundaries, set the value to ``PermissionsBoundary``.

     

    This parameter is optional. If it is not included, all policies are returned.

    

  
  :type Marker: string
  :param Marker: 

    Use this parameter only when paginating results and only after you receive a response indicating that the results are truncated. Set it to the value of the ``Marker`` element in the response that you received to indicate where the next call should start.

    

  
  :type MaxItems: integer
  :param MaxItems: 

    Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum number of items you want in the response. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the ``IsTruncated`` response element is ``true``.

     

    If you do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more results available. In that case, the ``IsTruncated`` response element returns ``true``, and ``Marker`` contains a value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.

              - **Value** *(string) --* 

                The value associated with this tag. For example, tags with a key name of ``Department`` could have values such as ``Human Resources``, ``Accounting``, and ``Support``. Tags with a key name of ``Cost Center`` might have values that consist of the number associated with the different cost centers in your company. Typically, many resources have tags with the same key name but with different values.

                
          
        
      
    
      

      - **IsTruncated** *(boolean) --* 

        A flag that indicates whether there are more items to return. If your results were truncated, you can make a subsequent pagination request using the ``Marker`` request parameter to retrieve more items. Note that IAM might return fewer than the ``MaxItems`` number of results even when there are more results available. We recommend that you check ``IsTruncated`` after every call to ensure that you receive all your results.

        
      

      - **Marker** *(string) --* 

        When ``IsTruncated`` is ``true``, this element is present and contains the value to use for the ``Marker`` parameter in a subsequent pagination request.
