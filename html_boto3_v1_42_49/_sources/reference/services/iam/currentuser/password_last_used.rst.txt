.. py:attribute:: IAM.CurrentUser.password_last_used

  

  - *(datetime) --* 

    The date and time, in `ISO 8601 date-time format <http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601>`__, when the user's password was last used to sign in to an Amazon Web Services website. For a list of Amazon Web Services websites that capture a user's last sign-in time, see the `Credential reports <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/credential-reports.html>`__ topic in the *IAM User Guide*. If a password is used more than once in a five-minute span, only the first use is returned in this field. If the field is null (no value), then it indicates that they never signed in with a password. This can be because:

     

    
    * The user never had a password.
     
    * A password exists but has not been used since IAM started tracking this information on October 20, 2014.
    

     

    A null value does not mean that the user *never* had a password. Also, if the user does not currently have a password but had one in the past, then this field contains the date and time the most recent password was used.

     

    This value is returned only in the `GetUser <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_GetUser.html>`__ and `ListUsers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_ListUsers.html>`__ operations.
