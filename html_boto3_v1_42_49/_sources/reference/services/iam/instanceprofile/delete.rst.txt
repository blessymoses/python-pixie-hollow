.. py:method:: IAM.InstanceProfile.delete()

  

  Deletes the specified instance profile. The instance profile must not have an associated role.

   

  .. warning::

     

    Make sure that you do not have any Amazon EC2 instances running with the instance profile you are about to delete. Deleting a role or instance profile that is associated with a running instance will break any applications running on the instance.

     

   

  For more information about instance profiles, see `Using instance profiles <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2_instance-profiles.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide*.
