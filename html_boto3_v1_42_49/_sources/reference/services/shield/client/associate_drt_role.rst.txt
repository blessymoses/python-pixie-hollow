.. py:method:: Shield.Client.associate_drt_role(**kwargs)

  

  Authorizes the Shield Response Team (SRT) using the specified role, to access your Amazon Web Services account to assist with DDoS attack mitigation during potential attacks. This enables the SRT to inspect your WAF configuration and create or update WAF rules and web ACLs.

   

  You can associate only one ``RoleArn`` with your subscription. If you submit an ``AssociateDRTRole`` request for an account that already has an associated role, the new ``RoleArn`` will replace the existing ``RoleArn``.

   

  Prior to making the ``AssociateDRTRole`` request, you must attach the ``AWSShieldDRTAccessPolicy`` managed policy to the role that you'll specify in the request. You can access this policy in the IAM console at `AWSShieldDRTAccessPolicy <https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSShieldDRTAccessPolicy>`__. For more information see `Adding and removing IAM identity permissions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_manage-attach-detach.html>`__. The role must also trust the service principal ``drt.shield.amazonaws.com``. For more information, see `IAM JSON policy elements\: Principal <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_principal.html>`__.

   

  The SRT will have access only to your WAF and Shield resources. By submitting this request, you authorize the SRT to inspect your WAF and Shield configuration and create and update WAF rules and web ACLs on your behalf. The SRT takes these actions only if explicitly authorized by you.

   

  You must have the ``iam:PassRole`` permission to make an ``AssociateDRTRole`` request. For more information, see `Granting a user permissions to pass a role to an Amazon Web Services service <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_passrole.html>`__.

   

  To use the services of the SRT and make an ``AssociateDRTRole`` request, you must be subscribed to the `Business Support plan <http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/business-support/>`__ or the `Enterprise Support plan <http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/enterprise-support/>`__.
