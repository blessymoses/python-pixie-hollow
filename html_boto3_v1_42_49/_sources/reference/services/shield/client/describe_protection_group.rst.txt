    response = client.describe_protection_group(
        ProtectionGroupId='string'
    )
    
  :type ProtectionGroupId: string
  :param ProtectionGroupId: **[REQUIRED]**

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **ProtectionGroup** *(dict) --* 

        A grouping of protected resources that you and Shield Advanced can monitor as a collective. This resource grouping improves the accuracy of detection and reduces false positives.

        
        

        - **ProtectionGroupId** *(string) --* 

          The name of the protection group. You use this to identify the protection group in lists and to manage the protection group, for example to update, delete, or describe it.

          
        

        - **Aggregation** *(string) --* 

          Defines how Shield combines resource data for the group in order to detect, mitigate, and report events.

           

          
          * Sum - Use the total traffic across the group. This is a good choice for most cases. Examples include Elastic IP addresses for EC2 instances that scale manually or automatically.
           
          * Mean - Use the average of the traffic across the group. This is a good choice for resources that share traffic uniformly. Examples include accelerators and load balancers.
           
          * Max - Use the highest traffic from each resource. This is useful for resources that don't share traffic and for resources that share that traffic in a non-uniform way. Examples include Amazon CloudFront distributions and origin resources for CloudFront distributions.
          

          
        

        - **Pattern** *(string) --* 

          The criteria to use to choose the protected resources for inclusion in the group. You can include all resources that have protections, provide a list of resource ARNs (Amazon Resource Names), or include all resources of a specified resource type.

          
        

        - **ResourceType** *(string) --* 

          The resource type to include in the protection group. All protected resources of this type are included in the protection group. You must set this when you set ``Pattern`` to ``BY_RESOURCE_TYPE`` and you must not set it for any other ``Pattern`` setting.

          
        

        - **Members** *(list) --* 

          The ARNs (Amazon Resource Names) of the resources to include in the protection group. You must set this when you set ``Pattern`` to ``ARBITRARY`` and you must not set it for any other ``Pattern`` setting.

          
          

          - *(string) --* 
      
        

        - **ProtectionGroupArn** *(string) --* 

          The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the protection group.
