.. py:class:: Pricing.Client

  A low-level client representing AWS Price List Service (Pricing)
  

  The Amazon Web Services Price List API is a centralized and convenient way to programmatically query Amazon Web Services for services, products, and pricing information. The Amazon Web Services Price List uses standardized product attributes such as ``Location``, ``Storage Class``, and ``Operating System``, and provides prices at the SKU level. You can use the Amazon Web Services Price List to do the following:

   

  
  * Build cost control and scenario planning tools
   
  * Reconcile billing data
   
  * Forecast future spend for budgeting purposes
   
  * Provide cost benefit analysis that compare your internal workloads with Amazon Web Services
  

   

  Use ``GetServices`` without a service code to retrieve the service codes for all Amazon Web Services services, then ``GetServices`` with a service code to retrieve the attribute names for that service. After you have the service code and attribute names, you can use ``GetAttributeValues`` to see what values are available for an attribute. With the service code and an attribute name and value, you can use ``GetProducts`` to find specific products that you're interested in, such as an ``AmazonEC2`` instance, with a ``Provisioned IOPS`` ``volumeType``.

   

  For more information, see `Using the Amazon Web Services Price List API <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/price-changes.html>`__ in the *Billing User Guide*.
