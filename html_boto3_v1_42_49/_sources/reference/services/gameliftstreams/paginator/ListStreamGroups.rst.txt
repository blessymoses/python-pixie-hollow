      A dictionary that provides parameters to control pagination.

      

    
      - **MaxItems** *(integer) --* 

        The total number of items to return. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified in max-items then a ``NextToken`` will be provided in the output that you can use to resume pagination.

        

      
      - **PageSize** *(integer) --* 

        The size of each page.

        

      
      - **StartingToken** *(string) --* 

        A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previous response.

              * ``ACTIVATING``: The stream group is deploying and isn't ready to host streams.

              * ``ACTIVE_WITH_ERRORS``: One or more locations in the stream group are in an error state. Verify the details of individual locations and remove any locations which are in error.
               
              * ``DELETING``: Amazon GameLift Streams is in the process of deleting the stream group.
               
              * ``ERROR``: An error occurred when the stream group deployed. See ``StatusReason`` (returned by ``CreateStreamGroup``, ``GetStreamGroup``, and ``UpdateStreamGroup``) for more information.
               
              * ``EXPIRED``: The stream group is expired and can no longer host streams. This typically occurs when a stream group is 365 days old, as indicated by the value of ``ExpiresAt``. Create a new stream group to resume streaming capabilities.
               
              * ``UPDATING_LOCATIONS``: One or more locations in the stream group are in the process of updating (either activating or deleting).
              

              
            

            - **CreatedAt** *(datetime) --* 

              A timestamp that indicates when this resource was created. Timestamps are expressed using in ISO8601 format, such as: ``2022-12-27T22:29:40+00:00`` (UTC).

              
            

            - **LastUpdatedAt** *(datetime) --* 

              A timestamp that indicates when this resource was last updated. Timestamps are expressed using in ISO8601 format, such as: ``2022-12-27T22:29:40+00:00`` (UTC).

              
            

            - **ExpiresAt** *(datetime) --* 

              The time at which this stream group expires. Timestamps are expressed using in ISO8601 format, such as: ``2022-12-27T22:29:40+00:00`` (UTC). After this time, you will no longer be able to update this stream group or use it to start stream sessions. Only Get and Delete operations will work on an expired stream group.
