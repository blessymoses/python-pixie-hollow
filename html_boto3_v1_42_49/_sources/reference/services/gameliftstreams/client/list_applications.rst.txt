    response = client.list_applications(
        NextToken='string',
        MaxResults=123
    )
    
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    The token that marks the start of the next set of results. Use this token when you retrieve results as sequential pages. To get the first page of results, omit a token value. To get the remaining pages, provide the token returned with the previous result set.

    

  
  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    The number of results to return. Use this parameter with ``NextToken`` to return results in sequential pages. Default value is ``25``.

          Describes an application resource that represents a collection of content for streaming with Amazon GameLift Streams. To retrieve additional application details, call `GetApplication <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/apireference/API_GetApplication.html>`__.

          
          

          - **Arn** *(string) --* 

            An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that's assigned to an application resource and uniquely identifies the application across all Amazon Web Services Regions. Format is ``arn:aws:gameliftstreams:[AWS Region]:[AWS account]:application/[resource ID]``.

            
          

          - **Id** *(string) --*
