.. py:method:: GameLiftStreams.Client.create_stream_group(**kwargs)

  

  Stream groups manage how Amazon GameLift Streams allocates resources and handles concurrent streams, allowing you to effectively manage capacity and costs. Within a stream group, you specify an application to stream, streaming locations and their capacity, and the stream class you want to use when streaming applications to your end-users. A stream class defines the hardware configuration of the compute resources that Amazon GameLift Streams will use when streaming, such as the CPU, GPU, and memory.

   

  Stream capacity represents the number of concurrent streams that can be active at a time. You set stream capacity per location, per stream group. The following capacity settings are available:

   

  
  * **Always-on capacity**: This setting, if non-zero, indicates minimum streaming capacity which is allocated to you and is never released back to the service. You pay for this base level of capacity at all times, whether used or idle.
   
  * **Maximum capacity**: This indicates the maximum capacity that the service can allocate for you. Newly created streams may take a few minutes to start. Capacity is released back to the service when idle. You pay for capacity that is allocated to you until it is released.
   
  * **Target-idle capacity**: This indicates idle capacity which the service pre-allocates and holds for you in anticipation of future activity. This helps to insulate your users from capacity-allocation delays. You pay for capacity which is held in this intentional idle state.
  

   

  Values for capacity must be whole number multiples of the tenancy value of the stream group's stream class.

   

  To adjust the capacity of any ``ACTIVE`` stream group, call `UpdateStreamGroup <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/apireference/API_UpdateStreamGroup.html>`__.

   

  If the ``CreateStreamGroup`` request is successful, Amazon GameLift Streams assigns a unique ID to the stream group resource and sets the status to ``ACTIVATING``. It can take a few minutes for Amazon GameLift Streams to finish creating the stream group while it searches for unallocated compute resources and provisions them. When complete, the stream group status will be ``ACTIVE`` and you can start stream sessions by using `StartStreamSession <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/apireference/API_StartStreamSession.html>`__. To check the stream group's status, call `GetStreamGroup <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/apireference/API_GetStreamGroup.html>`__.

   

  Stream groups should be recreated every 3-4 weeks to pick up important service updates and fixes. Stream groups that are older than 180 days can no longer be updated with new application associations. Stream groups expire when they are 365 days old, at which point they can no longer stream sessions. The exact expiration date is indicated by the date value in the ``ExpiresAt`` field.

  :type DefaultApplicationIdentifier: string
  :param DefaultApplicationIdentifier: 

    The unique identifier of the Amazon GameLift Streams application that you want to set as the default application in a stream group. The application that you specify must be in ``READY`` status. The default application is pre-cached on always-on compute resources, reducing stream startup times. Other applications are automatically cached as needed.

     

    If you do not link an application when you create a stream group, you will need to link one later, before you can start streaming, using `AssociateApplications <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/apireference/API_AssociateApplications.html>`__.

     

    This value is an `Amazon Resource Name (ARN) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference-arns.html>`__ or ID that uniquely identifies the application resource. Example ARN: ``arn:aws:gameliftstreams:us-west-2:111122223333:application/a-9ZY8X7Wv6``. Example ID: ``a-9ZY8X7Wv6``.

    

  
  :type LocationConfigurations: list
  :param LocationConfigurations: 

    A set of one or more locations and the streaming capacity for each location.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      Configuration settings that define a stream group's stream capacity for a location. When configuring a location for the first time, you must specify a numeric value for at least one of the two capacity types. To update the capacity for an existing stream group, call `UpdateStreamGroup <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/apireference/API_UpdateStreamGroup.html>`__. To add a new location and specify its capacity, call `AddStreamGroupLocations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/apireference/API_AddStreamGroupLocations.html>`__.

      

    
      - **LocationName** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        A location's name. For example, ``us-east-1``. For a complete list of locations that Amazon GameLift Streams supports, refer to `Regions, quotas, and limitations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/developerguide/regions-quotas.html>`__ in the *Amazon GameLift Streams Developer Guide*.

        

      
      - **AlwaysOnCapacity** *(integer) --* 

        This setting, if non-zero, indicates minimum streaming capacity which is allocated to you and is never released back to the service. You pay for this base level of capacity at all times, whether used or idle.

        

      
      - **OnDemandCapacity** *(integer) --* 

        This field is deprecated. Use ``MaximumCapacity`` instead. This parameter cannot be used with ``MaximumCapacity`` or ``TargetIdleCapacity`` in the same location configuration.

         

        The streaming capacity that Amazon GameLift Streams can allocate in response to stream requests, and then de-allocate when the session has terminated. This offers a cost control measure at the expense of a greater startup time (typically under 5 minutes). Default is 0 when creating a stream group or adding a location.

        

      
      - **TargetIdleCapacity** *(integer) --* 

        This indicates idle capacity which the service pre-allocates and holds for you in anticipation of future activity. This helps to insulate your users from capacity-allocation delays. You pay for capacity which is held in this intentional idle state.

        

      
      - **MaximumCapacity** *(integer) --* 

        This indicates the maximum capacity that the service can allocate for you. Newly created streams may take a few minutes to start. Capacity is released back to the service when idle. You pay for capacity that is allocated to you until it is released.

        

      
    

  :type Tags: dict
  :param Tags: 

    A list of labels to assign to the new stream group resource. Tags are developer-defined key-value pairs. Tagging Amazon Web Services resources is useful for resource management, access management and cost allocation. See `Tagging Amazon Web Services Resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*. You can use `TagResource <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/apireference/API_TagResource.html>`__ to add tags, `UntagResource <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/apireference/API_UntagResource.html>`__ to remove tags, and `ListTagsForResource <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/apireference/API_ListTagsForResource.html>`__ to view tags on existing resources.

          - **Status** *(string) --* 

            This value is set of locations, including their name, current status, and capacities.

             

            A location can be in one of the following states:

             

            
            * ``ACTIVATING``: Amazon GameLift Streams is preparing the location. You cannot stream from, scale the capacity of, or remove this location yet.
             
            * ``ACTIVE``: The location is provisioned with initial capacity. You can now stream from, scale the capacity of, or remove this location.
             
            * ``ERROR``: Amazon GameLift Streams failed to set up this location. The ``StatusReason`` field describes the error. You can remove this location and try to add it again.
             
            * ``REMOVING``: Amazon GameLift Streams is working to remove this location. This will release all provisioned capacity for this location in this stream group.
            

            
          

          - **AlwaysOnCapacity** *(integer) --* 

            This setting, if non-zero, indicates minimum streaming capacity which is allocated to you and is never released back to the service. You pay for this base level of capacity at all times, whether used or idle.

            
          

          - **OnDemandCapacity** *(integer) --* 

            The streaming capacity that Amazon GameLift Streams can allocate in response to stream requests, and then de-allocate when the session has terminated. This offers a cost control measure at the expense of a greater startup time (typically under 5 minutes). Default is 0 when creating a stream group or adding a location.

            
          

          - **TargetIdleCapacity** *(integer) --* 

            This indicates idle capacity which the service pre-allocates and holds for you in anticipation of future activity. This helps to insulate your users from capacity-allocation delays. You pay for capacity which is held in this intentional idle state.

            
          

          - **MaximumCapacity** *(integer) --* 

            This indicates the maximum capacity that the service can allocate for you. Newly created streams may take a few minutes to start. Capacity is released back to the service when idle. You pay for capacity that is allocated to you until it is released.

            
          

          - **RequestedCapacity** *(integer) --* 

            This value is the always-on capacity that you most recently requested for a stream group. You request capacity separately for each location in a stream group. In response to an increase in requested capacity, Amazon GameLift Streams attempts to provision compute resources to make the stream group's allocated capacity meet requested capacity. When always-on capacity is decreased, it can take a few minutes to deprovision allocated capacity to match the requested capacity.

            
          

          - **AllocatedCapacity** *(integer) --* 

            This value is the stream capacity that Amazon GameLift Streams has provisioned in a stream group that can respond immediately to stream requests. It includes resources that are currently streaming and resources that are idle and ready to respond to stream requests. When target-idle capacity is configured, the idle resources include the capacity buffer maintained beyond ongoing sessions. You pay for this capacity whether it's in use or not. After making changes to capacity, it can take a few minutes for the allocated capacity count to reflect the change while compute resources are allocated or deallocated. Similarly, when allocated on-demand capacity is no longer needed, it can take a few minutes for Amazon GameLift Streams to spin down the allocated capacity.

            
          

          - **IdleCapacity** *(integer) --* 

            This value is the amount of allocated capacity that is not currently streaming. It represents the stream group's ability to respond immediately to new stream requests with near-instant startup time.

            
      
    
      

      - **StreamClass** *(string) --* 

        The target stream quality for the stream group.

         

        A stream class can be one of the following:

      - **Id** *(string) --* 

        A unique ID value that is assigned to the resource when it's created. Format example: ``sg-1AB2C3De4``.

        
      

      - **Status** *(string) --* 

        The current status of the stream group resource. Possible statuses include the following:

         

        
        * ``ACTIVATING``: The stream group is deploying and isn't ready to host streams.
         
        * ``ACTIVE``: The stream group is ready to host streams.
         
        * ``ACTIVE_WITH_ERRORS``: One or more locations in the stream group are in an error state. Verify the details of individual locations and remove any locations which are in error.
         
        * ``DELETING``: Amazon GameLift Streams is in the process of deleting the stream group.
         
        * ``ERROR``: An error occurred when the stream group deployed. See ``StatusReason`` (returned by ``CreateStreamGroup``, ``GetStreamGroup``, and ``UpdateStreamGroup``) for more information.
         
        * ``EXPIRED``: The stream group is expired and can no longer host streams. This typically occurs when a stream group is 365 days old, as indicated by the value of ``ExpiresAt``. Create a new stream group to resume streaming capabilities.
         
        * ``UPDATING_LOCATIONS``: One or more locations in the stream group are in the process of updating (either activating or deleting).
        

        
      

      - **StatusReason** *(string) --* 

        A short description of the reason that the stream group is in ``ERROR`` status. The possible reasons can be one of the following:

         

        
        * ``internalError``: The request can't process right now because of an issue with the server. Try again later.
         
        * ``noAvailableInstances``: Amazon GameLift Streams does not currently have enough available capacity to fulfill your request. Wait a few minutes and retry the request as capacity can shift frequently. You can also try to make the request using a different stream class or in another region.
        

        
      

      - **LastUpdatedAt** *(datetime) --* 

        A timestamp that indicates when this resource was last updated. Timestamps are expressed using in ISO8601 format, such as: ``2022-12-27T22:29:40+00:00`` (UTC).

        
      

      - **CreatedAt** *(datetime) --* 

        A timestamp that indicates when this resource was created. Timestamps are expressed using in ISO8601 format, such as: ``2022-12-27T22:29:40+00:00`` (UTC).

        
      

      - **ExpiresAt** *(datetime) --* 

        The time at which this stream group expires. Timestamps are expressed using in ISO8601 format, such as: ``2022-12-27T22:29:40+00:00`` (UTC). After this time, you will no longer be able to update this stream group or use it to start stream sessions. Only Get and Delete operations will work on an expired stream group.

        
      

      - **AssociatedApplications** *(list) --* 

        A set of applications that this stream group is associated to. You can stream any of these applications by using this stream group.

         

        This value is a set of `Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference-arns.html>`__ that uniquely identify application resources. Example ARN: ``arn:aws:gameliftstreams:us-west-2:111122223333:application/a-9ZY8X7Wv6``.
