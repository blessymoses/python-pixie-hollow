.. py:method:: GameLiftStreams.Client.create_application(**kwargs)

  

  Creates an application resource in Amazon GameLift Streams, which specifies the application content you want to stream, such as a game build or other software, and configures the settings to run it.

   

  Before you create an application, upload your application content files to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket. For more information, see **Getting Started** in the Amazon GameLift Streams Developer Guide.

   

  .. warning::

     

    Make sure that your files in the Amazon S3 bucket are the correct version you want to use. If you change the files at a later time, you will need to create a new Amazon GameLift Streams application.

     

   

  If the request is successful, Amazon GameLift Streams begins to create an application and sets the status to ``INITIALIZED``. When an application reaches ``READY`` status, you can use the application to set up stream groups and start streams. To track application status, call `GetApplication <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/apireference/API_GetApplication.html>`__.

        ClientToken='string'
    )
    
  :type Description: string
  :param Description: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A human-readable label for the application. You can update this value later.

    

  
  :type RuntimeEnvironment: dict
  :param RuntimeEnvironment: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Configuration settings that identify the operating system for an application resource. This can also include a compatibility layer and other drivers.

     

    A runtime environment can be one of the following:

     

    
    * For Linux applications 

      
      * Ubuntu 22.04 LTS ( ``Type=UBUNTU, Version=22_04_LTS``)
      

    
     
    * For Windows applications 

      
      * Microsoft Windows Server 2022 Base ( ``Type=WINDOWS, Version=2022``)
       
      * Proton 9.0-2 ( ``Type=PROTON, Version=20250516``)
       
      * Proton 8.0-5 ( ``Type=PROTON, Version=20241007``)
       
      * Proton 8.0-2c ( ``Type=PROTON, Version=20230704``)
      

    
    

    

  
    - **Type** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The operating system and other drivers. For Proton, this also includes the Proton compatibility layer.

      

    
    - **Version** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      Versioned container environment for the application operating system.

      

    
  
  :type ExecutablePath: string
  :param ExecutablePath: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The relative path and file name of the executable file that Amazon GameLift Streams will stream. Specify a path relative to the location set in ``ApplicationSourceUri``. The file must be contained within the application's root folder. For Windows applications, the file must be a valid Windows executable or batch file with a filename ending in .exe, .cmd, or .bat. For Linux applications, the file must be a valid Linux binary executable or a script that contains an initial interpreter line starting with a shebang (' ``#!``').

    

  
  :type ApplicationSourceUri: string
  :param ApplicationSourceUri: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The location of the content that you want to stream. Enter an Amazon S3 URI to a bucket that contains your game or other application. The location can have a multi-level prefix structure, but it must include all the files needed to run the content. Amazon GameLift Streams copies everything under the specified location.

     

    This value is immutable. To designate a different content location, create a new application.

     

    .. note::

      

      The Amazon S3 bucket and the Amazon GameLift Streams application must be in the same Amazon Web Services Region.

      

    

  
  :type ApplicationLogPaths: list
  :param ApplicationLogPaths: 

    Locations of log files that your content generates during a stream session. Enter path values that are relative to the ``ApplicationSourceUri`` location. You can specify up to 10 log paths. Amazon GameLift Streams uploads designated log files to the Amazon S3 bucket that you specify in ``ApplicationLogOutputUri`` at the end of a stream session. To retrieve stored log files, call `GetStreamSession <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/apireference/API_GetStreamSession.html>`__ and get the ``LogFileLocationUri``.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type ApplicationLogOutputUri: string
  :param ApplicationLogOutputUri: 

    An Amazon S3 URI to a bucket where you would like Amazon GameLift Streams to save application logs. Required if you specify one or more ``ApplicationLogPaths``.

     

    .. note::

      

      The log bucket must have permissions that give Amazon GameLift Streams access to write the log files. For more information, see `Application log bucket permission policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/developerguide/applications.html#application-bucket-permission-template>`__ in the *Amazon GameLift Streams Developer Guide*.

      

    

  
  :type Tags: dict
  :param Tags: 

    A list of labels to assign to the new application resource. Tags are developer-defined key-value pairs. Tagging Amazon Web Services resources is useful for resource management, access management and cost allocation. See `Tagging Amazon Web Services Resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*. You can use `TagResource <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/apireference/API_TagResource.html>`__ to add tags, `UntagResource <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/apireference/API_UntagResource.html>`__ to remove tags, and `ListTagsForResource <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/apireference/API_ListTagsForResource.html>`__ to view tags on existing resources.

  :type ClientToken: string
  :param ClientToken: 

    A unique identifier that represents a client request. The request is idempotent, which ensures that an API request completes only once. When users send a request, Amazon GameLift Streams automatically populates this field.

    This field is autopopulated if not provided.
