.. py:method:: GameLiftStreams.Client.start_stream_session(**kwargs)

  

  This action initiates a new stream session and outputs connection information that clients can use to access the stream. A stream session refers to an instance of a stream that Amazon GameLift Streams transmits from the server to the end-user. A stream session runs on a compute resource that a stream group has allocated. The start stream session process works as follows:

   

   
  * Prerequisites: 

    
    * You must have a stream group in ``ACTIVE`` status
     
    * You must have idle or on-demand capacity in a stream group in the location you want to stream from
     
    * You must have at least one application associated to the stream group (use `AssociateApplications <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/apireference/API_AssociateApplications.html>`__ if needed)
    

  
   
  * Start stream request: 

    
    * Your backend server calls **StartStreamSession** to initiate connection
     
    * Amazon GameLift Streams creates the stream session resource, assigns an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) value, and begins searching for available stream capacity to run the stream
     
    * Session transitions to ``ACTIVATING`` status
    

  
   
  * Placement completion: 

    
    * If Amazon GameLift Streams is successful in finding capacity for the stream, the stream session status changes to ``ACTIVE`` status and **StartStreamSession** returns stream connection information
     
    * If Amazon GameLift Streams was not successful in finding capacity within the placement timeout period (defined according to the capacity type and platform type), the stream session status changes to ``ERROR`` status and **StartStreamSession** returns a ``StatusReason`` of ``placementTimeout``
    

  
   
  * Connection completion: 

    
    * Provide the new connection information to the requesting client
     
    * Client must establish connection within ``ConnectionTimeoutSeconds`` (specified in **StartStreamSession** parameters)
     
    * Session terminates automatically if client fails to connect in time
    

  
   

   

  For more information about the stream session lifecycle, see `Stream sessions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/developerguide/stream-sessions.html>`__ in the *Amazon GameLift Streams Developer Guide*.

   

  Timeouts to be aware of that affect a stream session:

   

  
  * **Placement timeout**: The amount of time that Amazon GameLift Streams has to find capacity for a stream request. Placement timeout varies based on the capacity type used to fulfill your stream request: 

    
    * **Always-on capacity**: 75 seconds
     
    * **On-demand capacity**: 

      
      * Linux/Proton runtimes: 90 seconds
       
      * Windows runtime: 10 minutes
      

    
    

  
   
  * **Connection timeout**: The amount of time that Amazon GameLift Streams waits for a client to connect to a stream session in ``ACTIVE`` status, or reconnect to a stream session in ``PENDING_CLIENT_RECONNECTION`` status, the latter of which occurs when a client disconnects or loses connection from a stream session. If no client connects before the timeout, Amazon GameLift Streams terminates the stream session. This value is specified by ``ConnectionTimeoutSeconds`` in the ``StartStreamSession`` parameters.
   
  * **Idle timeout**: A stream session will be terminated if no user input has been received for 60 minutes.
   
  * **Maximum session length**: A stream session will be terminated after this amount of time has elapsed since it started, regardless of any existing client connections. This value is specified by ``SessionLengthSeconds`` in the ``StartStreamSession`` parameters.
  

   

  To start a new stream session, specify a stream group ID and application ID, along with the transport protocol and signal request to use with the stream session.

   

  For stream groups that have multiple locations, provide a set of locations ordered by priority using a ``Locations`` parameter. Amazon GameLift Streams will start a single stream session in the next available location. An application must be finished replicating to a remote location before the remote location can host a stream.

   

  To reconnect to a stream session after a client disconnects or loses connection, use `CreateStreamSessionConnection <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/apireference/API_CreateStreamSessionConnection.html>`__.

        }
    )
    
  :type ClientToken: string
  :param ClientToken: 

    A unique identifier that represents a client request. The request is idempotent, which ensures that an API request completes only once. When users send a request, Amazon GameLift Streams automatically populates this field.

    This field is autopopulated if not provided.

  
  :type Description: string
  :param Description: 

    A human-readable label for the stream session. You can update this value later.

    

  
  :type Identifier: string
  :param Identifier: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The stream group to run this stream session with.

     

    This value is an `Amazon Resource Name (ARN) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference-arns.html>`__ or ID that uniquely identifies the stream group resource. Example ARN: ``arn:aws:gameliftstreams:us-west-2:111122223333:streamgroup/sg-1AB2C3De4``. Example ID: ``sg-1AB2C3De4``.

    The data transport protocol to use for the stream session.

    

  
  :type SignalRequest: string
  :param SignalRequest: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A WebRTC ICE offer string to use when initializing a WebRTC connection. Typically, the offer is a very long JSON string. Provide the string as a text value in quotes.

     

    Amazon GameLift Streams also supports setting the field to "NO_CLIENT_CONNECTION". This will create a session without needing any browser request or Web SDK integration. The session starts up as usual and waits for a reconnection from a browser, which is accomplished using `CreateStreamSessionConnection <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/apireference/API_CreateStreamSessionConnection.html>`__.

    

  
  :type ApplicationIdentifier: string
  :param ApplicationIdentifier: **[REQUIRED]** 

    An `Amazon Resource Name (ARN) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference-arns.html>`__ or ID that uniquely identifies the application resource. Example ARN: ``arn:aws:gameliftstreams:us-west-2:111122223333:application/a-9ZY8X7Wv6``. Example ID: ``a-9ZY8X7Wv6``.

    

  
  :type UserId: string

  :type ConnectionTimeoutSeconds: integer
  :param ConnectionTimeoutSeconds: 

    Length of time (in seconds) that Amazon GameLift Streams should wait for a client to connect or reconnect to the stream session. Applies to both connection and reconnection scenarios. This time span starts when the stream session reaches ``ACTIVE`` state. If no client connects before the timeout, Amazon GameLift Streams terminates the stream session. Default value is 120.

    

  
  :type SessionLengthSeconds: integer
  :param SessionLengthSeconds: 

    The maximum duration of a session. Amazon GameLift Streams will automatically terminate a session after this amount of time has elapsed, regardless of any existing client connections. Default value is 43200 (12 hours).

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **Arn** *(string) --* 

        The `Amazon Resource Name (ARN) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference-arns.html>`__ that's assigned to a stream session resource. When combined with the stream group resource ID, this value uniquely identifies the stream session across all Amazon Web Services Regions. Format is ``arn:aws:gameliftstreams:[AWS Region]:[AWS account]:streamsession/[stream group resource ID]/[stream session resource ID]``.

        
      

      - **Description** *(string) --* 

        A human-readable label for the stream session. You can update this value at any time.

        
      

      - **StreamGroupId** *(string) --* 

        The unique identifier for the Amazon GameLift Streams stream group that is hosting the stream session. Format example: ``sg-1AB2C3De4``.

        
      

      - **UserId** *(string) --* 

        An opaque, unique identifier for an end-user, defined by the developer.

        
      

      - **Status** *(string) --* 

        The current status of the stream session. A stream session is ready for a client to connect when in ``ACTIVE`` status.

         

        
        * ``ACTIVATING``: The stream session is starting and preparing to stream.
         
        * ``ACTIVE``: The stream session is ready and waiting for a client connection. A client has ``ConnectionTimeoutSeconds`` (specified in ``StartStreamSession``) from when the session reaches ``ACTIVE`` state to establish a connection. If no client connects within this timeframe, the session automatically terminates.
         
        * ``CONNECTED``: The stream session has a connected client. A session will automatically terminate if there is no user input for 60 minutes, or if the maximum length of a session specified by ``SessionLengthSeconds`` in ``StartStreamSession`` is exceeded.
         
        * ``ERROR``: The stream session failed to activate. See ``StatusReason`` (returned by ``GetStreamSession`` and ``StartStreamSession``) for more information.
         
        * ``PENDING_CLIENT_RECONNECTION``: A client has recently disconnected and the stream session is waiting for the client to reconnect. A client has ``ConnectionTimeoutSeconds`` (specified in ``StartStreamSession``) from when the session reaches ``PENDING_CLIENT_RECONNECTION`` state to re-establish a connection. If no client connects within this timeframe, the session automatically terminates.
         
        * ``RECONNECTING``: A client has initiated a reconnect to a session that was in ``PENDING_CLIENT_RECONNECTION`` state.
         
        * ``TERMINATING``: The stream session is ending.
         
        * ``TERMINATED``: The stream session has ended.
        

        
      

      - **StatusReason** *(string) --* 

        A short description of the reason the stream session is in ``ERROR`` status or ``TERMINATED`` status.

         

        ``ERROR`` status reasons:

         

        
        * ``applicationLogS3DestinationError``: Could not write the application log to the Amazon S3 bucket that is configured for the streaming application. Make sure the bucket still exists.
         
        * ``internalError``: An internal service error occurred. Start a new stream session to continue streaming.
         
        * ``invalidSignalRequest``: The WebRTC signal request that was sent is not valid. When starting or reconnecting to a stream session, use ``generateSignalRequest`` in the Amazon GameLift Streams Web SDK to generate a new signal request.
         
        * ``placementTimeout``: Amazon GameLift Streams could not find available stream capacity to start a stream session. Increase the stream capacity in the stream group or wait until capacity becomes available.
        

         

        ``TERMINATED`` status reasons:

         

        
        * ``apiTerminated``: The stream session was terminated by an API call to `TerminateStreamSession <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/apireference/API_TerminateStreamSession.html>`__.
         
        * ``applicationExit``: The streaming application exited or crashed. The stream session was terminated because the application is no longer running.
         
        * ``connectionTimeout``: The stream session was terminated because the client failed to connect within the connection timeout period specified by ``ConnectionTimeoutSeconds``.
         
        * ``idleTimeout``: The stream session was terminated because it exceeded the idle timeout period of 60 minutes with no user input activity.
         
        * ``maxSessionLengthTimeout``: The stream session was terminated because it exceeded the maximum session length timeout period specified by ``SessionLengthSeconds``.
         
        * ``reconnectionTimeout``: The stream session was terminated because the client failed to reconnect within the reconnection timeout period specified by ``ConnectionTimeoutSeconds`` after losing connection.
        

        
      

      - **Protocol** *(string) --*
