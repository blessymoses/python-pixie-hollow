.. py:method:: GameLiftStreams.Client.delete_application(**kwargs)

  

  Permanently deletes an Amazon GameLift Streams application resource. This also deletes the application content files stored with Amazon GameLift Streams. However, this does not delete the original files that you uploaded to your Amazon S3 bucket; you can delete these any time after Amazon GameLift Streams creates an application, which is the only time Amazon GameLift Streams accesses your Amazon S3 bucket.

   

  You can only delete an application that meets the following conditions:

   

  
  * The application is in ``READY`` or ``ERROR`` status. You cannot delete an application that's in ``PROCESSING`` or ``INITIALIZED`` status.
   
  * The application is not the default application of any stream groups. You must first delete the stream group by using `DeleteStreamGroup <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/apireference/API_DeleteStreamGroup.html>`__.
   
  * The application is not linked to any stream groups. You must first unlink the stream group by using `DisassociateApplications <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/apireference/API_DisassociateApplications.html>`__.
   
  * An application is not streaming in any ongoing stream session. You must wait until the client ends the stream session or call `TerminateStreamSession <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/apireference/API_TerminateStreamSession.html>`__ to end the stream.
  

   

  If any active stream groups exist for this application, this request returns a ``ValidationException``.
