    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **Arn** *(string) --* 

        The `Amazon Resource Name (ARN) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference-arns.html>`__ that's assigned to a stream session resource. When combined with the stream group resource ID, this value uniquely identifies the stream session across all Amazon Web Services Regions. Format is ``arn:aws:gameliftstreams:[AWS Region]:[AWS account]:streamsession/[stream group resource ID]/[stream session resource ID]``.

        
      

      - **Description** *(string) --* 

        A human-readable label for the stream session. You can update this value at any time.

        
      

      - **StreamGroupId** *(string) --* 

        The unique identifier for the Amazon GameLift Streams stream group that is hosting the stream session. Format example: ``sg-1AB2C3De4``.

        
      

      - **UserId** *(string) --* 

        An opaque, unique identifier for an end-user, defined by the developer.

        
      

      - **Status** *(string) --* 

        The current status of the stream session. A stream session is ready for a client to connect when in ``ACTIVE`` status.

         

        
        * ``ACTIVATING``: The stream session is starting and preparing to stream.
         
        * ``ACTIVE``: The stream session is ready and waiting for a client connection. A client has ``ConnectionTimeoutSeconds`` (specified in ``StartStreamSession``) from when the session reaches ``ACTIVE`` state to establish a connection. If no client connects within this timeframe, the session automatically terminates.
         
        * ``CONNECTED``: The stream session has a connected client. A session will automatically terminate if there is no user input for 60 minutes, or if the maximum length of a session specified by ``SessionLengthSeconds`` in ``StartStreamSession`` is exceeded.
         
        * ``ERROR``: The stream session failed to activate. See ``StatusReason`` (returned by ``GetStreamSession`` and ``StartStreamSession``) for more information.
         
        * ``PENDING_CLIENT_RECONNECTION``: A client has recently disconnected and the stream session is waiting for the client to reconnect. A client has ``ConnectionTimeoutSeconds`` (specified in ``StartStreamSession``) from when the session reaches ``PENDING_CLIENT_RECONNECTION`` state to re-establish a connection. If no client connects within this timeframe, the session automatically terminates.
         
        * ``RECONNECTING``: A client has initiated a reconnect to a session that was in ``PENDING_CLIENT_RECONNECTION`` state.
         
        * ``TERMINATING``: The stream session is ending.
         
        * ``TERMINATED``: The stream session has ended.
        

        
      

      - **StatusReason** *(string) --* 

        A short description of the reason the stream session is in ``ERROR`` status or ``TERMINATED`` status.

         

        ``ERROR`` status reasons:

         

        
        * ``applicationLogS3DestinationError``: Could not write the application log to the Amazon S3 bucket that is configured for the streaming application. Make sure the bucket still exists.
         
        * ``internalError``: An internal service error occurred. Start a new stream session to continue streaming.
         
        * ``invalidSignalRequest``: The WebRTC signal request that was sent is not valid. When starting or reconnecting to a stream session, use ``generateSignalRequest`` in the Amazon GameLift Streams Web SDK to generate a new signal request.
         
        * ``placementTimeout``: Amazon GameLift Streams could not find available stream capacity to start a stream session. Increase the stream capacity in the stream group or wait until capacity becomes available.
        

         

        ``TERMINATED`` status reasons:

         

        
        * ``apiTerminated``: The stream session was terminated by an API call to `TerminateStreamSession <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/apireference/API_TerminateStreamSession.html>`__.
         
        * ``applicationExit``: The streaming application exited or crashed. The stream session was terminated because the application is no longer running.
         
        * ``connectionTimeout``: The stream session was terminated because the client failed to connect within the connection timeout period specified by ``ConnectionTimeoutSeconds``.
         
        * ``idleTimeout``: The stream session was terminated because it exceeded the idle timeout period of 60 minutes with no user input activity.
         
        * ``maxSessionLengthTimeout``: The stream session was terminated because it exceeded the maximum session length timeout period specified by ``SessionLengthSeconds``.
         
        * ``reconnectionTimeout``: The stream session was terminated because the client failed to reconnect within the reconnection timeout period specified by ``ConnectionTimeoutSeconds`` after losing connection.
        

        
      

      - **Protocol** *(string) --* 

        The data transfer protocol in use with the stream session.

        
      

      - **Location** *(string) --* 

        The location where Amazon GameLift Streams hosts and streams your application. For example, ``us-east-1``. For a complete list of locations that Amazon GameLift Streams supports, refer to `Regions, quotas, and limitations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/developerguide/regions-quotas.html>`__ in the *Amazon GameLift Streams Developer Guide*.

        
      

      - **SignalRequest** *(string) --* 

        The WebRTC ICE offer string that a client generates to initiate a connection to the stream session.

        
      

      - **SignalResponse** *(string) --* 

        The WebRTC answer string that the stream server generates in response to the ``SignalRequest``.

        
      

      - **ConnectionTimeoutSeconds** *(integer) --* 

        The length of time that Amazon GameLift Streams should wait for a client to connect or reconnect to the stream session. This time span starts when the stream session reaches ``ACTIVE`` or ``PENDING_CLIENT_RECONNECTION`` state. If no client connects (or reconnects) before the timeout, Amazon GameLift Streams terminates the stream session.

        
      

      - **SessionLengthSeconds** *(integer) --* 

        The maximum duration of a session. Amazon GameLift Streams will automatically terminate a session after this amount of time has elapsed, regardless of any existing client connections.

        
      

      - **AdditionalLaunchArgs** *(list) --* 

        A list of CLI arguments that are sent to the streaming server when a stream session launches. You can use this to configure the application or stream session details. You can also provide custom arguments that Amazon GameLift Streams passes to your game client.

         

        ``AdditionalEnvironmentVariables`` and ``AdditionalLaunchArgs`` have similar purposes. ``AdditionalEnvironmentVariables`` passes data using environment variables; while ``AdditionalLaunchArgs`` passes data using command-line arguments.

        
        

        - *(string) --* 
    
      

      - **AdditionalEnvironmentVariables** *(dict) --* 

        A set of options that you can use to control the stream session runtime environment, expressed as a set of key-value pairs. You can use this to configure the application or stream session details. You can also provide custom environment variables that Amazon GameLift Streams passes to your game client.

         

        .. note::

          

          If you want to debug your application with environment variables, we recommend that you do so in a local environment outside of Amazon GameLift Streams. For more information, refer to the Compatibility Guidance in the troubleshooting section of the Developer Guide.

          

         

        ``AdditionalEnvironmentVariables`` and ``AdditionalLaunchArgs`` have similar purposes. ``AdditionalEnvironmentVariables`` passes data using environment variables; while ``AdditionalLaunchArgs`` passes data using command-line arguments.
