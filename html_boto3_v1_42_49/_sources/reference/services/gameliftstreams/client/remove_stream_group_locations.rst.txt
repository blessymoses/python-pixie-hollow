.. py:method:: GameLiftStreams.Client.remove_stream_group_locations(**kwargs)

  

  Removes a set of remote locations from this stream group. To remove a location, the stream group must be in ``ACTIVE`` status. When you remove a location, Amazon GameLift Streams releases allocated compute resources in that location. Stream sessions can no longer start from removed locations in a stream group. Amazon GameLift Streams also deletes the content files of all associated applications that were in Amazon GameLift Streams's internal Amazon S3 bucket at this location.

   

  You cannot remove the Amazon Web Services Region location where you initially created this stream group, known as the primary location. However, you can set the stream capacity to zero to avoid incurring costs for allocated compute resources in that location.
