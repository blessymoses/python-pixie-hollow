.. py:method:: GameLiftStreams.Client.update_stream_group(**kwargs)

  

  Updates the configuration settings for an Amazon GameLift Streams stream group resource. To update a stream group, it must be in ``ACTIVE`` status. You can change the description, the set of locations, and the requested capacity of a stream group per location. If you want to change the stream class, create a new stream group.

   

  Stream capacity represents the number of concurrent streams that can be active at a time. You set stream capacity per location, per stream group. The following capacity settings are available:

   

  
  * **Always-on capacity**: This setting, if non-zero, indicates minimum streaming capacity which is allocated to you and is never released back to the service. You pay for this base level of capacity at all times, whether used or idle.
   
  * **Maximum capacity**: This indicates the maximum capacity that the service can allocate for you. Newly created streams may take a few minutes to start. Capacity is released back to the service when idle. You pay for capacity that is allocated to you until it is released.
   
  * **Target-idle capacity**: This indicates idle capacity which the service pre-allocates and holds for you in anticipation of future activity. This helps to insulate your users from capacity-allocation delays. You pay for capacity which is held in this intentional idle state.
  

   

  Values for capacity must be whole number multiples of the tenancy value of the stream group's stream class.

   

  To update a stream group, specify the stream group's Amazon Resource Name (ARN) and provide the new values. If the request is successful, Amazon GameLift Streams returns the complete updated metadata for the stream group. Expired stream groups cannot be updated.

    )
    
  :type Identifier: string
  :param Identifier: **[REQUIRED]** 

    An `Amazon Resource Name (ARN) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference-arns.html>`__ or ID that uniquely identifies the stream group resource. Example ARN: ``arn:aws:gameliftstreams:us-west-2:111122223333:streamgroup/sg-1AB2C3De4``. Example ID: ``sg-1AB2C3De4``.

    

  
  :type LocationConfigurations: list
  :param LocationConfigurations: 

    A set of one or more locations and the streaming capacity for each location.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      Configuration settings that define a stream group's stream capacity for a location. When configuring a location for the first time, you must specify a numeric value for at least one of the two capacity types. To update the capacity for an existing stream group, call `UpdateStreamGroup <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/apireference/API_UpdateStreamGroup.html>`__. To add a new location and specify its capacity, call `AddStreamGroupLocations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/apireference/API_AddStreamGroupLocations.html>`__.

      

    
      - **LocationName** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        A location's name. For example, ``us-east-1``. For a complete list of locations that Amazon GameLift Streams supports, refer to `Regions, quotas, and limitations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/developerguide/regions-quotas.html>`__ in the *Amazon GameLift Streams Developer Guide*.

        

      
      - **AlwaysOnCapacity** *(integer) --* 

        This setting, if non-zero, indicates minimum streaming capacity which is allocated to you and is never released back to the service. You pay for this base level of capacity at all times, whether used or idle.

        

      
      - **OnDemandCapacity** *(integer) --* 

        This field is deprecated. Use ``MaximumCapacity`` instead. This parameter cannot be used with ``MaximumCapacity`` or ``TargetIdleCapacity`` in the same location configuration.

         

        The streaming capacity that Amazon GameLift Streams can allocate in response to stream requests, and then de-allocate when the session has terminated. This offers a cost control measure at the expense of a greater startup time (typically under 5 minutes). Default is 0 when creating a stream group or adding a location.

        

      
      - **TargetIdleCapacity** *(integer) --* 

        This indicates idle capacity which the service pre-allocates and holds for you in anticipation of future activity. This helps to insulate your users from capacity-allocation delays. You pay for capacity which is held in this intentional idle state.

        

      
      - **MaximumCapacity** *(integer) --* 

        This indicates the maximum capacity that the service can allocate for you. Newly created streams may take a few minutes to start. Capacity is released back to the service when idle. You pay for capacity that is allocated to you until it is released.

        

      
    

  :type Description: string
  :param Description: 

    A descriptive label for the stream group.

    

  
  :type DefaultApplicationIdentifier: string
  :param DefaultApplicationIdentifier: 

    The unique identifier of the Amazon GameLift Streams application that you want to set as the default application in a stream group. The application that you specify must be in ``READY`` status. The default application is pre-cached on always-on compute resources, reducing stream startup times. Other applications are automatically cached as needed.

     

    Note that this parameter only sets the default application in a stream group. To associate a new application to an existing stream group, you must use `AssociateApplications <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/apireference/API_AssociateApplications.html>`__.

     

    When you switch default applications in a stream group, it can take up to a few hours for the new default application to be pre-cached.

     

    This value is an `Amazon Resource Name (ARN) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference-arns.html>`__ or ID that uniquely identifies the application resource. Example ARN: ``arn:aws:gameliftstreams:us-west-2:111122223333:application/a-9ZY8X7Wv6``. Example ID: ``a-9ZY8X7Wv6``.

        - *(dict) --* 

          Represents a location and its corresponding stream capacity and status.

          
          

          - **LocationName** *(string) --* 

            A location's name. For example, ``us-east-1``. For a complete list of locations that Amazon GameLift Streams supports, refer to `Regions, quotas, and limitations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/developerguide/regions-quotas.html>`__ in the *Amazon GameLift Streams Developer Guide*.

            
          

          - **Status** *(string) --* 

            This value is set of locations, including their name, current status, and capacities.

             

            A location can be in one of the following states:

             

            
            * ``ACTIVATING``: Amazon GameLift Streams is preparing the location. You cannot stream from, scale the capacity of, or remove this location yet.
             
            * ``ACTIVE``: The location is provisioned with initial capacity. You can now stream from, scale the capacity of, or remove this location.
             
            * ``ERROR``: Amazon GameLift Streams failed to set up this location. The ``StatusReason`` field describes the error. You can remove this location and try to add it again.
             
            * ``REMOVING``: Amazon GameLift Streams is working to remove this location. This will release all provisioned capacity for this location in this stream group.
            

            
          

          - **AlwaysOnCapacity** *(integer) --* 

            This setting, if non-zero, indicates minimum streaming capacity which is allocated to you and is never released back to the service. You pay for this base level of capacity at all times, whether used or idle.

            
          

          - **OnDemandCapacity** *(integer) --* 

            The streaming capacity that Amazon GameLift Streams can allocate in response to stream requests, and then de-allocate when the session has terminated. This offers a cost control measure at the expense of a greater startup time (typically under 5 minutes). Default is 0 when creating a stream group or adding a location.

            
          

          - **TargetIdleCapacity** *(integer) --* 

            This indicates idle capacity which the service pre-allocates and holds for you in anticipation of future activity. This helps to insulate your users from capacity-allocation delays. You pay for capacity which is held in this intentional idle state.

            
          

          - **MaximumCapacity** *(integer) --* 

            This indicates the maximum capacity that the service can allocate for you. Newly created streams may take a few minutes to start. Capacity is released back to the service when idle. You pay for capacity that is allocated to you until it is released.

            
          

          - **RequestedCapacity** *(integer) --* 

            This value is the always-on capacity that you most recently requested for a stream group. You request capacity separately for each location in a stream group. In response to an increase in requested capacity, Amazon GameLift Streams attempts to provision compute resources to make the stream group's allocated capacity meet requested capacity. When always-on capacity is decreased, it can take a few minutes to deprovision allocated capacity to match the requested capacity.

            
          

          - **AllocatedCapacity** *(integer) --* 

            This value is the stream capacity that Amazon GameLift Streams has provisioned in a stream group that can respond immediately to stream requests. It includes resources that are currently streaming and resources that are idle and ready to respond to stream requests. When target-idle capacity is configured, the idle resources include the capacity buffer maintained beyond ongoing sessions. You pay for this capacity whether it's in use or not. After making changes to capacity, it can take a few minutes for the allocated capacity count to reflect the change while compute resources are allocated or deallocated. Similarly, when allocated on-demand capacity is no longer needed, it can take a few minutes for Amazon GameLift Streams to spin down the allocated capacity.

            
          

          - **IdleCapacity** *(integer) --* 

            This value is the amount of allocated capacity that is not currently streaming. It represents the stream group's ability to respond immediately to new stream requests with near-instant startup time.

            
      
    
      

      - **StreamClass** *(string) --* 

        The target stream quality for the stream group.

      - **Id** *(string) --* 

        A unique ID value that is assigned to the resource when it's created. Format example: ``sg-1AB2C3De4``.

        
      

      - **Status** *(string) --* 

        The current status of the stream group resource. Possible statuses include the following:

         

        
        * ``ACTIVATING``: The stream group is deploying and isn't ready to host streams.
         
        * ``ACTIVE``: The stream group is ready to host streams.
         
        * ``ACTIVE_WITH_ERRORS``: One or more locations in the stream group are in an error state. Verify the details of individual locations and remove any locations which are in error.
         
        * ``DELETING``: Amazon GameLift Streams is in the process of deleting the stream group.
         
        * ``ERROR``: An error occurred when the stream group deployed. See ``StatusReason`` (returned by ``CreateStreamGroup``, ``GetStreamGroup``, and ``UpdateStreamGroup``) for more information.
         
        * ``EXPIRED``: The stream group is expired and can no longer host streams. This typically occurs when a stream group is 365 days old, as indicated by the value of ``ExpiresAt``. Create a new stream group to resume streaming capabilities.
         
        * ``UPDATING_LOCATIONS``: One or more locations in the stream group are in the process of updating (either activating or deleting).
        

        
      

      - **StatusReason** *(string) --* 

        A short description of the reason that the stream group is in ``ERROR`` status. The possible reasons can be one of the following:

         

        
        * ``internalError``: The request can't process right now because of an issue with the server. Try again later.
         
        * ``noAvailableInstances``: Amazon GameLift Streams does not currently have enough available capacity to fulfill your request. Wait a few minutes and retry the request as capacity can shift frequently. You can also try to make the request using a different stream class or in another region.
        

        
      

      - **LastUpdatedAt** *(datetime) --* 

        A timestamp that indicates when this resource was last updated. Timestamps are expressed using in ISO8601 format, such as: ``2022-12-27T22:29:40+00:00`` (UTC).

        
      

      - **CreatedAt** *(datetime) --*

      - **ExpiresAt** *(datetime) --* 

        The time at which this stream group expires. Timestamps are expressed using in ISO8601 format, such as: ``2022-12-27T22:29:40+00:00`` (UTC). After this time, you will no longer be able to update this stream group or use it to start stream sessions. Only Get and Delete operations will work on an expired stream group.

        
      

      - **AssociatedApplications** *(list) --* 

        A set of applications that this stream group is associated with. You can stream any of these applications with the stream group.
