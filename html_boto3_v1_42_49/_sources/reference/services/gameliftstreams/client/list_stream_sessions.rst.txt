  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_stream_sessions(
        Status='ACTIVATING'|'ACTIVE'|'CONNECTED'|'PENDING_CLIENT_RECONNECTION'|'RECONNECTING'|'TERMINATING'|'TERMINATED'|'ERROR',
        ExportFilesStatus='SUCCEEDED'|'FAILED'|'PENDING',
        NextToken='string',
        MaxResults=123,
        Identifier='string'
    )
    
  :type Status: string
  :param Status: 

    Filter by the stream session status. You can specify one status in each request to retrieve only sessions that are currently in that status.

    

  
  :type ExportFilesStatus: string
  :param ExportFilesStatus: 

    Filter by the exported files status. You can specify one status in each request to retrieve only sessions that currently have that exported files status.

     

    Exported files can be in one of the following states:

     

    
    * ``SUCCEEDED``: The exported files are successfully stored in an S3 bucket.
     
    * ``FAILED``: The session ended but Amazon GameLift Streams couldn't collect and upload the files to S3.
     
    * ``PENDING``: Either the stream session is still in progress, or uploading the exported files to the S3 bucket is in progress.
    

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    The token that marks the start of the next set of results. Use this token when you retrieve results as sequential pages. To get the first page of results, omit a token value. To get the remaining pages, provide the token returned with the previous result set.

    

  
  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    The number of results to return. Use this parameter with ``NextToken`` to return results in sequential pages. Default value is ``25``.

    

  
  :type Identifier: string
  :param Identifier: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The unique identifier of a Amazon GameLift Streams stream group to retrieve the stream session for. You can use either the stream group ID or the `Amazon Resource Name (ARN) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference-arns.html>`__.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **Items** *(list) --* 

        A collection of Amazon GameLift Streams stream sessions that are associated with a stream group and returned in response to a list request. Each item includes stream session metadata and status.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          Describes an Amazon GameLift Streams stream session. To retrieve additional details for the stream session, call `GetStreamSession <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/apireference/API_GetStreamSession.html>`__.

          
          

          - **Arn** *(string) --* 

            An `Amazon Resource Name (ARN) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference-arns.html>`__ that uniquely identifies the stream session resource. Example ARN: ``arn:aws:gameliftstreams:us-west-2:111122223333:streamsession/sg-1AB2C3De4/ABC123def4567``.

            
          

          - **UserId** *(string) --* 

            An opaque, unique identifier for an end-user, defined by the developer.

            
          

          - **Status** *(string) --* 

            The current status of the stream session resource.

             

            
            * ``ACTIVATING``: The stream session is starting and preparing to stream.
             
            * ``ACTIVE``: The stream session is ready and waiting for a client connection. A client has ``ConnectionTimeoutSeconds`` (specified in ``StartStreamSession``) from when the session reaches ``ACTIVE`` state to establish a connection. If no client connects within this timeframe, the session automatically terminates.
             
            * ``CONNECTED``: The stream session has a connected client. A session will automatically terminate if there is no user input for 60 minutes, or if the maximum length of a session specified by ``SessionLengthSeconds`` in ``StartStreamSession`` is exceeded.
             
            * ``ERROR``: The stream session failed to activate. See ``StatusReason`` (returned by ``GetStreamSession`` and ``StartStreamSession``) for more information.
             
            * ``PENDING_CLIENT_RECONNECTION``: A client has recently disconnected and the stream session is waiting for the client to reconnect. A client has ``ConnectionTimeoutSeconds`` (specified in ``StartStreamSession``) from when the session reaches ``PENDING_CLIENT_RECONNECTION`` state to re-establish a connection. If no client connects within this timeframe, the session automatically terminates.
             
            * ``RECONNECTING``: A client has initiated a reconnect to a session that was in ``PENDING_CLIENT_RECONNECTION`` state.
             
            * ``TERMINATING``: The stream session is ending.
             
            * ``TERMINATED``: The stream session has ended.
            

            
          

          - **StatusReason** *(string) --* 

            A short description of the reason the stream session is in ``ERROR`` status or ``TERMINATED`` status.

             

            ``ERROR`` status reasons:

             

            
            * ``applicationLogS3DestinationError``: Could not write the application log to the Amazon S3 bucket that is configured for the streaming application. Make sure the bucket still exists.
             
            * ``internalError``: An internal service error occurred. Start a new stream session to continue streaming.
             
            * ``invalidSignalRequest``: The WebRTC signal request that was sent is not valid. When starting or reconnecting to a stream session, use ``generateSignalRequest`` in the Amazon GameLift Streams Web SDK to generate a new signal request.
             
            * ``placementTimeout``: Amazon GameLift Streams could not find available stream capacity to start a stream session. Increase the stream capacity in the stream group or wait until capacity becomes available.
            

             

            ``TERMINATED`` status reasons:

             

            
            * ``apiTerminated``: The stream session was terminated by an API call to `TerminateStreamSession <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/apireference/API_TerminateStreamSession.html>`__.
             
            * ``applicationExit``: The streaming application exited or crashed. The stream session was terminated because the application is no longer running.
             
            * ``connectionTimeout``: The stream session was terminated because the client failed to connect within the connection timeout period specified by ``ConnectionTimeoutSeconds``.
             
            * ``idleTimeout``: The stream session was terminated because it exceeded the idle timeout period of 60 minutes with no user input activity.
             
            * ``maxSessionLengthTimeout``: The stream session was terminated because it exceeded the maximum session length timeout period specified by ``SessionLengthSeconds``.
             
            * ``reconnectionTimeout``: The stream session was terminated because the client failed to reconnect within the reconnection timeout period specified by ``ConnectionTimeoutSeconds`` after losing connection.
            

            
          

          - **Protocol** *(string) --* 

            The data transfer protocol in use with the stream session.

            
          

          - **LastUpdatedAt** *(datetime) --* 

            A timestamp that indicates when this resource was last updated. Timestamps are expressed using in ISO8601 format, such as: ``2022-12-27T22:29:40+00:00`` (UTC).

            
          

          - **CreatedAt** *(datetime) --* 

            A timestamp that indicates when this resource was created. Timestamps are expressed using in ISO8601 format, such as: ``2022-12-27T22:29:40+00:00`` (UTC).

            
          

          - **ApplicationArn** *(string) --* 

            An `Amazon Resource Name (ARN) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference-arns.html>`__ that uniquely identifies the application resource. Example ARN: ``arn:aws:gameliftstreams:us-west-2:111122223333:application/a-9ZY8X7Wv6``.

            
          

          - **ExportFilesMetadata** *(dict) --* 

            Provides details about the stream session's exported files.

            
            

            - **Status** *(string) --* 

              The result of the `ExportStreamSessionFiles <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/apireference/API_ExportStreamSessionFiles.html>`__ operation.

              
            

            - **StatusReason** *(string) --* 

              A short description of the reason the export is in ``FAILED`` status.

              
            

            - **OutputUri** *(string) --* 

              The S3 bucket URI where Amazon GameLift Streams uploaded the set of compressed exported files for a stream session. Amazon GameLift Streams generates a ZIP file name based on the stream session metadata. Alternatively, you can provide a custom file name with a ``.zip`` file extension.

               

              Example 1: If you provide an S3 URI called ``s3://amzn-s3-demo-destination-bucket/MyGame_Session1.zip``, then Amazon GameLift Streams will save the files at that location.

               

              Example 2: If you provide an S3 URI called ``s3://amzn-s3-demo-destination-bucket/MyGameSessions_ExportedFiles/``, then Amazon GameLift Streams will save the files at ``s3://amzn-s3-demo-destination-bucket/MyGameSessions_ExportedFiles/YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-appId-sg-Id-sessionId.zip`` or another similar name.

              
        
          

          - **Location** *(string) --*
