.. py:method:: Detective.Client.list_graphs(**kwargs)

  

  Returns the list of behavior graphs that the calling account is an administrator account of. This operation can only be called by an administrator account.

   

  Because an account can currently only be the administrator of one behavior graph within a Region, the results always contain a single behavior graph.
