.. py:method:: GlobalAccelerator.Client.create_accelerator(**kwargs)

  

  Create an accelerator. An accelerator includes one or more listeners that process inbound connections and direct traffic to one or more endpoint groups, each of which includes endpoints, such as Network Load Balancers.

   

  .. warning::

     

    Global Accelerator is a global service that supports endpoints in multiple Amazon Web Services Regions but you must specify the US West (Oregon) Region to create, update, or otherwise work with accelerators. That is, for example, specify ``--region us-west-2`` on Amazon Web Services CLI commands.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.create_accelerator(
        Name='string',
        IpAddressType='IPV4'|'DUAL_STACK',
        IpAddresses=[
            'string',
        ],
        Enabled=True|False,
        IdempotencyToken='string',
        Tags=[
            {
                'Key': 'string',
                'Value': 'string'
            },
        ]
    )
    
  :type Name: string
  :param Name: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of the accelerator. The name can have a maximum of 64 characters, must contain only alphanumeric characters, periods (.), or hyphens (-), and must not begin or end with a hyphen or period.

    

  
  :type IpAddressType: string
  :param IpAddressType: 

    The IP address type that an accelerator supports. For a standard accelerator, the value can be IPV4 or DUAL_STACK.

    

  
  :type IpAddresses: list
  :param IpAddresses: 

    Optionally, if you've added your own IP address pool to Global Accelerator (BYOIP), you can choose an IPv4 address from your own pool to use for the accelerator's static IPv4 address when you create an accelerator.

     

    After you bring an address range to Amazon Web Services, it appears in your account as an address pool. When you create an accelerator, you can assign one IPv4 address from your range to it. Global Accelerator assigns you a second static IPv4 address from an Amazon IP address range. If you bring two IPv4 address ranges to Amazon Web Services, you can assign one IPv4 address from each range to your accelerator. This restriction is because Global Accelerator assigns each address range to a different network zone, for high availability.

     

    You can specify one or two addresses, separated by a space. Do not include the /32 suffix.

     

    Note that you can't update IP addresses for an existing accelerator. To change them, you must create a new accelerator with the new addresses.

     

    For more information, see `Bring your own IP addresses (BYOIP) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/using-byoip.html>`__ in the *Global Accelerator Developer Guide*.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type Enabled: boolean
  :param Enabled: 

    Indicates whether an accelerator is enabled. The value is true or false. The default value is true.

     

    If the value is set to true, an accelerator cannot be deleted. If set to false, the accelerator can be deleted.

    

  
  :type IdempotencyToken: string
  :param IdempotencyToken: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency—that is, the uniqueness—of an accelerator.

    This field is autopopulated if not provided.

  
  :type Tags: list
  :param Tags: 

    Create tags for an accelerator.

     

    For more information, see `Tagging in Global Accelerator <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/tagging-in-global-accelerator.html>`__ in the *Global Accelerator Developer Guide*.

          If you have a dual-stack accelerator, you also have a second DNS name, ``DualStackDnsName``, that points to both the A record and the AAAA record for all four static addresses for the accelerator: two IPv4 addresses and two IPv6 addresses.

           

          For more information about the default DNS name, see `Support for DNS addressing in Global Accelerator <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/dns-addressing-custom-domains.dns-addressing.html>`__ in the *Global Accelerator Developer Guide*.

          The Domain Name System (DNS) name that Global Accelerator creates that points to a dual-stack accelerator's four static IP addresses: two IPv4 addresses and two IPv6 addresses.

           

          The naming convention for the dual-stack DNS name is the following: A lowercase letter a, followed by a 16-bit random hex string, followed by .dualstack.awsglobalaccelerator.com. For example: a1234567890abcdef.dualstack.awsglobalaccelerator.com.

           

          Note: Global Accelerator also assigns a default DNS name, ``DnsName``, to your accelerator that points just to the static IPv4 addresses.

           

          For more information, see `Support for DNS addressing in Global Accelerator <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/about-accelerators.html#about-accelerators.dns-addressing>`__ in the *Global Accelerator Developer Guide*.
