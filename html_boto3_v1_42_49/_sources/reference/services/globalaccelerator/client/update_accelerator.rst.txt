.. py:method:: GlobalAccelerator.Client.update_accelerator(**kwargs)

  

  Update an accelerator to make changes, such as the following:

   

  
  * Change the name of the accelerator.
   
  * Disable the accelerator so that it no longer accepts or routes traffic, or so that you can delete it.
   
  * Enable the accelerator, if it is disabled.
   
  * Change the IP address type to dual-stack if it is IPv4, or change the IP address type to IPv4 if it's dual-stack.
  

   

  Be aware that static IP addresses remain assigned to your accelerator for as long as it exists, even if you disable the accelerator and it no longer accepts or routes traffic. However, when you delete the accelerator, you lose the static IP addresses that are assigned to it, so you can no longer route traffic by using them.

   

  .. warning::

     

    Global Accelerator is a global service that supports endpoints in multiple Amazon Web Services Regions but you must specify the US West (Oregon) Region to create, update, or otherwise work with accelerators. That is, for example, specify ``--region us-west-2`` on Amazon Web Services CLI commands.

        - **AcceleratorArn** *(string) --* 

          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the accelerator.

          
        

        - **Name** *(string) --* 

          The name of the accelerator. The name must contain only alphanumeric characters or hyphens (-), and must not begin or end with a hyphen.

        - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

          Indicates whether the accelerator is enabled. The value is true or false. The default value is true.

        - **DnsName** *(string) --* 

          The Domain Name System (DNS) name that Global Accelerator creates that points to an accelerator's static IPv4 addresses.

           

          The naming convention for the DNS name for an accelerator is the following: A lowercase letter a, followed by a 16-bit random hex string, followed by .awsglobalaccelerator.com. For example: a1234567890abcdef.awsglobalaccelerator.com.

           

          If you have a dual-stack accelerator, you also have a second DNS name, ``DualStackDnsName``, that points to both the A record and the AAAA record for all four static addresses for the accelerator: two IPv4 addresses and two IPv6 addresses.

           

          For more information about the default DNS name, see `Support for DNS addressing in Global Accelerator <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/dns-addressing-custom-domains.dns-addressing.html>`__ in the *Global Accelerator Developer Guide*.

        - **DualStackDnsName** *(string) --* 

          The Domain Name System (DNS) name that Global Accelerator creates that points to a dual-stack accelerator's four static IP addresses: two IPv4 addresses and two IPv6 addresses.

           

          The naming convention for the dual-stack DNS name is the following: A lowercase letter a, followed by a 16-bit random hex string, followed by .dualstack.awsglobalaccelerator.com. For example: a1234567890abcdef.dualstack.awsglobalaccelerator.com.

           

          Note: Global Accelerator also assigns a default DNS name, ``DnsName``, to your accelerator that points just to the static IPv4 addresses.

           

          For more information, see `Support for DNS addressing in Global Accelerator <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/about-accelerators.html#about-accelerators.dns-addressing>`__ in the *Global Accelerator Developer Guide*.
