.. py:method:: GlobalAccelerator.Client.advertise_byoip_cidr(**kwargs)

  

  Advertises an IPv4 address range that is provisioned for use with your Amazon Web Services resources through bring your own IP addresses (BYOIP). It can take a few minutes before traffic to the specified addresses starts routing to Amazon Web Services because of propagation delays.

   

  To stop advertising the BYOIP address range, use `WithdrawByoipCidr <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/api/WithdrawByoipCidr.html>`__.

   

  For more information, see `Bring your own IP addresses (BYOIP) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/using-byoip.html>`__ in the *Global Accelerator Developer Guide*.
