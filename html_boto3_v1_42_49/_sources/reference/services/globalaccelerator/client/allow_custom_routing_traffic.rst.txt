.. py:method:: GlobalAccelerator.Client.allow_custom_routing_traffic(**kwargs)

  

  Specify the Amazon EC2 instance (destination) IP addresses and ports for a VPC subnet endpoint that can receive traffic for a custom routing accelerator. You can allow traffic to all destinations in the subnet endpoint, or allow traffic to a specified list of destination IP addresses and ports in the subnet. Note that you cannot specify IP addresses or ports outside of the range that you configured for the endpoint group.

   

  After you make changes, you can verify that the updates are complete by checking the status of your accelerator: the status changes from IN_PROGRESS to DEPLOYED.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.allow_custom_routing_traffic(
        EndpointGroupArn='string',
        EndpointId='string',
        DestinationAddresses=[
            'string',
        ],
        DestinationPorts=[
            123,
        ],
        AllowAllTrafficToEndpoint=True|False
    )
    
  :type EndpointGroupArn: string
  :param EndpointGroupArn: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the endpoint group.

    

  
  :type EndpointId: string
  :param EndpointId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    An ID for the endpoint. For custom routing accelerators, this is the virtual private cloud (VPC) subnet ID.

    

  
  :type DestinationAddresses: list
  :param DestinationAddresses: 

    A list of specific Amazon EC2 instance IP addresses (destination addresses) in a subnet that you want to allow to receive traffic. The IP addresses must be a subset of the IP addresses that you specified for the endpoint group.

     

    ``DestinationAddresses`` is required if ``AllowAllTrafficToEndpoint`` is ``FALSE`` or is not specified.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type DestinationPorts: list
  :param DestinationPorts: 

    A list of specific Amazon EC2 instance ports (destination ports) that you want to allow to receive traffic.

    

  
    - *(integer) --* 

    

  :type AllowAllTrafficToEndpoint: boolean
  :param AllowAllTrafficToEndpoint: 

    Indicates whether all destination IP addresses and ports for a specified VPC subnet endpoint can receive traffic from a custom routing accelerator. The value is TRUE or FALSE.

     

    When set to TRUE, *all* destinations in the custom routing VPC subnet can receive traffic. Note that you cannot specify destination IP addresses and ports when the value is set to TRUE.

     

    When set to FALSE (or not specified), you *must* specify a list of destination IP addresses that are allowed to receive traffic. A list of ports is optional. If you don't specify a list of ports, the ports that can accept traffic is the same as the ports configured for the endpoint group.

     

    The default value is FALSE.
