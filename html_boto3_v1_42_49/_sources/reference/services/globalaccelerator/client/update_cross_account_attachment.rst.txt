.. py:method:: GlobalAccelerator.Client.update_cross_account_attachment(**kwargs)

  

  Update a cross-account attachment to add or remove principals or resources. When you update an attachment to remove a principal (account ID or accelerator) or a resource, Global Accelerator revokes the permission for specific resources.

   

  For more information, see `Working with cross-account attachments and resources in Global Accelerator <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/cross-account-resources.html>`__ in the *Global Accelerator Developer Guide*.
