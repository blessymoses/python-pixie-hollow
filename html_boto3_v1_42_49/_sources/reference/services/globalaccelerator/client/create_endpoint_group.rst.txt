.. py:method:: GlobalAccelerator.Client.create_endpoint_group(**kwargs)

  

  Create an endpoint group for the specified listener. An endpoint group is a collection of endpoints in one Amazon Web Services Region. A resource must be valid and active when you add it as an endpoint.

   

  For more information about endpoint types and requirements for endpoints that you can add to Global Accelerator, see `Endpoints for standard accelerators <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/about-endpoints.html>`__ in the *Global Accelerator Developer Guide*.

            },
        ]
    )
    
  :type ListenerArn: string
  :param ListenerArn: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the listener.

    

  
  :type EndpointGroupRegion: string
  :param EndpointGroupRegion: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The Amazon Web Services Region where the endpoint group is located. A listener can have only one endpoint group in a specific Region.

    

  
  :type EndpointConfigurations: list
  :param EndpointConfigurations: 

    The list of endpoint objects.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      A complex type for endpoints. A resource must be valid and active when you add it as an endpoint.

      

    
      - **EndpointId** *(string) --* 

        An ID for the endpoint. If the endpoint is a Network Load Balancer or Application Load Balancer, this is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource. If the endpoint is an Elastic IP address, this is the Elastic IP address allocation ID. For Amazon EC2 instances, this is the EC2 instance ID. A resource must be valid and active when you add it as an endpoint.

         

        For cross-account endpoints, this must be the ARN of the resource.

        

      
      - **Weight** *(integer) --* 

        The weight associated with the endpoint. When you add weights to endpoints, you configure Global Accelerator to route traffic based on proportions that you specify. For example, you might specify endpoint weights of 4, 5, 5, and 6 (sum=20). The result is that 4/20 of your traffic, on average, is routed to the first endpoint, 5/20 is routed both to the second and third endpoints, and 6/20 is routed to the last endpoint. For more information, see `Endpoint weights <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/about-endpoints-endpoint-weights.html>`__ in the *Global Accelerator Developer Guide*.

        

      
      - **ClientIPPreservationEnabled** *(boolean) --* 

        Indicates whether client IP address preservation is enabled for an endpoint. The value is true or false. The default value is true for Application Load Balancer endpoints.

         

        If the value is set to true, the client's IP address is preserved in the ``X-Forwarded-For`` request header as traffic travels to applications on the endpoint fronted by the accelerator.

         

        Client IP address preservation is supported, in specific Amazon Web Services Regions, for endpoints that are Application Load Balancers, Amazon EC2 instances, and Network Load Balancers with security groups. IMPORTANT: You cannot use client IP address preservation with Network Load Balancers with TLS listeners.

         

        For more information, see `Preserve client IP addresses in Global Accelerator <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/preserve-client-ip-address.html>`__ in the *Global Accelerator Developer Guide*.

        

      
      - **AttachmentArn** *(string) --* 

        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cross-account attachment that specifies the endpoints (resources) that can be added to accelerators and principals that have permission to add the endpoints.

        

      
    

  :type TrafficDialPercentage: float
  :param TrafficDialPercentage: 

    The percentage of traffic to send to an Amazon Web Services Region. Additional traffic is distributed to other endpoint groups for this listener.

     

    Use this action to increase (dial up) or decrease (dial down) traffic to a specific Region. The percentage is applied to the traffic that would otherwise have been routed to the Region based on optimal routing.

     

    The default value is 100.

    

  
  :type HealthCheckPort: integer
  :param HealthCheckPort: 

    The port that Global Accelerator uses to check the health of endpoints that are part of this endpoint group. The default port is the listener port that this endpoint group is associated with. If listener port is a list of ports, Global Accelerator uses the first port in the list.

    

  
  :type HealthCheckProtocol: string
  :param HealthCheckProtocol: 

    The protocol that Global Accelerator uses to check the health of endpoints that are part of this endpoint group. The default value is TCP.

    

  
  :type HealthCheckPath: string
  :param HealthCheckPath: 

    If the protocol is HTTP/S, then this specifies the path that is the destination for health check targets. The default value is slash (/).

    

  
  :type HealthCheckIntervalSeconds: integer
  :param HealthCheckIntervalSeconds: 

    The time—10 seconds or 30 seconds—between each health check for an endpoint. The default value is 30.

    

  
  :type ThresholdCount: integer
  :param ThresholdCount: 

    The number of consecutive health checks required to set the state of a healthy endpoint to unhealthy, or to set an unhealthy endpoint to healthy. The default value is 3.

    

  
  :type IdempotencyToken: string
  :param IdempotencyToken: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency—that is, the uniqueness—of the request.

    This field is autopopulated if not provided.

  
  :type PortOverrides: list
  :param PortOverrides: 

    Override specific listener ports used to route traffic to endpoints that are part of this endpoint group. For example, you can create a port override in which the listener receives user traffic on ports 80 and 443, but your accelerator routes that traffic to ports 1080 and 1443, respectively, on the endpoints.

     

    For more information, see `Overriding listener ports <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/about-endpoint-groups-port-override.html>`__ in the *Global Accelerator Developer Guide*.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      Override specific listener ports used to route traffic to endpoints that are part of an endpoint group. For example, you can create a port override in which the listener receives user traffic on ports 80 and 443, but your accelerator routes that traffic to ports 1080 and 1443, respectively, on the endpoints.

       

      For more information, see `Overriding listener ports <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/about-endpoint-groups-port-override.html>`__ in the *Global Accelerator Developer Guide*.

      

    
      - **ListenerPort** *(integer) --* 

        The listener port that you want to map to a specific endpoint port. This is the port that user traffic arrives to the Global Accelerator on.

        

      
      - **EndpointPort** *(integer) --* 

        The endpoint port that you want a listener port to be mapped to. This is the port on the endpoint, such as the Application Load Balancer or Amazon EC2 instance.
