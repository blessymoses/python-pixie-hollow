  :type OrganizationResourceCollectionType: string
  :param OrganizationResourceCollectionType: **[REQUIRED]** 

    An Amazon Web Services resource collection type. This type specifies how analyzed Amazon Web Services resources are defined. The two types of Amazon Web Services resource collections supported are Amazon Web Services CloudFormation stacks and Amazon Web Services resources that contain the same Amazon Web Services tag. DevOps Guru can be configured to analyze the Amazon Web Services resources that are defined in the stacks or that are tagged using the same tag *key*. You can specify up to 500 Amazon Web Services CloudFormation stacks.

    

  
  :type AccountIds: list
  :param AccountIds: 

    The ID of the Amazon Web Services account.

      - **Tags** *(list) --* 

        Tags help you identify and organize your Amazon Web Services resources. Many Amazon Web Services services support tagging, so you can assign the same tag to resources from different services to indicate that the resources are related. For example, you can assign the same tag to an Amazon DynamoDB table resource that you assign to an Lambda function. For more information about using tags, see the `Tagging best practices <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/tagging-best-practices/tagging-best-practices.html>`__ whitepaper.

         

        Each Amazon Web Services tag has two parts.

         

        
        * A tag *key* (for example, ``CostCenter``, ``Environment``, ``Project``, or ``Secret``). Tag *keys* are case-sensitive.
         
        * An optional field known as a tag *value* (for example, ``111122223333``, ``Production``, or a team name). Omitting the tag *value* is the same as using an empty string. Like tag *keys*, tag *values* are case-sensitive.
        

         

        Together these are known as *key*-*value* pairs.

         

        .. warning::

           

          The string used for a *key* in a tag that you use to define your resource coverage must begin with the prefix ``Devops-guru-``. The tag *key* might be ``DevOps-Guru-deployment-application`` or ``devops-guru-rds-application``. When you create a *key*, the case of characters in the *key* can be whatever you choose. After you create a *key*, it is case-sensitive. For example, DevOps Guru works with a *key* named ``devops-guru-rds`` and a *key* named ``DevOps-Guru-RDS``, and these act as two different *keys*. Possible *key*/*value* pairs in your application might be ``Devops-Guru-production-application/RDS`` or ``Devops-Guru-production-application/containers``.

          

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          Information about the health of Amazon Web Services resources in your account that are specified by an Amazon Web Services tag *key*.

          
          

          - **AppBoundaryKey** *(string) --* 

            An Amazon Web Services tag *key* that is used to identify the Amazon Web Services resources that DevOps Guru analyzes. All Amazon Web Services resources in your account and Region tagged with this *key* make up your DevOps Guru application and analysis boundary.

             

            .. warning::

          - **TagValue** *(string) --* 

            The value in an Amazon Web Services tag.

             

            The tag's *value* is an optional field used to associate a string with the tag *key* (for example, ``111122223333``, ``Production``, or a team name). The *key* and *value* are the tag's *key* pair. Omitting the tag *value* is the same as using an empty string. Like tag *keys*, tag *values* are case-sensitive. You can specify a maximum of 256 characters for a tag value.

            
          

          - **Insight** *(dict) --* 

            Information about the health of the Amazon Web Services resources in your account that are specified by an Amazon Web Services tag, including the number of open proactive, open reactive insights, and the Mean Time to Recover (MTTR) of closed insights.

            
            

            - **OpenProactiveInsights** *(integer) --* 

              The number of open proactive insights.

              
            

            - **OpenReactiveInsights** *(integer) --* 

              The number of open reactive insights.

              
            

            - **MeanTimeToRecoverInMilliseconds** *(integer) --* 

              The Meant Time to Recover (MTTR) for the insight.

              
        
          

          - **AnalyzedResourceCount** *(integer) --* 

            Number of resources that DevOps Guru is monitoring in your account that are specified by an Amazon Web Services tag.
