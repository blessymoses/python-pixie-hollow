    :type Filters: dict
    :param Filters: **[REQUIRED]** 

      A ``ListEventsFilters`` object used to specify which events to return.

      

    
      - **InsightId** *(string) --* 

        An ID of an insight that is related to the events you want to filter for.

        

      
      - **EventTimeRange** *(dict) --* 

        A time range during which you want the filtered events to have occurred.

        

      
        - **FromTime** *(datetime) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The time when the event started.

          

        
        - **ToTime** *(datetime) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The time when the event ended.

          

        
      
      - **EventClass** *(string) --* 

        The class of the events you want to filter for, such as an infrastructure change, a deployment, or a schema change.

        

      
      - **EventSource** *(string) --* 

        The Amazon Web Services source that emitted the events you want to filter for.

        

      
      - **DataSource** *(string) --* 

        The source, ``AWS_CLOUD_TRAIL`` or ``AWS_CODE_DEPLOY``, of the events you want returned.

        

      
      - **ResourceCollection** *(dict) --* 

        A collection of Amazon Web Services resources supported by DevOps Guru. The two types of Amazon Web Services resource collections supported are Amazon Web Services CloudFormation stacks and Amazon Web Services resources that contain the same Amazon Web Services tag. DevOps Guru can be configured to analyze the Amazon Web Services resources that are defined in the stacks or that are tagged using the same tag *key*. You can specify up to 500 Amazon Web Services CloudFormation stacks.

        

      
        - **CloudFormation** *(dict) --* 

          An array of the names of Amazon Web Services CloudFormation stacks. The stacks define Amazon Web Services resources that DevOps Guru analyzes. You can specify up to 500 Amazon Web Services CloudFormation stacks.

          

        
          - **StackNames** *(list) --* 

            An array of CloudFormation stack names.

            

          
            - *(string) --* 

            
        
        
        - **Tags** *(list) --* 

          The Amazon Web Services tags that are used by resources in the resource collection.

           

          Tags help you identify and organize your Amazon Web Services resources. Many Amazon Web Services services support tagging, so you can assign the same tag to resources from different services to indicate that the resources are related. For example, you can assign the same tag to an Amazon DynamoDB table resource that you assign to an Lambda function. For more information about using tags, see the `Tagging best practices <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/tagging-best-practices/tagging-best-practices.html>`__ whitepaper.

           

          Each Amazon Web Services tag has two parts.

           

          
          * A tag *key* (for example, ``CostCenter``, ``Environment``, ``Project``, or ``Secret``). Tag *keys* are case-sensitive.
           
          * An optional field known as a tag *value* (for example, ``111122223333``, ``Production``, or a team name). Omitting the tag *value* is the same as using an empty string. Like tag *keys*, tag *values* are case-sensitive.
          

           

          Together these are known as *key*-*value* pairs.

           

          .. warning::

             

            The string used for a *key* in a tag that you use to define your resource coverage must begin with the prefix ``Devops-guru-``. The tag *key* might be ``DevOps-Guru-deployment-application`` or ``devops-guru-rds-application``. When you create a *key*, the case of characters in the *key* can be whatever you choose. After you create a *key*, it is case-sensitive. For example, DevOps Guru works with a *key* named ``devops-guru-rds`` and a *key* named ``DevOps-Guru-RDS``, and these act as two different *keys*. Possible *key*/*value* pairs in your application might be ``Devops-Guru-production-application/RDS`` or ``Devops-Guru-production-application/containers``.

              The values in an Amazon Web Services tag collection.

               

              The tag's *value* is an optional field used to associate a string with the tag *key* (for example, ``111122223333``, ``Production``, or a team name). The *key* and *value* are the tag's *key* pair. Omitting the tag *value* is the same as using an empty string. Like tag *keys*, tag *values* are case-sensitive.

      - **MaxItems** *(integer) --* 

        The total number of items to return. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified in max-items then a ``NextToken`` will be provided in the output that you can use to resume pagination.

        

      
      - **PageSize** *(integer) --* 

        The size of each page.

                    The values in an Amazon Web Services tag collection.

                     

                    The tag's *value* is an optional field used to associate a string with the tag *key* (for example, ``111122223333``, ``Production``, or a team name). The *key* and *value* are the tag's *key* pair. Omitting the tag *value* is the same as using an empty string. Like tag *keys*, tag *values* are case-sensitive. You can specify a maximum of 256 characters for a tag value.
