        .. warning::

           

          Amazon Translate doesn't scan all input files for the risk of CSV injection attacks.

           

          CSV injection occurs when a .csv or .tsv file is altered so that a record contains malicious code. The record begins with a special character, such as =, +, -, or @. When the file is opened in a spreadsheet program, the program might interpret the record as a formula and run the code within it.

           

          Before you download an input file from Amazon S3, ensure that you recognize the file and trust its creator.

          

        
        

        - **RepositoryType** *(string) --*
