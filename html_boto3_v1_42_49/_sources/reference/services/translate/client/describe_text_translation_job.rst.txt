          - **ContentType** *(string) --* 

            Describes the format of the data that you submit to Amazon Translate as input. You can specify one of the following multipurpose internet mail extension (MIME) types:

             

            
            * ``text/html``: The input data consists of one or more HTML files. Amazon Translate translates only the text that resides in the ``html`` element in each file.
             
            * ``text/plain``: The input data consists of one or more unformatted text files. Amazon Translate translates every character in this type of input.
             
            * ``application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document``: The input data consists of one or more Word documents (.docx).
             
            * ``application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation``: The input data consists of one or more PowerPoint Presentation files (.pptx).
             
            * ``application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet``: The input data consists of one or more Excel Workbook files (.xlsx).
             
            * ``application/x-xliff+xml``: The input data consists of one or more XML Localization Interchange File Format (XLIFF) files (.xlf). Amazon Translate supports only XLIFF version 1.2.
            

             

            .. warning::

               

              If you structure your input data as HTML, ensure that you set this parameter to ``text/html``. By doing so, you cut costs by limiting the translation to the contents of the ``html`` element in each file. Otherwise, if you set this parameter to ``text/plain``, your costs will cover the translation of every character.

              

            
      
        

        - **OutputDataConfig** *(dict) --* 

          The output configuration properties that were specified when the job was requested.

          
          

          - **S3Uri** *(string) --* 

            The URI of the S3 folder that contains a translation job's output file. The folder must be in the same Region as the API endpoint that you are calling.

            
          

          - **EncryptionKey** *(dict) --* 

            The encryption key used to encrypt this object.

            
            

            - **Type** *(string) --* 

              The type of encryption key used by Amazon Translate to encrypt this object.

              
            

            - **Id** *(string) --* 

              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the encryption key being used to encrypt this object.

              
        
      
        

        - **DataAccessRoleArn** *(string) --* 

          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS Identity Access and Management (IAM) role that granted Amazon Translate read access to the job's input data.

          
        

        - **Settings** *(dict) --* 

          Settings that modify the translation output.

          
          

          - **Formality** *(string) --* 

            You can specify the desired level of formality for translations to supported target languages. The formality setting controls the level of formal language usage (also known as `register <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_(sociolinguistics)>`__) in the translation output. You can set the value to informal or formal. If you don't specify a value for formality, or if the target language doesn't support formality, the translation will ignore the formality setting.

             

            If you specify multiple target languages for the job, translate ignores the formality setting for any unsupported target language.

             

            For a list of target languages that support formality, see `Supported languages <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/translate/latest/dg/customizing-translations-formality.html#customizing-translations-formality-languages>`__ in the Amazon Translate Developer Guide.

            
          

          - **Profanity** *(string) --* 

            You can enable the profanity setting if you want to mask profane words and phrases in your translation output.

             

            To mask profane words and phrases, Amazon Translate replaces them with the grawlix string “?$#@$“. This 5-character sequence is used for each profane word or phrase, regardless of the length or number of words.

             

            Amazon Translate doesn't detect profanity in all of its supported languages. For languages that don't support profanity detection, see `Unsupported languages <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/translate/latest/dg/customizing-translations-profanity.html#customizing-translations-profanity-languages>`__ in the Amazon Translate Developer Guide.

             

            If you specify multiple target languages for the job, all the target languages must support profanity masking. If any of the target languages don't support profanity masking, the translation job won't mask profanity for any target language.

            
          

          - **Brevity** *(string) --* 

            When you turn on brevity, Amazon Translate reduces the length of the translation output for most translations (when compared with the same translation with brevity turned off). By default, brevity is turned off.

             

            If you turn on brevity for a translation request with an unsupported language pair, the translation proceeds with the brevity setting turned off.

             

            For the language pairs that brevity supports, see `Using brevity <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/translate/latest/dg/customizing-translations-brevity>`__ in the Amazon Translate Developer Guide.
