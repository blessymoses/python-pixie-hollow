  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.get_terminology(
        Name='string',
        TerminologyDataFormat='CSV'|'TMX'|'TSV'
    )
    
  :type Name: string
  :param Name: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of the custom terminology being retrieved.

    

  
  :type TerminologyDataFormat: string
  :param TerminologyDataFormat: 

    The data format of the custom terminology being retrieved.

     

    If you don't specify this parameter, Amazon Translate returns a file with the same format as the file that was imported to create the terminology.

     

    If you specify this parameter when you retrieve a multi-directional terminology resource, you must specify the same format as the input file that was imported to create it. Otherwise, Amazon Translate throws an error.

        .. warning::

           

          Amazon Translate doesn't scan all input files for the risk of CSV injection attacks.

           

          CSV injection occurs when a .csv or .tsv file is altered so that a record contains malicious code. The record begins with a special character, such as =, +, -, or @. When the file is opened in a spreadsheet program, the program might interpret the record as a formula and run the code within it.

           

          Before you download an input file from Amazon S3, ensure that you recognize the file and trust its creator.
