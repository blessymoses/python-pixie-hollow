    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **Members** *(list) --* 

        An array of ``MemberSummary`` objects. Each object contains details about a network member.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          A summary of configuration properties for a member.

           

          Applies only to Hyperledger Fabric.

          
          

          - **Id** *(string) --* 

            The unique identifier of the member.

            
          

          - **Name** *(string) --* 

            The name of the member.

            
          

          - **Description** *(string) --* 

            An optional description of the member.

            
          

          - **Status** *(string) --* 

            The status of the member.

             

            
            * ``CREATING`` - The Amazon Web Services account is in the process of creating a member.
             
            * ``AVAILABLE`` - The member has been created and can participate in the network.
             
            * ``CREATE_FAILED`` - The Amazon Web Services account attempted to create a member and creation failed.
             
            * ``UPDATING`` - The member is in the process of being updated.
             
            * ``DELETING`` - The member and all associated resources are in the process of being deleted. Either the Amazon Web Services account that owns the member deleted it, or the member is being deleted as the result of an ``APPROVED`` ``PROPOSAL`` to remove the member.
             
            * ``DELETED`` - The member can no longer participate on the network and all associated resources are deleted. Either the Amazon Web Services account that owns the member deleted it, or the member is being deleted as the result of an ``APPROVED`` ``PROPOSAL`` to remove the member.
             
            * ``INACCESSIBLE_ENCRYPTION_KEY`` - The member is impaired and might not function as expected because it cannot access the specified customer managed key in Key Management Service (KMS) for encryption at rest. Either the KMS key was disabled or deleted, or the grants on the key were revoked. The effect of disabling or deleting a key or of revoking a grant isn't immediate. It might take some time for the member resource to discover that the key is inaccessible. When a resource is in this state, we recommend deleting and recreating the resource.
            

            
          

          - **CreationDate** *(datetime) --* 

            The date and time that the member was created.

            
          

          - **IsOwned** *(boolean) --* 

            An indicator of whether the member is owned by your Amazon Web Services account or a different Amazon Web Services account.

            
          

          - **Arn** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the member. For more information about ARNs and their format, see `Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*.

            
      
    
      

      - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

        The pagination token that indicates the next set of results to retrieve.
