          - **Status** *(string) --* 

            The status of the proposal. Values are as follows:

             

            
            * ``IN_PROGRESS`` - The proposal is active and open for member voting.
             
            * ``APPROVED`` - The proposal was approved with sufficient ``YES`` votes among members according to the ``VotingPolicy`` specified for the ``Network``. The specified proposal actions are carried out.
             
            * ``REJECTED`` - The proposal was rejected with insufficient ``YES`` votes among members according to the ``VotingPolicy`` specified for the ``Network``. The specified ``ProposalActions`` aren't carried out.
             
            * ``EXPIRED`` - Members didn't cast the number of votes required to determine the proposal outcome before the proposal expired. The specified ``ProposalActions`` aren't carried out.
             
            * ``ACTION_FAILED`` - One or more of the specified ``ProposalActions`` in a proposal that was approved couldn't be completed because of an error.

After this date and time, if members haven't cast enough votes to determine the outcome according to the voting policy, the proposal is ``EXPIRED`` and ``Actions`` aren't carried out.
