.. py:method:: ManagedBlockchain.Client.delete_member(**kwargs)

  

  Deletes a member. Deleting a member removes the member and all associated resources from the network. ``DeleteMember`` can only be called for a specified ``MemberId`` if the principal performing the action is associated with the Amazon Web Services account that owns the member. In all other cases, the ``DeleteMember`` action is carried out as the result of an approved proposal to remove a member. If ``MemberId`` is the last member in a network specified by the last Amazon Web Services account, the network is deleted also.

   

  Applies only to Hyperledger Fabric.
