.. py:class:: MQ.Client

  A low-level client representing AmazonMQ
  

  Amazon MQ is a managed message broker service for Apache ActiveMQ and RabbitMQ that makes it easy to set up and operate message brokers in the cloud. A message broker allows software applications and components to communicate using various programming languages, operating systems, and formal messaging protocols.
