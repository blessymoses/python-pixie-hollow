.. py:method:: WAFV2.Client.update_ip_set(**kwargs)

  

  Updates the specified  IPSet.

   

  .. note::

    

    This operation completely replaces the mutable specifications that you already have for the IP set with the ones that you provide to this call.

     

    To modify an IP set, do the following:

     

    
    * Retrieve it by calling  GetIPSet
     
    * Update its settings as needed
     
    * Provide the complete IP set specification to this call
    

    

   

  **Temporary inconsistencies during updates**

   

  When you create or change a web ACL or other WAF resources, the changes take a small amount of time to propagate to all areas where the resources are stored. The propagation time can be from a few seconds to a number of minutes.

   

  The following are examples of the temporary inconsistencies that you might notice during change propagation:

   

  
  * After you create a web ACL, if you try to associate it with a resource, you might get an exception indicating that the web ACL is unavailable.
   
  * After you add a rule group to a web ACL, the new rule group rules might be in effect in one area where the web ACL is used and not in another.
   
  * After you change a rule action setting, you might see the old action in some places and the new action in others.
   
  * After you add an IP address to an IP set that is in use in a blocking rule, the new address might be blocked in one area while still allowed in another.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.update_ip_set(
        Name='string',
        Scope='CLOUDFRONT'|'REGIONAL',
        Id='string',
        Description='string',
        Addresses=[
            'string',
        ],
        LockToken='string'
    )
    
  :type Name: string
  :param Name: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of the IP set. You cannot change the name of an ``IPSet`` after you create it.

    

  
  :type Scope: string
  :param Scope: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies whether this is for a global resource type, such as a Amazon CloudFront distribution. For an Amplify application, use ``CLOUDFRONT``.

     

    To work with CloudFront, you must also specify the Region US East (N. Virginia) as follows:

     

    
    * CLI - Specify the Region when you use the CloudFront scope: ``--scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1``.
     
    * API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.
    

    

  
  :type Id: string
  :param Id: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A unique identifier for the set. This ID is returned in the responses to create and list commands. You provide it to operations like update and delete.

    

  
  :type Description: string
  :param Description: 

    A description of the IP set that helps with identification.

    

  
  :type Addresses: list
  :param Addresses: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Contains an array of strings that specifies zero or more IP addresses or blocks of IP addresses that you want WAF to inspect for in incoming requests. All addresses must be specified using Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation. WAF supports all IPv4 and IPv6 CIDR ranges except for ``/0``.

     

    Example address strings:

     

    
    * For requests that originated from the IP address 192.0.2.44, specify ``192.0.2.44/32``.
     
    * For requests that originated from IP addresses from 192.0.2.0 to 192.0.2.255, specify ``192.0.2.0/24``.
     
    * For requests that originated from the IP address 1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0111, specify ``1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0111/128``.
     
    * For requests that originated from IP addresses 1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000 to 1111:0000:0000:0000:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff, specify ``1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000/64``.
    

     

    For more information about CIDR notation, see the Wikipedia entry `Classless Inter-Domain Routing <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing>`__.

     

    Example JSON ``Addresses`` specifications:

     

    
    * Empty array: ``"Addresses": []``
     
    * Array with one address: ``"Addresses": ["192.0.2.44/32"]``
     
    * Array with three addresses: ``"Addresses": ["192.0.2.44/32", "192.0.2.0/24", "192.0.0.0/16"]``
     
    * INVALID specification: ``"Addresses": [""]`` INVALID
    

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type LockToken: string
  :param LockToken: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A token used for optimistic locking. WAF returns a token to your ``get`` and ``list`` requests, to mark the state of the entity at the time of the request. To make changes to the entity associated with the token, you provide the token to operations like ``update`` and ``delete``. WAF uses the token to ensure that no changes have been made to the entity since you last retrieved it. If a change has been made, the update fails with a ``WAFOptimisticLockException``. If this happens, perform another ``get``, and use the new token returned by that operation.

    **Response Syntax**

    
    ::

      {
          'NextLockToken': 'string'
      }
      
    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **NextLockToken** *(string) --* 

        A token used for optimistic locking. WAF returns this token to your ``update`` requests. You use ``NextLockToken`` in the same manner as you use ``LockToken``.
