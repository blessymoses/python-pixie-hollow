.. py:method:: WAFV2.Client.put_permission_policy(**kwargs)

  

  Use this to share a rule group with other accounts.

   

  This action attaches an IAM policy to the specified resource. You must be the owner of the rule group to perform this operation.

   

  This action is subject to the following restrictions:

   

  
  * You can attach only one policy with each ``PutPermissionPolicy`` request.
   
  * The ARN in the request must be a valid WAF  RuleGroup ARN and the rule group must exist in the same Region.
   
  * The user making the request must be the owner of the rule group.
  

   

  If a rule group has been shared with your account, you can access it through the call ``GetRuleGroup``, and you can reference it in ``CreateWebACL`` and ``UpdateWebACL``. Rule groups that are shared with you don't appear in your WAF console rule groups listing.

    )
    
  :type ResourceArn: string
  :param ResourceArn: **[REQUIRED]**

    The policy specifications must conform to the following:

     

    
    * The policy must be composed using IAM Policy version 2012-10-17.
     
    * The policy must include specifications for ``Effect``, ``Action``, and ``Principal``.
     
    * ``Effect`` must specify ``Allow``.
     
    * ``Action`` must specify ``wafv2:CreateWebACL``, ``wafv2:UpdateWebACL``, and ``wafv2:PutFirewallManagerRuleGroups`` and may optionally specify ``wafv2:GetRuleGroup``. WAF rejects any extra actions or wildcard actions in the policy.
     
    * The policy must not include a ``Resource`` parameter.
