  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_web_acls(
        Scope='CLOUDFRONT'|'REGIONAL',
        NextMarker='string',
        Limit=123
    )
    
  :type Scope: string
  :param Scope: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies whether this is for a global resource type, such as a Amazon CloudFront distribution. For an Amplify application, use ``CLOUDFRONT``.

     

    To work with CloudFront, you must also specify the Region US East (N. Virginia) as follows:

     

    
    * CLI - Specify the Region when you use the CloudFront scope: ``--scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1``.
     
    * API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.
    

    

  
  :type NextMarker: string
  :param NextMarker: 

    When you request a list of objects with a ``Limit`` setting, if the number of objects that are still available for retrieval exceeds the limit, WAF returns a ``NextMarker`` value in the response. To retrieve the next batch of objects, provide the marker from the prior call in your next request.

    

  
  :type Limit: integer
  :param Limit: 

    The maximum number of objects that you want WAF to return for this request. If more objects are available, in the response, WAF provides a ``NextMarker`` value that you can use in a subsequent call to get the next batch of objects.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **NextMarker** *(string) --* 

        When you request a list of objects with a ``Limit`` setting, if the number of objects that are still available for retrieval exceeds the limit, WAF returns a ``NextMarker`` value in the response. To retrieve the next batch of objects, provide the marker from the prior call in your next request.

        
      

      - **WebACLs** *(list) --* 

        Array of web ACLs. If you specified a ``Limit`` in your request, this might not be the full list.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          High-level information about a  WebACL, returned by operations like create and list. This provides information like the ID, that you can use to retrieve and manage a ``WebACL``, and the ARN, that you provide to operations like  AssociateWebACL.

          
          

          - **Name** *(string) --* 

            The name of the web ACL. You cannot change the name of a web ACL after you create it.

            
          

          - **Id** *(string) --* 

            The unique identifier for the web ACL. This ID is returned in the responses to create and list commands. You provide it to operations like update and delete.

            
          

          - **Description** *(string) --* 

            A description of the web ACL that helps with identification.

            
          

          - **LockToken** *(string) --* 

            A token used for optimistic locking. WAF returns a token to your ``get`` and ``list`` requests, to mark the state of the entity at the time of the request. To make changes to the entity associated with the token, you provide the token to operations like ``update`` and ``delete``. WAF uses the token to ensure that no changes have been made to the entity since you last retrieved it. If a change has been made, the update fails with a ``WAFOptimisticLockException``. If this happens, perform another ``get``, and use the new token returned by that operation.

            
          

          - **ARN** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the entity.
