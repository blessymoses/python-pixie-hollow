.. py:method:: WAFV2.Client.update_managed_rule_set_version_expiry_date(**kwargs)

  

  Updates the expiration information for your managed rule set. Use this to initiate the expiration of a managed rule group version. After you initiate expiration for a version, WAF excludes it from the response to  ListAvailableManagedRuleGroupVersions for the managed rule group.

   

  .. note::

    

    This is intended for use only by vendors of managed rule sets. Vendors are Amazon Web Services and Amazon Web Services Marketplace sellers.

     

    Vendors, you can use the managed rule set APIs to provide controlled rollout of your versioned managed rule group offerings for your customers. The APIs are ``ListManagedRuleSets``, ``GetManagedRuleSet``, ``PutManagedRuleSetVersions``, and ``UpdateManagedRuleSetVersionExpiryDate``.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.update_managed_rule_set_version_expiry_date(
        Name='string',
        Scope='CLOUDFRONT'|'REGIONAL',
        Id='string',
        LockToken='string',
        VersionToExpire='string',
        ExpiryTimestamp=datetime(2015, 1, 1)
    )
    
  :type Name: string
  :param Name: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of the managed rule set. You use this, along with the rule set ID, to identify the rule set.

     

    This name is assigned to the corresponding managed rule group, which your customers can access and use.

    

  
  :type Scope: string
  :param Scope: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies whether this is for a global resource type, such as a Amazon CloudFront distribution. For an Amplify application, use ``CLOUDFRONT``.

     

    To work with CloudFront, you must also specify the Region US East (N. Virginia) as follows:

     

    
    * CLI - Specify the Region when you use the CloudFront scope: ``--scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1``.
     
    * API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.
    

    

  
  :type Id: string
  :param Id: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A unique identifier for the managed rule set. The ID is returned in the responses to commands like ``list``. You provide it to operations like ``get`` and ``update``.

    

  
  :type LockToken: string
  :param LockToken: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A token used for optimistic locking. WAF returns a token to your ``get`` and ``list`` requests, to mark the state of the entity at the time of the request. To make changes to the entity associated with the token, you provide the token to operations like ``update`` and ``delete``. WAF uses the token to ensure that no changes have been made to the entity since you last retrieved it. If a change has been made, the update fails with a ``WAFOptimisticLockException``. If this happens, perform another ``get``, and use the new token returned by that operation.

    

  
  :type VersionToExpire: string
  :param VersionToExpire: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The version that you want to remove from your list of offerings for the named managed rule group.

    

  
  :type ExpiryTimestamp: datetime
  :param ExpiryTimestamp: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The time that you want the version to expire.

     

    Times are in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) format. UTC format includes the special designator, Z. For example, "2016-09-27T14:50Z".
