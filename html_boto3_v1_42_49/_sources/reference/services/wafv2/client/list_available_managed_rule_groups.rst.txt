  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_available_managed_rule_groups(
        Scope='CLOUDFRONT'|'REGIONAL',
        NextMarker='string',
        Limit=123
    )
    
  :type Scope: string
  :param Scope: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies whether this is for a global resource type, such as a Amazon CloudFront distribution. For an Amplify application, use ``CLOUDFRONT``.

     

    To work with CloudFront, you must also specify the Region US East (N. Virginia) as follows:

     

    
    * CLI - Specify the Region when you use the CloudFront scope: ``--scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1``.
     
    * API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.
    

    

  
  :type NextMarker: string
  :param NextMarker: 

    When you request a list of objects with a ``Limit`` setting, if the number of objects that are still available for retrieval exceeds the limit, WAF returns a ``NextMarker`` value in the response. To retrieve the next batch of objects, provide the marker from the prior call in your next request.

    

  
  :type Limit: integer
  :param Limit: 

    The maximum number of objects that you want WAF to return for this request. If more objects are available, in the response, WAF provides a ``NextMarker`` value that you can use in a subsequent call to get the next batch of objects.

        - *(dict) --* 

          High-level information about a managed rule group, returned by  ListAvailableManagedRuleGroups. This provides information like the name and vendor name, that you provide when you add a  ManagedRuleGroupStatement to a web ACL. Managed rule groups include Amazon Web Services Managed Rules rule groups and Amazon Web Services Marketplace managed rule groups. To use any Amazon Web Services Marketplace managed rule group, first subscribe to the rule group through Amazon Web Services Marketplace.

          
          

          - **VendorName** *(string) --* 

            The name of the managed rule group vendor. You use this, along with the rule group name, to identify a rule group.

            
          

          - **Name** *(string) --* 

            The name of the managed rule group. You use this, along with the vendor name, to identify the rule group.

            
          

          - **VersioningSupported** *(boolean) --* 

            Indicates whether the managed rule group is versioned. If it is, you can retrieve the versions list by calling  ListAvailableManagedRuleGroupVersions.

            
          

          - **Description** *(string) --* 

            The description of the managed rule group, provided by Amazon Web Services Managed Rules or the Amazon Web Services Marketplace seller who manages it.
