.. py:method:: WAFV2.Client.put_managed_rule_set_versions(**kwargs)

  

  Defines the versions of your managed rule set that you are offering to the customers. Customers see your offerings as managed rule groups with versioning.

   

  .. note::

    

    This is intended for use only by vendors of managed rule sets. Vendors are Amazon Web Services and Amazon Web Services Marketplace sellers.

     

    Vendors, you can use the managed rule set APIs to provide controlled rollout of your versioned managed rule group offerings for your customers. The APIs are ``ListManagedRuleSets``, ``GetManagedRuleSet``, ``PutManagedRuleSetVersions``, and ``UpdateManagedRuleSetVersionExpiryDate``.

    

   

  Customers retrieve their managed rule group list by calling  ListAvailableManagedRuleGroups. The name that you provide here for your managed rule set is the name the customer sees for the corresponding managed rule group. Customers can retrieve the available versions for a managed rule group by calling  ListAvailableManagedRuleGroupVersions. You provide a rule group specification for each version. For each managed rule set, you must specify a version that you recommend using.

   

  To initiate the expiration of a managed rule group version, use  UpdateManagedRuleSetVersionExpiryDate.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.put_managed_rule_set_versions(
        Name='string',
        Scope='CLOUDFRONT'|'REGIONAL',
        Id='string',
        LockToken='string',
        RecommendedVersion='string',
        VersionsToPublish={
            'string': {
                'AssociatedRuleGroupArn': 'string',
                'ForecastedLifetime': 123
            }
        }
    )
    
  :type Name: string
  :param Name: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of the managed rule set. You use this, along with the rule set ID, to identify the rule set.

     

    This name is assigned to the corresponding managed rule group, which your customers can access and use.

    

  
  :type Scope: string
  :param Scope: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies whether this is for a global resource type, such as a Amazon CloudFront distribution. For an Amplify application, use ``CLOUDFRONT``.

     

    To work with CloudFront, you must also specify the Region US East (N. Virginia) as follows:

     

    
    * CLI - Specify the Region when you use the CloudFront scope: ``--scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1``.
     
    * API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.
    

    

  
  :type Id: string
  :param Id: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A unique identifier for the managed rule set. The ID is returned in the responses to commands like ``list``. You provide it to operations like ``get`` and ``update``.

    

  
  :type LockToken: string
  :param LockToken: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A token used for optimistic locking. WAF returns a token to your ``get`` and ``list`` requests, to mark the state of the entity at the time of the request. To make changes to the entity associated with the token, you provide the token to operations like ``update`` and ``delete``. WAF uses the token to ensure that no changes have been made to the entity since you last retrieved it. If a change has been made, the update fails with a ``WAFOptimisticLockException``. If this happens, perform another ``get``, and use the new token returned by that operation.

    

  
  :type RecommendedVersion: string
  :param RecommendedVersion: 

    The version of the named managed rule group that you'd like your customers to choose, from among your version offerings.

    

  
  :type VersionsToPublish: dict
  :param VersionsToPublish: 

    The versions of the named managed rule group that you want to offer to your customers.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        A version of the named managed rule group, that the rule group's vendor publishes for use by customers.

         

        .. note::

          

          This is intended for use only by vendors of managed rule sets. Vendors are Amazon Web Services and Amazon Web Services Marketplace sellers.

        - **AssociatedRuleGroupArn** *(string) --* 

          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the vendor's rule group that's used in the published managed rule group version.

          

        
        - **ForecastedLifetime** *(integer) --* 

          The amount of time the vendor expects this version of the managed rule group to last, in days.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **NextLockToken** *(string) --* 

        A token used for optimistic locking. WAF returns a token to your ``get`` and ``list`` requests, to mark the state of the entity at the time of the request. To make changes to the entity associated with the token, you provide the token to operations like ``update`` and ``delete``. WAF uses the token to ensure that no changes have been made to the entity since you last retrieved it. If a change has been made, the update fails with a ``WAFOptimisticLockException``. If this happens, perform another ``get``, and use the new token returned by that operation.
