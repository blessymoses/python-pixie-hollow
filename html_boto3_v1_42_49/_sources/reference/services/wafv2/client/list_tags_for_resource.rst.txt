.. py:method:: WAFV2.Client.list_tags_for_resource(**kwargs)

  

  Retrieves the  TagInfoForResource for the specified resource. Tags are key:value pairs that you can use to categorize and manage your resources, for purposes like billing. For example, you might set the tag key to "customer" and the value to the customer name or ID. You can specify one or more tags to add to each Amazon Web Services resource, up to 50 tags for a resource.

   

  You can tag the Amazon Web Services resources that you manage through WAF: web ACLs, rule groups, IP sets, and regex pattern sets. You can't manage or view tags through the WAF console.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_tags_for_resource(
        NextMarker='string',
        Limit=123,
        ResourceARN='string'
    )
    
  :type NextMarker: string
  :param NextMarker: 

    When you request a list of objects with a ``Limit`` setting, if the number of objects that are still available for retrieval exceeds the limit, WAF returns a ``NextMarker`` value in the response. To retrieve the next batch of objects, provide the marker from the prior call in your next request.

    

  
  :type Limit: integer
  :param Limit: 

    The maximum number of objects that you want WAF to return for this request. If more objects are available, in the response, WAF provides a ``NextMarker`` value that you can use in a subsequent call to get the next batch of objects.

    

  
  :type ResourceARN: string
  :param ResourceARN: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource.

            A tag associated with an Amazon Web Services resource. Tags are key:value pairs that you can use to categorize and manage your resources, for purposes like billing or other management. Typically, the tag key represents a category, such as "environment", and the tag value represents a specific value within that category, such as "test," "development," or "production". Or you might set the tag key to "customer" and the value to the customer name or ID. You can specify one or more tags to add to each Amazon Web Services resource, up to 50 tags for a resource.
