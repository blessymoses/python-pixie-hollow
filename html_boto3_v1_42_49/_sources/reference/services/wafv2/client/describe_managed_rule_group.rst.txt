  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.describe_managed_rule_group(
        VendorName='string',
        Name='string',
        Scope='CLOUDFRONT'|'REGIONAL',
        VersionName='string'
    )
    
  :type VendorName: string
  :param VendorName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of the managed rule group vendor. You use this, along with the rule group name, to identify a rule group.

    

  
  :type Name: string
  :param Name: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of the managed rule group. You use this, along with the vendor name, to identify the rule group.

    

  
  :type Scope: string
  :param Scope: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies whether this is for a global resource type, such as a Amazon CloudFront distribution. For an Amplify application, use ``CLOUDFRONT``.

     

    To work with CloudFront, you must also specify the Region US East (N. Virginia) as follows:

     

    
    * CLI - Specify the Region when you use the CloudFront scope: ``--scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1``.
     
    * API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.
    

    

  
  :type VersionName: string
  :param VersionName: 

    The version of the rule group. You can only use a version that is not scheduled for expiration. If you don't provide this, WAF uses the vendor's default version.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **VersionName** *(string) --* 

        The managed rule group's version.

        
      

      - **SnsTopicArn** *(string) --* 

        The Amazon resource name (ARN) of the Amazon Simple Notification Service SNS topic that's used to provide notification of changes to the managed rule group. You can subscribe to the SNS topic to receive notifications when the managed rule group is modified, such as for new versions and for version expiration. For more information, see the `Amazon Simple Notification Service Developer Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/welcome.html>`__.

        
      

      - **Capacity** *(integer) --* 

        The web ACL capacity units (WCUs) required for this rule group.

         

        WAF uses WCUs to calculate and control the operating resources that are used to run your rules, rule groups, and web ACLs. WAF calculates capacity differently for each rule type, to reflect the relative cost of each rule. Simple rules that cost little to run use fewer WCUs than more complex rules that use more processing power. Rule group capacity is fixed at creation, which helps users plan their web ACL WCU usage when they use a rule group. For more information, see `WAF web ACL capacity units (WCU) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/aws-waf-capacity-units.html>`__ in the *WAF Developer Guide*.

        
      

      - **Rules** *(list) --* 
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          High-level information about a  Rule, returned by operations like  DescribeManagedRuleGroup. This provides information like the ID, that you can use to retrieve and manage a ``RuleGroup``, and the ARN, that you provide to the  RuleGroupReferenceStatement to use the rule group in a  Rule.

          
          

          - **Name** *(string) --* 

            The name of the rule.

            
          

          - **Action** *(dict) --* 

            The action that WAF should take on a web request when it matches a rule's statement. Settings at the web ACL level can override the rule action setting.

            
            

            - **Block** *(dict) --* 

              Instructs WAF to block the web request.

              
              

              - **CustomResponse** *(dict) --* 

                Defines a custom response for the web request.

                 

                For information about customizing web requests and responses, see `Customizing web requests and responses in WAF <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-custom-request-response.html>`__ in the *WAF Developer Guide*.

                
                

                - **ResponseCode** *(integer) --* 

                  The HTTP status code to return to the client.

                   

                  For a list of status codes that you can use in your custom responses, see `Supported status codes for custom response <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/customizing-the-response-status-codes.html>`__ in the *WAF Developer Guide*.

                  
                

                - **CustomResponseBodyKey** *(string) --* 

                  References the response body that you want WAF to return to the web request client. You can define a custom response for a rule action or a default web ACL action that is set to block. To do this, you first define the response body key and value in the ``CustomResponseBodies`` setting for the  WebACL or  RuleGroup where you want to use it. Then, in the rule action or web ACL default action ``BlockAction`` setting, you reference the response body using this key.

                  
                

                - **ResponseHeaders** *(list) --* 

                  The HTTP headers to use in the response. You can specify any header name except for ``content-type``. Duplicate header names are not allowed.

                   

                  For information about the limits on count and size for custom request and response settings, see `WAF quotas <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/limits.html>`__ in the *WAF Developer Guide*.

                    - **Name** *(string) --* 

                      The name of the custom header.

                       

                      For custom request header insertion, when WAF inserts the header into the request, it prefixes this name ``x-amzn-waf-``, to avoid confusion with the headers that are already in the request. For example, for the header name ``sample``, WAF inserts the header ``x-amzn-waf-sample``.

                  For information about the limits on count and size for custom request and response settings, see `WAF quotas <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/limits.html>`__ in the *WAF Developer Guide*.

                  
                  

                  - *(dict) --* 

                    A custom header for custom request and response handling. This is used in  CustomResponse and  CustomRequestHandling.

                    
                    

                    - **Name** *(string) --* 

                      The name of the custom header.

                       

                      For custom request header insertion, when WAF inserts the header into the request, it prefixes this name ``x-amzn-waf-``, to avoid confusion with the headers that are already in the request. For example, for the header name ``sample``, WAF inserts the header ``x-amzn-waf-sample``.

                      
                    

                    - **Value** *(string) --* 

                      The value of the custom header.

                      
                
              
            
          
        
      
    
      

      - **LabelNamespace** *(string) --* 

        The label namespace prefix for this rule group. All labels added by rules in this rule group have this prefix.

         

        
        * The syntax for the label namespace prefix for a managed rule group is the following: ``awswaf:managed:<vendor>:<rule group name>``:
         
        * When a rule with a label matches a web request, WAF adds the fully qualified label to the request. A fully qualified label is made up of the label namespace from the rule group or web ACL where the rule is defined and the label from the rule, separated by a colon: ``<label namespace>:<label from rule>``
        

        
      

      - **AvailableLabels** *(list) --* 

        The labels that one or more rules in this rule group add to matching web requests. These labels are defined in the ``RuleLabels`` for a  Rule.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          List of labels used by one or more of the rules of a  RuleGroup. This summary object is used for the following rule group lists:

           

          
          * ``AvailableLabels`` - Labels that rules add to matching requests. These labels are defined in the ``RuleLabels`` for a  Rule.
           
          * ``ConsumedLabels`` - Labels that rules match against. These labels are defined in a ``LabelMatchStatement`` specification, in the  Statement definition of a rule.
          

          
          

          - **Name** *(string) --* 

            An individual label specification.

            
      
    
      

      - **ConsumedLabels** *(list) --* 

        The labels that one or more rules in this rule group match against in label match statements. These labels are defined in a ``LabelMatchStatement`` specification, in the  Statement definition of a rule.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          List of labels used by one or more of the rules of a  RuleGroup. This summary object is used for the following rule group lists:

           

          
          * ``AvailableLabels`` - Labels that rules add to matching requests. These labels are defined in the ``RuleLabels`` for a  Rule.
           
          * ``ConsumedLabels`` - Labels that rules match against. These labels are defined in a ``LabelMatchStatement`` specification, in the  Statement definition of a rule.
          

          
          

          - **Name** *(string) --*
