.. py:method:: WAFV2.Client.list_managed_rule_sets(**kwargs)

  

  Retrieves the managed rule sets that you own.

   

  .. note::

    

    This is intended for use only by vendors of managed rule sets. Vendors are Amazon Web Services and Amazon Web Services Marketplace sellers.

     

    Vendors, you can use the managed rule set APIs to provide controlled rollout of your versioned managed rule group offerings for your customers. The APIs are ``ListManagedRuleSets``, ``GetManagedRuleSet``, ``PutManagedRuleSetVersions``, and ``UpdateManagedRuleSetVersionExpiryDate``.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_managed_rule_sets(
        Scope='CLOUDFRONT'|'REGIONAL',
        NextMarker='string',
        Limit=123
    )
    
  :type Scope: string
  :param Scope: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies whether this is for a global resource type, such as a Amazon CloudFront distribution. For an Amplify application, use ``CLOUDFRONT``.

     

    To work with CloudFront, you must also specify the Region US East (N. Virginia) as follows:

     

    
    * CLI - Specify the Region when you use the CloudFront scope: ``--scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1``.
     
    * API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.
    

    

  
  :type NextMarker: string
  :param NextMarker: 

    When you request a list of objects with a ``Limit`` setting, if the number of objects that are still available for retrieval exceeds the limit, WAF returns a ``NextMarker`` value in the response. To retrieve the next batch of objects, provide the marker from the prior call in your next request.

    

  
  :type Limit: integer
  :param Limit: 

    The maximum number of objects that you want WAF to return for this request. If more objects are available, in the response, WAF provides a ``NextMarker`` value that you can use in a subsequent call to get the next batch of objects.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **NextMarker** *(string) --* 

        When you request a list of objects with a ``Limit`` setting, if the number of objects that are still available for retrieval exceeds the limit, WAF returns a ``NextMarker`` value in the response. To retrieve the next batch of objects, provide the marker from the prior call in your next request.

        
      

      - **ManagedRuleSets** *(list) --* 

        Your managed rule sets. If you specified a ``Limit`` in your request, this might not be the full list.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          High-level information for a managed rule set.

           

          .. note::

            

            This is intended for use only by vendors of managed rule sets. Vendors are Amazon Web Services and Amazon Web Services Marketplace sellers.

             

            Vendors, you can use the managed rule set APIs to provide controlled rollout of your versioned managed rule group offerings for your customers. The APIs are ``ListManagedRuleSets``, ``GetManagedRuleSet``, ``PutManagedRuleSetVersions``, and ``UpdateManagedRuleSetVersionExpiryDate``.

            

          
          

          - **Name** *(string) --* 

            The name of the managed rule set. You use this, along with the rule set ID, to identify the rule set.

             

            This name is assigned to the corresponding managed rule group, which your customers can access and use.

            
          

          - **Id** *(string) --* 

            A unique identifier for the managed rule set. The ID is returned in the responses to commands like ``list``. You provide it to operations like ``get`` and ``update``.

            
          

          - **Description** *(string) --* 

            A description of the set that helps with identification.

            
          

          - **LockToken** *(string) --* 

            A token used for optimistic locking. WAF returns a token to your ``get`` and ``list`` requests, to mark the state of the entity at the time of the request. To make changes to the entity associated with the token, you provide the token to operations like ``update`` and ``delete``. WAF uses the token to ensure that no changes have been made to the entity since you last retrieved it. If a change has been made, the update fails with a ``WAFOptimisticLockException``. If this happens, perform another ``get``, and use the new token returned by that operation.

            
          

          - **ARN** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the entity.

            
          

          - **LabelNamespace** *(string) --* 

            The label namespace prefix for the managed rule groups that are offered to customers from this managed rule set. All labels that are added by rules in the managed rule group have this prefix.

             

            
            * The syntax for the label namespace prefix for a managed rule group is the following: ``awswaf:managed:<vendor>:<rule group name>``:
             
            * When a rule with a label matches a web request, WAF adds the fully qualified label to the request. A fully qualified label is made up of the label namespace from the rule group or web ACL where the rule is defined and the label from the rule, separated by a colon: ``<label namespace>:<label from rule>``
