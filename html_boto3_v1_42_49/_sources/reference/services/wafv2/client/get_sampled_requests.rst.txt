.. py:method:: WAFV2.Client.get_sampled_requests(**kwargs)

  

  Gets detailed information about a specified number of requests--a sample--that WAF randomly selects from among the first 5,000 requests that your Amazon Web Services resource received during a time range that you choose. You can specify a sample size of up to 500 requests, and you can specify any time range in the previous three hours.

   

  ``GetSampledRequests`` returns a time range, which is usually the time range that you specified. However, if your resource (such as a CloudFront distribution) received 5,000 requests before the specified time range elapsed, ``GetSampledRequests`` returns an updated time range. This new time range indicates the actual period during which WAF selected the requests in the sample.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.get_sampled_requests(
        WebAclArn='string',
        RuleMetricName='string',
        Scope='CLOUDFRONT'|'REGIONAL',
        TimeWindow={
            'StartTime': datetime(2015, 1, 1),
            'EndTime': datetime(2015, 1, 1)
        },
        MaxItems=123
    )
    
  :type WebAclArn: string
  :param WebAclArn: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The Amazon resource name (ARN) of the ``WebACL`` for which you want a sample of requests.

    

  
  :type RuleMetricName: string
  :param RuleMetricName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The metric name assigned to the ``Rule`` or ``RuleGroup`` dimension for which you want a sample of requests.

    

  
  :type Scope: string
  :param Scope: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies whether this is for a global resource type, such as a Amazon CloudFront distribution. For an Amplify application, use ``CLOUDFRONT``.

     

    To work with CloudFront, you must also specify the Region US East (N. Virginia) as follows:

     

    
    * CLI - Specify the Region when you use the CloudFront scope: ``--scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1``.
     
    * API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.
    

    

  
  :type TimeWindow: dict
  :param TimeWindow: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The start date and time and the end date and time of the range for which you want ``GetSampledRequests`` to return a sample of requests. You must specify the times in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) format. UTC format includes the special designator, ``Z``. For example, ``"2016-09-27T14:50Z"``. You can specify any time range in the previous three hours. If you specify a start time that's earlier than three hours ago, WAF sets it to three hours ago.

    

  
    - **StartTime** *(datetime) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The beginning of the time range from which you want ``GetSampledRequests`` to return a sample of the requests that your Amazon Web Services resource received. You must specify the times in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) format. UTC format includes the special designator, ``Z``. For example, ``"2016-09-27T14:50Z"``. You can specify any time range in the previous three hours.

      

    
    - **EndTime** *(datetime) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The end of the time range from which you want ``GetSampledRequests`` to return a sample of the requests that your Amazon Web Services resource received. You must specify the times in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) format. UTC format includes the special designator, ``Z``. For example, ``"2016-09-27T14:50Z"``. You can specify any time range in the previous three hours.

      

    
  
  :type MaxItems: integer
  :param MaxItems: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The number of requests that you want WAF to return from among the first 5,000 requests that your Amazon Web Services resource received during the time range. If your resource received fewer requests than the value of ``MaxItems``, ``GetSampledRequests`` returns information about all of them.

          - **Weight** *(integer) --* 

            A value that indicates how one result in the response relates proportionally to other results in the response. For example, a result that has a weight of ``2`` represents roughly twice as many web requests as a result that has a weight of ``1``.

            
          

          - **Timestamp** *(datetime) --* 

            The time at which WAF received the request from your Amazon Web Services resource, in Unix time format (in seconds).

          - **Labels** *(list) --* 

            Labels applied to the web request by matching rules. WAF applies fully qualified labels to matching web requests. A fully qualified label is the concatenation of a label namespace and a rule label. The rule's rule group or web ACL defines the label namespace.

             

            For example, ``awswaf:111122223333:myRuleGroup:testRules:testNS1:testNS2:labelNameA`` or ``awswaf:managed:aws:managed-rule-set:header:encoding:utf8``.

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

              A single label container. This is used as an element of a label array in multiple contexts, for example, in ``RuleLabels`` inside a  Rule and in ``Labels`` inside a  SampledHTTPRequest.

              
              

              - **Name** *(string) --* 

                The label string.

          - **ChallengeResponse** *(dict) --* 

            The ``Challenge`` response for the request.

            
            

            - **ResponseCode** *(integer) --* 

              The HTTP response code indicating the status of the challenge token in the web request. If the token is missing, invalid, or expired, this code is ``202 Request Accepted``.

              
            

            - **SolveTimestamp** *(integer) --* 

              The time that the challenge was last solved for the supplied token.

              
            

            - **FailureReason** *(string) --* 

              The reason for failure, populated when the evaluation of the token fails.

              
        
          

          - **OverriddenAction** *(string) --* 

            Used only for rule group rules that have a rule action override in place in the web ACL. This is the action that the rule group rule is configured for, and not the action that was applied to the request. The action that WAF applied is the ``Action`` value.

            
      
    
      

      - **PopulationSize** *(integer) --* 

        The total number of requests from which ``GetSampledRequests`` got a sample of ``MaxItems`` requests. If ``PopulationSize`` is less than ``MaxItems``, the sample includes every request that your Amazon Web Services resource received during the specified time range.

        
      

      - **TimeWindow** *(dict) --* 

        Usually, ``TimeWindow`` is the time range that you specified in the ``GetSampledRequests`` request. However, if your Amazon Web Services resource received more than 5,000 requests during the time range that you specified in the request, ``GetSampledRequests`` returns the time range for the first 5,000 requests. Times are in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) format.

        
        

        - **StartTime** *(datetime) --* 

          The beginning of the time range from which you want ``GetSampledRequests`` to return a sample of the requests that your Amazon Web Services resource received. You must specify the times in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) format. UTC format includes the special designator, ``Z``. For example, ``"2016-09-27T14:50Z"``. You can specify any time range in the previous three hours.

          
        

        - **EndTime** *(datetime) --* 

          The end of the time range from which you want ``GetSampledRequests`` to return a sample of the requests that your Amazon Web Services resource received. You must specify the times in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) format. UTC format includes the special designator, ``Z``. For example, ``"2016-09-27T14:50Z"``. You can specify any time range in the previous three hours.
