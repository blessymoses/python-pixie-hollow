.. py:method:: BedrockAgentCoreControl.Client.list_policies(**kwargs)

  

  Retrieves a list of policies within the AgentCore Policy engine. This operation supports pagination and filtering to help administrators manage and discover policies across policy engines. Results can be filtered by policy engine or resource associations.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_policies(
        nextToken='string',
        maxResults=123,
        policyEngineId='string',
        targetResourceScope='string'
    )
    
  :type nextToken: string
  :param nextToken: 

    A pagination token returned from a previous `ListPolicies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore-control/latest/APIReference/API_ListPolicies.html>`__ call. Use this token to retrieve the next page of results when the response is paginated.

    

  
  :type maxResults: integer
  :param maxResults: 

    The maximum number of policies to return in a single response. If not specified, the default is 10 policies per page, with a maximum of 100 per page.

    

  
  :type policyEngineId: string
  :param policyEngineId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The identifier of the policy engine whose policies to retrieve.

    

  
  :type targetResourceScope: string
  :param targetResourceScope: 

    Optional filter to list policies that apply to a specific resource scope or resource type. This helps narrow down policy results to those relevant for particular Amazon Web Services resources, agent tools, or operational contexts within the policy engine ecosystem.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **policies** *(list) --* 

        An array of policy objects that match the specified criteria. Each policy object contains the policy metadata, status, and key identifiers for further operations.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          Represents a complete policy resource within the AgentCore Policy system. Policies are ARN-able resources that contain Cedar policy statements and associated metadata for controlling agent behavior and access decisions. Each policy belongs to a policy engine and defines fine-grained authorization rules that are evaluated in real-time as agents interact with tools through Gateway. Policies use the Cedar policy language to specify who (principals based on OAuth claims like username, role, or scope) can perform what actions (tool calls) on which resources (Gateways), with optional conditions for attribute-based access control. Multiple policies can apply to a single request, with Cedar's forbid-wins semantics ensuring that security restrictions are never accidentally overridden.

          
          

          - **policyId** *(string) --* 

            The unique identifier for the policy. This system-generated identifier consists of the user name plus a 10-character generated suffix and serves as the primary key for policy operations.

            
          

          - **name** *(string) --* 

            The customer-assigned immutable name for the policy. This human-readable identifier must be unique within the account and cannot exceed 48 characters.

            
          

          - **policyEngineId** *(string) --* 

            The identifier of the policy engine that manages this policy. This establishes the policy engine context for policy evaluation and management.

            
          

          - **definition** *(dict) --* 

            The Cedar policy statement that defines the access control rules. This contains the actual policy logic used for agent behavior control and access decisions.

            .. note::    This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the     following top level keys will be set: ``cedar``.     If a client receives an unknown member it will     set ``SDK_UNKNOWN_MEMBER`` as the top level key,     which maps to the name or tag of the unknown     member. The structure of ``SDK_UNKNOWN_MEMBER`` is     as follows::

                        'SDK_UNKNOWN_MEMBER': {'name': 'UnknownMemberName'}


          
            

            - **cedar** *(dict) --* 

              The Cedar policy definition within the policy definition structure. This contains the Cedar policy statement that defines the authorization logic using Cedar's human-readable, analyzable policy language. Cedar policies specify principals (who can access), actions (what operations are allowed), resources (what can be accessed), and optional conditions for fine-grained control. Cedar provides a formal policy language designed for authorization with deterministic evaluation, making policies testable, reviewable, and auditable. All Cedar policies follow a default-deny model where actions are denied unless explicitly permitted, and forbid policies always override permit policies.

              
              

              - **statement** *(string) --* 

                The Cedar policy statement that defines the authorization logic. This statement follows Cedar syntax and specifies principals, actions, resources, and conditions that determine when access should be allowed or denied.

                
          
        
          

          - **description** *(string) --* 

            A human-readable description of the policy's purpose and functionality. Limited to 4,096 characters, this helps administrators understand and manage the policy.

            
          

          - **createdAt** *(datetime) --* 

            The timestamp when the policy was originally created. This is automatically set by the service and used for auditing and lifecycle management.

            
          

          - **updatedAt** *(datetime) --* 

            The timestamp when the policy was last modified. This tracks the most recent changes to the policy configuration or metadata.

            
          

          - **policyArn** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the policy. This globally unique identifier can be used for cross-service references and IAM policy statements.

            
          

          - **status** *(string) --* 

            The current status of the policy.

            
          

          - **statusReasons** *(list) --* 

            Additional information about the policy status. This provides details about any failures or the current state of the policy lifecycle.

            
            

            - *(string) --* 
        
      
    
      

      - **nextToken** *(string) --* 

        A pagination token that can be used in subsequent ListPolicies calls to retrieve additional results. This token is only present when there are more results available.
