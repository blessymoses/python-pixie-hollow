.. py:method:: SupportApp.Client.register_slack_workspace_for_organization(**kwargs)

  

  Registers a Slack workspace for your Amazon Web Services account. To call this API, your account must be part of an organization in Organizations.

   

  If you're the *management account* and you want to register Slack workspaces for your organization, you must complete the following tasks:

   

   
  * Sign in to the `Amazon Web Services Support Center <https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/app>`__ and authorize the Slack workspaces where you want your organization to have access to. See `Authorize a Slack workspace <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/authorize-slack-workspace.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services Support User Guide*.
   
  * Call the ``RegisterSlackWorkspaceForOrganization`` API to authorize each Slack workspace for the organization.
   

   

  After the management account authorizes the Slack workspace, member accounts can call this API to authorize the same Slack workspace for their individual accounts. Member accounts don't need to authorize the Slack workspace manually through the `Amazon Web Services Support Center <https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/app>`__.

   

  To use the Amazon Web Services Support App, each account must then complete the following tasks:

   

  
  * Create an Identity and Access Management (IAM) role with the required permission. For more information, see `Managing access to the Amazon Web Services Support App <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/support-app-permissions.html>`__.
   
  * Configure a Slack channel to use the Amazon Web Services Support App for support cases for that account. For more information, see `Configuring a Slack channel <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/add-your-slack-channel.html>`__.
