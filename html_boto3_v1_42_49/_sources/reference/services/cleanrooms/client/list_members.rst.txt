    )
    
  :type collaborationIdentifier: string
  :param collaborationIdentifier: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The identifier of the collaboration in which the members are listed.

    

  
  :type nextToken: string
  :param nextToken: 

    The pagination token that's used to fetch the next set of results.

    

  
  :type maxResults: integer
  :param maxResults: 

    The maximum number of results that are returned for an API request call. The service chooses a default number if you don't set one. The service might return a `nextToken` even if the `maxResults` value has not been met.
