  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_memberships(
        nextToken='string',
        maxResults=123,
        status='ACTIVE'|'REMOVED'|'COLLABORATION_DELETED'
    )
    
  :type nextToken: string
  :param nextToken: 

    The pagination token that's used to fetch the next set of results.

    

  
  :type maxResults: integer
  :param maxResults: 

    The maximum number of results that are returned for an API request call. The service chooses a default number if you don't set one. The service might return a `nextToken` even if the `maxResults` value has not been met.

    

  
  :type status: string
  :param status: 

    A filter which will return only memberships in the specified status.
