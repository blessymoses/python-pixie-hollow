    **Response Syntax**

    
    ::

      {

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 

      The result of a ``BuildSuggester`` request. Contains a list of the fields used for suggestions.

      
      

      - **FieldNames** *(list) --* 

        A list of field names.

        
        

        - *(string) --* 

          A string that represents the name of an index field. CloudSearch supports regular index fields as well as dynamic fields. A dynamic field's name defines a pattern that begins or ends with a wildcard. Any document fields that don't map to a regular index field but do match a dynamic field's pattern are configured with the dynamic field's indexing options.

           

          Regular field names begin with a letter and can contain the following characters: a-z (lowercase), 0-9, and _ (underscore). Dynamic field names must begin or end with a wildcard (*). The wildcard can also be the only character in a dynamic field name. Multiple wildcards, and wildcards embedded within a string are not supported.

           

          The name ``score`` is reserved and cannot be used as a field name. To reference a document's ID, you can use the name ``_id``.
