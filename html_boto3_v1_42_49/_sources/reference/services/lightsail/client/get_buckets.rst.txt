    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **buckets** *(list) --* 

        An array of objects that describe buckets.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          Describes an Amazon Lightsail bucket.

          
          

          - **resourceType** *(string) --* 

            The Lightsail resource type of the bucket.

            
          

          - **accessRules** *(dict) --* 

            An object that describes the access rules of the bucket.

            
            

            - **getObject** *(string) --* 

              Specifies the anonymous access to all objects in a bucket.

               

              The following options can be specified:

               

              
              * ``public`` - Sets all objects in the bucket to public (read-only), making them readable by anyone in the world. If the ``getObject`` value is set to ``public``, then all objects in the bucket default to public regardless of the ``allowPublicOverrides`` value.
               
              * ``private`` - Sets all objects in the bucket to private, making them readable only by you or anyone you give access to. If the ``getObject`` value is set to ``private``, and the ``allowPublicOverrides`` value is set to ``true``, then all objects in the bucket default to private unless they are configured with a ``public-read`` ACL. Individual objects with a ``public-read`` ACL are readable by anyone in the world.
              

              
            

            - **allowPublicOverrides** *(boolean) --*

                  * ``HEAD`` - Retrieves only the headers from the server without the actual content, useful for checking if a resource exists.
                  

                  
                  

                  - *(string) --* 
              
                

                - **allowedOrigins** *(list) --* 

                  One or more origins you want customers to be able to access the bucket from. Each CORS rule must identify at least one origin and one method.

                  
                  

                  - *(string) --* 
              
                

                - **allowedHeaders** *(list) --* 

                  Headers that are specified in the ``Access-Control-Request-Headers`` header. These headers are allowed in a preflight ``OPTIONS`` request. In response to any preflight ``OPTIONS`` request, Amazon S3 returns any requested headers that are allowed.

                  
                  

                  - *(string) --* 
              
                

                - **exposeHeaders** *(list) --* 

                  One or more headers in the response that you want customers to be able to access from their applications (for example, from a JavaScript ``XMLHttpRequest`` object).

                  
                  

                  - *(string) --* 
              
                

                - **maxAgeSeconds** *(integer) --* 

                  The time in seconds that your browser is to cache the preflight response for the specified resource. A CORS rule can have only one ``maxAgeSeconds`` element.

                  
            
          
        
      
    
      

      - **nextPageToken** *(string) --* 

        The token to advance to the next page of results from your request.

         

        A next page token is not returned if there are no more results to display.

         

        To get the next page of results, perform another ``GetBuckets`` request and specify the next page token using the ``pageToken`` parameter.

        
      

      - **accountLevelBpaSync** *(dict) --* 

        An object that describes the synchronization status of the Amazon S3 account-level block public access feature for your Lightsail buckets.

         

        For more information about this feature and how it affects Lightsail buckets, see `Block public access for buckets in Amazon Lightsail <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lightsail/latest/userguide/amazon-lightsail-block-public-access-for-buckets>`__.

        
        

        - **status** *(string) --* 

          The status of the account-level BPA synchronization.

           

          The following statuses are possible:

           

          
          * ``InSync`` - Account-level BPA is synchronized. The Amazon S3 account-level BPA configuration applies to your Lightsail buckets.
           
          * ``NeverSynced`` - Synchronization has not yet happened. The Amazon S3 account-level BPA configuration does not apply to your Lightsail buckets.
           
          * ``Failed`` - Synchronization failed. The Amazon S3 account-level BPA configuration does not apply to your Lightsail buckets.
           
          * ``Defaulted`` - Synchronization failed and account-level BPA for your Lightsail buckets is defaulted to *active*.
          

           

          .. note::

            

            You might need to complete further actions if the status is ``Failed`` or ``Defaulted``. The ``message`` parameter provides more information for those statuses.

            

          
        

        - **lastSyncedAt** *(datetime) --* 

          The timestamp of when the account-level BPA configuration was last synchronized. This value is null when the account-level BPA configuration has not been synchronized.

          
        

        - **message** *(string) --* 

          A message that provides a reason for a ``Failed`` or ``Defaulted`` synchronization status.

           

          The following messages are possible:

           

          
          * ``SYNC_ON_HOLD`` - The synchronization has not yet happened. This status message occurs immediately after you create your first Lightsail bucket. This status message should change after the first synchronization happens, approximately 1 hour after the first bucket is created.
           
          * ``DEFAULTED_FOR_SLR_MISSING`` - The synchronization failed because the required service-linked role is missing from your Amazon Web Services account. The account-level BPA configuration for your Lightsail buckets is defaulted to *active* until the synchronization can occur. This means that all your buckets are private and not publicly accessible. For more information about how to create the required service-linked role to allow synchronization, see `Using Service-Linked Roles for Amazon Lightsail <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lightsail/latest/userguide/amazon-lightsail-using-service-linked-roles>`__ in the *Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide*.
           
          * ``DEFAULTED_FOR_SLR_MISSING_ON_HOLD`` - The synchronization failed because the required service-linked role is missing from your Amazon Web Services account. Account-level BPA is not yet configured for your Lightsail buckets. Therefore, only the bucket access permissions and individual object access permissions apply to your Lightsail buckets. For more information about how to create the required service-linked role to allow synchronization, see `Using Service-Linked Roles for Amazon Lightsail <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lightsail/latest/userguide/amazon-lightsail-using-service-linked-roles>`__ in the *Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide*.
           
          * ``Unknown`` - The reason that synchronization failed is unknown. Contact Amazon Web Services Support for more information.
          

          
        

        - **bpaImpactsLightsail** *(boolean) --* 

          A Boolean value that indicates whether account-level block public access is affecting your Lightsail buckets.
