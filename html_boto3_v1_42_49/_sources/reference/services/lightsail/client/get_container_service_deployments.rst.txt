.. py:method:: Lightsail.Client.get_container_service_deployments(**kwargs)

  

  Returns the deployments for your Amazon Lightsail container service

   

  A deployment specifies the settings, such as the ports and launch command, of containers that are deployed to your container service.

   

  The deployments are ordered by version in ascending order. The newest version is listed at the top of the response.

   

  .. note::

    

    A set number of deployments are kept before the oldest one is replaced with the newest one. For more information, see `Amazon Lightsail endpoints and quotas <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/lightsail.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **deployments** *(list) --* 

        An array of objects that describe deployments for a container service.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          Describes a container deployment configuration of an Amazon Lightsail container service.

           

          A deployment specifies the settings, such as the ports and launch command, of containers that are deployed to your container service.

          
          

          - **version** *(integer) --* 

            The version number of the deployment.

            
          

          - **state** *(string) --* 

            The state of the deployment.

             

            A deployment can be in one of the following states:

             

            
            * ``ACTIVATING`` - The deployment is being created.
             
            * ``ACTIVE`` - The deployment was successfully created, and it's currently running on the container service. The container service can have only one deployment in an active state at a time.
             
            * ``INACTIVE`` - The deployment was previously successfully created, but it is not currently running on the container service.
             
            * ``FAILED`` - The deployment failed. Use the ``GetContainerLog`` action to view the log events for the containers in the deployment to try to determine the reason for the failure.
            

            
          

          - **containers** *(dict) --* 

            An object that describes the configuration for the containers of the deployment.

            
            

            - *(string) --* 
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                Describes the settings of a container that will be launched, or that is launched, to an Amazon Lightsail container service.

                
                

                - **image** *(string) --* 

                  The name of the image used for the container.

                   

                  Container images sourced from your Lightsail container service, that are registered and stored on your service, start with a colon ( ``:``). For example, if your container service name is ``container-service-1``, the container image label is ``mystaticsite``, and you want to use the third ( ``3``) version of the registered container image, then you should specify ``:container-service-1.mystaticsite.3``. To use the latest version of a container image, specify ``latest`` instead of a version number (for example, ``:container-service-1.mystaticsite.latest``). Lightsail will automatically use the highest numbered version of the registered container image.

                   

                  Container images sourced from a public registry like Docker Hub don't start with a colon. For example, ``nginx:latest`` or ``nginx``.

                  
                

                - **command** *(list) --* 

                  The launch command for the container.

                - **environment** *(dict) --* 

                  The environment variables of the container.

              - **intervalSeconds** *(integer) --* 

                The approximate interval, in seconds, between health checks of an individual container. You can specify between 5 and 300 seconds. The default value is ``5``.
