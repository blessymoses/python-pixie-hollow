.. py:method:: Lightsail.Client.get_certificates(**kwargs)

  

  Returns information about one or more Amazon Lightsail SSL/TLS certificates.

   

  .. note::

    

    To get a summary of a certificate, omit ``includeCertificateDetails`` from your request. The response will include only the certificate Amazon Resource Name (ARN), certificate name, domain name, and tags.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.get_certificates(
        certificateStatuses=[
            'PENDING_VALIDATION'|'ISSUED'|'INACTIVE'|'EXPIRED'|'VALIDATION_TIMED_OUT'|'REVOKED'|'FAILED',
        ],
        includeCertificateDetails=True|False,
        certificateName='string',
        pageToken='string'
    )
    
  :type certificateStatuses: list
  :param certificateStatuses: 

    The status of the certificates for which to return information.

     

    For example, specify ``ISSUED`` to return only certificates with an ``ISSUED`` status.

     

    When omitted, the response includes all of your certificates in the Amazon Web Services Region where the request is made, regardless of their current status.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type includeCertificateDetails: boolean
  :param includeCertificateDetails: 

    Indicates whether to include detailed information about the certificates in the response.

     

    When omitted, the response includes only the certificate names, Amazon Resource Names (ARNs), domain names, and tags.

    

  
  :type certificateName: string
  :param certificateName: 

    The name for the certificate for which to return information.

     

    When omitted, the response includes all of your certificates in the Amazon Web Services Region where the request is made.

    

  
  :type pageToken: string
  :param pageToken: 

    The token to advance to the next page of results from your request.

     

    To get a page token, perform an initial ``GetCertificates`` request. If your results are paginated, the response will return a next page token that you can specify as the page token in a subsequent request.

              The validation failure reason, if any, of the certificate.

               

              The following failure reasons are possible:

               

              
              * ``NO_AVAILABLE_CONTACTS`` - This failure applies to email validation, which is not available for Lightsail certificates.
               
              * ``ADDITIONAL_VERIFICATION_REQUIRED`` - Lightsail requires additional information to process this certificate request. This can happen as a fraud-protection measure, such as when the domain ranks within the Alexa top 1000 websites. To provide the required information, use the `Amazon Web Services Support Center <https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home>`__ to contact Amazon Web Services Support. 

              .. note::

                You cannot request a certificate for Amazon-owned domain names such as those ending in amazonaws.com, cloudfront.net, or elasticbeanstalk.com.

              
               
              * ``DOMAIN_NOT_ALLOWED`` - One or more of the domain names in the certificate request was reported as an unsafe domain by `VirusTotal <https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/url>`__. To correct the problem, search for your domain name on the `VirusTotal <https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/url>`__ website. If your domain is reported as suspicious, see `Google Help for Hacked Websites <https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/hacked>`__ to learn what you can do. If you believe that the result is a false positive, notify the organization that is reporting the domain. VirusTotal is an aggregate of several antivirus and URL scanners and cannot remove your domain from a block list itself. After you correct the problem and the VirusTotal registry has been updated, request a new certificate. If you see this error and your domain is not included in the VirusTotal list, visit the `Amazon Web Services Support Center <https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home>`__ and create a case.
               
              * ``INVALID_PUBLIC_DOMAIN`` - One or more of the domain names in the certificate request is not valid. Typically, this is because a domain name in the request is not a valid top-level domain. Try to request a certificate again, correcting any spelling errors or typos that were in the failed request, and ensure that all domain names in the request are for valid top-level domains. For example, you cannot request a certificate for ``example.invalidpublicdomain`` because ``invalidpublicdomain`` is not a valid top-level domain.
               
              * ``OTHER`` - Typically, this failure occurs when there is a typographical error in one or more of the domain names in the certificate request. Try to request a certificate again, correcting any spelling errors or typos that were in the failed request.
