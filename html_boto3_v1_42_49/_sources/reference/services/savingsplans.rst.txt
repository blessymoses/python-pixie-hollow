.. py:class:: SavingsPlans.Client

  A low-level client representing AWS Savings Plans (avingsPlans)
  

  Savings Plans are a pricing model that offer significant savings on Amazon Web Services usage (for example, on Amazon EC2 instances). You commit to a consistent amount of usage per hour, in the specified currency, for a term of one or three years, and receive a lower price for that usage. For more information, see the `Amazon Web Services Savings Plans User Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/savingsplans/latest/userguide/>`__.
