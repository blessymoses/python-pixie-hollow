.. py:method:: ECS.Client.tag_resource(**kwargs)

  

  Associates the specified tags to a resource with the specified ``resourceArn``. If existing tags on a resource aren't specified in the request parameters, they aren't changed. When a resource is deleted, the tags that are associated with that resource are deleted as well.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.tag_resource(
        resourceArn='string',
        tags=[
            {
                'key': 'string',
                'value': 'string'
            },
        ]
    )
    
  :type resourceArn: string
  :param resourceArn: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource to add tags to. Currently, the supported resources are Amazon ECS capacity providers, tasks, services, task definitions, clusters, and container instances.

     

    In order to tag a service that has the following ARN format, you need to migrate the service to the long ARN. For more information, see `Migrate an Amazon ECS short service ARN to a long ARN <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-arn-migration.html>`__ in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.

     

    ``arn:aws:ecs:region:aws_account_id:service/service-name``

     

    After the migration is complete, the service has the long ARN format, as shown below. Use this ARN to tag the service.

     

    ``arn:aws:ecs:region:aws_account_id:service/cluster-name/service-name``

     

    If you try to tag a service with a short ARN, you receive an ``InvalidParameterException`` error.

    

  
  :type tags: list
  :param tags: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The tags to add to the resource. A tag is an array of key-value pairs.

     

    The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

     

    
    * Maximum number of tags per resource - 50
     
    * For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value.
     
    * Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8
     
    * Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8
     
    * If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.
     
    * Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.
     
    * Do not use ``aws:``, ``AWS:``, or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is reserved for Amazon Web Services use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys or values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do not count against your tags per resource limit.
    

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      The metadata that you apply to a resource to help you categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value. You define them.

      - **key** *(string) --* 

        One part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A ``key`` is a general label that acts like a category for more specific tag values.

        

      
      - **value** *(string) --* 

        The optional part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A ``value`` acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

  **Examples**

  This example tags the 'dev' cluster with key 'team' and value 'dev'.
  ::

    response = client.tag_resource(
        resourceArn='arn:aws:ecs:region:aws_account_id:cluster/dev',
        tags=[
            {
                'key': 'team',
                'value': 'dev',
            },
        ],
    )
    
    print(response)

  
  Expected Output:
  ::

    {
        'ResponseMetadata': {
            '...': '...',
        },
    }
