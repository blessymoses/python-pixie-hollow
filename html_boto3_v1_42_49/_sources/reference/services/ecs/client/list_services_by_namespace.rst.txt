.. py:method:: ECS.Client.list_services_by_namespace(**kwargs)

  

  This operation lists all of the services that are associated with a Cloud Map namespace. This list might include services in different clusters. In contrast, ``ListServices`` can only list services in one cluster at a time. If you need to filter the list of services in a single cluster by various parameters, use ``ListServices``. For more information, see `Service Connect <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-connect.html>`__ in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_services_by_namespace(
        namespace='string',
        nextToken='string',
        maxResults=123
    )
    
  :type namespace: string
  :param namespace: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The namespace name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Cloud Map namespace to list the services in.

     

    Tasks that run in a namespace can use short names to connect to services in the namespace. Tasks can connect to services across all of the clusters in the namespace. Tasks connect through a managed proxy container that collects logs and metrics for increased visibility. Only the tasks that Amazon ECS services create are supported with Service Connect. For more information, see `Service Connect <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-connect.html>`__ in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.

    

  
  :type nextToken: string
  :param nextToken: 

    The ``nextToken`` value that's returned from a ``ListServicesByNamespace`` request. It indicates that more results are available to fulfill the request and further calls are needed. If ``maxResults`` is returned, it is possible the number of results is less than ``maxResults``.

    

  
  :type maxResults: integer
  :param maxResults: 

    The maximum number of service results that ``ListServicesByNamespace`` returns in paginated output. When this parameter is used, ``ListServicesByNamespace`` only returns ``maxResults`` results in a single page along with a ``nextToken`` response element. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another ``ListServicesByNamespace`` request with the returned ``nextToken`` value. This value can be between 1 and 100. If this parameter isn't used, then ``ListServicesByNamespace`` returns up to 10 results and a ``nextToken`` value if applicable.

    **Response Syntax**

    
    ::

      {
          'serviceArns': [
              'string',
          ],
          'nextToken': 'string'
      }
      
    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **serviceArns** *(list) --* 

        The list of full ARN entries for each service that's associated with the specified namespace.

        
        

        - *(string) --* 
    
      

      - **nextToken** *(string) --* 

        The ``nextToken`` value to include in a future ``ListServicesByNamespace`` request. When the results of a ``ListServicesByNamespace`` request exceed ``maxResults``, this value can be used to retrieve the next page of results. When there are no more results to return, this value is ``null``.
