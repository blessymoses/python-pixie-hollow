.. py:method:: ECS.Client.update_container_instances_state(**kwargs)

  

  Modifies the status of an Amazon ECS container instance.

   

  Once a container instance has reached an ``ACTIVE`` state, you can change the status of a container instance to ``DRAINING`` to manually remove an instance from a cluster, for example to perform system updates, update the Docker daemon, or scale down the cluster size.

   

  .. warning::

     

    A container instance can't be changed to ``DRAINING`` until it has reached an ``ACTIVE`` status. If the instance is in any other status, an error will be received.

     

   

  When you set a container instance to ``DRAINING``, Amazon ECS prevents new tasks from being scheduled for placement on the container instance and replacement service tasks are started on other container instances in the cluster if the resources are available. Service tasks on the container instance that are in the ``PENDING`` state are stopped immediately.

   

  Service tasks on the container instance that are in the ``RUNNING`` state are stopped and replaced according to the service's deployment configuration parameters, ``minimumHealthyPercent`` and ``maximumPercent``. You can change the deployment configuration of your service using `UpdateService <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateService.html>`__.

   

  
  * If ``minimumHealthyPercent`` is below 100%, the scheduler can ignore ``desiredCount`` temporarily during task replacement. For example, ``desiredCount`` is four tasks, a minimum of 50% allows the scheduler to stop two existing tasks before starting two new tasks. If the minimum is 100%, the service scheduler can't remove existing tasks until the replacement tasks are considered healthy. Tasks for services that do not use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the ``RUNNING`` state. Tasks for services that use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the ``RUNNING`` state and are reported as healthy by the load balancer.
   
  * The ``maximumPercent`` parameter represents an upper limit on the number of running tasks during task replacement. You can use this to define the replacement batch size. For example, if ``desiredCount`` is four tasks, a maximum of 200% starts four new tasks before stopping the four tasks to be drained, provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available. If the maximum is 100%, then replacement tasks can't start until the draining tasks have stopped.
  

   

  Any ``PENDING`` or ``RUNNING`` tasks that do not belong to a service aren't affected. You must wait for them to finish or stop them manually.

   

  A container instance has completed draining when it has no more ``RUNNING`` tasks. You can verify this using `ListTasks <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_ListTasks.html>`__.

   

  When a container instance has been drained, you can set a container instance to ``ACTIVE`` status and once it has reached that status the Amazon ECS scheduler can begin scheduling tasks on the instance again.

This value represents the total amount of CPU and memory that can be allocated on this container instance to tasks. For port resource types, this parameter describes the ports that were reserved by the Amazon ECS container agent when it registered the container instance with Amazon ECS.

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

              Describes the resources available for a container instance.

              - **longValue** *(integer) --* 

                When the ``longValue`` type is set, the value of the resource must be an extended precision floating-point type.

                
              

              - **integerValue** *(integer) --* 

                When the ``integerValue`` type is set, the value of the resource must be an integer.

            If your account has opted in to the ``awsvpcTrunking`` account setting, then any newly registered container instance will transition to a ``REGISTERING`` status while the trunk elastic network interface is provisioned for the instance. If the registration fails, the instance will transition to a ``REGISTRATION_FAILED`` status. You can describe the container instance and see the reason for failure in the ``statusReason`` parameter. Once the container instance is terminated, the instance transitions to a ``DEREGISTERING`` status while the trunk elastic network interface is deprovisioned. The instance then transitions to an ``INACTIVE`` status.

             

            The ``ACTIVE`` status indicates that the container instance can accept tasks. The ``DRAINING`` indicates that new tasks aren't placed on the container instance and any service tasks running on the container instance are removed if possible. For more information, see `Container instance draining <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/container-instance-draining.html>`__ in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.

          - **agentConnected** *(boolean) --* 

            This parameter returns ``true`` if the agent is connected to Amazon ECS. An instance with an agent that may be unhealthy or stopped return ``false``. Only instances connected to an agent can accept task placement requests.

            
          

          - **runningTasksCount** *(integer) --* 

            The number of tasks on the container instance that have a desired status ( ``desiredStatus``) of ``RUNNING``.

            The number of tasks on the container instance that are in the ``PENDING`` status.

            
          

          - **agentUpdateStatus** *(string) --* 

            The status of the most recent agent update. If an update wasn't ever requested, this value is ``NULL``.

            
          

          - **attributes** *(list) --* 

            The attributes set for the container instance, either by the Amazon ECS container agent at instance registration or manually with the `PutAttributes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_PutAttributes.html>`__ operation.

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

              An attribute is a name-value pair that's associated with an Amazon ECS object. Use attributes to extend the Amazon ECS data model by adding custom metadata to your resources. For more information, see `Attributes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-placement-constraints.html#attributes>`__ in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.

              
              

              - **name** *(string) --* 

                The name of the attribute. The ``name`` must contain between 1 and 128 characters. The name may contain letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens (-), underscores (_), forward slashes (/), back slashes (\), or periods (.).

                
              

              - **value** *(string) --* 

                The value of the attribute. The ``value`` must contain between 1 and 128 characters. It can contain letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens (-), underscores (_), periods (.), at signs (@), forward slashes (/), back slashes (\), colons (:), or spaces. The value can't start or end with a space.

                
              

              - **targetType** *(string) --* 

                The type of the target to attach the attribute with. This parameter is required if you use the short form ID for a resource instead of the full ARN.

                
              

              - **targetId** *(string) --* 

                The ID of the target. You can specify the short form ID for a resource or the full Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

            * Maximum number of tags per resource - 50
             
            * For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value.
             
            * Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8
             
            * Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8
             
            * If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.
             
            * Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.
             
            * Do not use ``aws:``, ``AWS:``, or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is reserved for Amazon Web Services use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys or values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do not count against your tags per resource limit.
