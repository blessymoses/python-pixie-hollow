.. py:method:: ECS.Client.list_service_deployments(**kwargs)

  

  This operation lists all the service deployments that meet the specified filter criteria.

   

  A service deployment happens when you release a software update for the service. You route traffic from the running service revisions to the new service revison and control the number of running tasks.

   

  This API returns the values that you use for the request parameters in `DescribeServiceRevisions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeServiceRevisions.html>`__.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_service_deployments(
        service='string',
        cluster='string',
        status=[
            'PENDING'|'SUCCESSFUL'|'STOPPED'|'STOP_REQUESTED'|'IN_PROGRESS'|'ROLLBACK_REQUESTED'|'ROLLBACK_IN_PROGRESS'|'ROLLBACK_SUCCESSFUL'|'ROLLBACK_FAILED',
        ],
        createdAt={
            'before': datetime(2015, 1, 1),
            'after': datetime(2015, 1, 1)
        },
        nextToken='string',
        maxResults=123
    )
    
  :type service: string
  :param service: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ARN or name of the service

    

  
  :type cluster: string
  :param cluster: 

    The cluster that hosts the service. This can either be the cluster name or ARN. Starting April 15, 2023, Amazon Web Services will not onboard new customers to Amazon Elastic Inference (EI), and will help current customers migrate their workloads to options that offer better price and performance. If you don't specify a cluster, ``default`` is used.

    

  
  :type status: list
  :param status: 

    An optional filter you can use to narrow the results. If you do not specify a status, then all status values are included in the result.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type createdAt: dict
  :param createdAt: 

    An optional filter you can use to narrow the results by the service creation date. If you do not specify a value, the result includes all services created before the current time. The format is yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSSSSS.

    

  
    - **before** *(datetime) --* 

      Include service deployments in the result that were created before this time. The format is yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSSSSS.

      

    
    - **after** *(datetime) --* 

      Include service deployments in the result that were created after this time. The format is yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSSSSS.

      

    
  
  :type nextToken: string
  :param nextToken: 

    The ``nextToken`` value returned from a ``ListServiceDeployments`` request indicating that more results are available to fulfill the request and further calls are needed. If you provided ``maxResults``, it's possible the number of results is fewer than ``maxResults``.

    

  
  :type maxResults: integer
  :param maxResults: 

    The maximum number of service deployment results that ``ListServiceDeployments`` returned in paginated output. When this parameter is used, ``ListServiceDeployments`` only returns ``maxResults`` results in a single page along with a ``nextToken`` response element. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another ``ListServiceDeployments`` request with the returned ``nextToken`` value. This value can be between 1 and 100. If this parameter isn't used, then ``ListServiceDeployments`` returns up to 20 results and a ``nextToken`` value if applicable.
