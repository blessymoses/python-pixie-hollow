.. py:class:: LocationServiceRoutesV2.Client

  A low-level client representing Amazon Location Service Routes V2
  

  With the Amazon Location Routes API you can calculate routes and estimate travel time based on up-to-date road network and live traffic information.

   

  Calculate optimal travel routes and estimate travel times using up-to-date road network and traffic data. Key features include:

   

  
  * Point-to-point routing with estimated travel time, distance, and turn-by-turn directions
   
  * Multi-point route optimization to minimize travel time or distance
   
  * Route matrices for efficient multi-destination planning
   
  * Isoline calculations to determine reachable areas within specified time or distance thresholds
   
  * Map-matching to align GPS traces with the road network
