.. py:method:: ResourceExplorer.Client.list_indexes_for_members(**kwargs)

  

  Retrieves a list of a member's indexes in all Amazon Web Services Regions that are currently collecting resource information for Amazon Web Services Resource Explorer. Only the management account or a delegated administrator with service access enabled can invoke this API call.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_indexes_for_members(
        AccountIdList=[
            'string',
        ],
        MaxResults=123,
        NextToken='string'
    )
    
  :type AccountIdList: list
  :param AccountIdList: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The account IDs will limit the output to only indexes from these accounts.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    The maximum number of results that you want included on each page of the response. If you do not include this parameter, it defaults to a value appropriate to the operation. If additional items exist beyond those included in the current response, the ``NextToken`` response element is present and has a value (is not null). Include that value as the ``NextToken`` request parameter in the next call to the operation to get the next part of the results.

     

    .. note::

      

      An API operation can return fewer results than the maximum even when there are more results available. You should check ``NextToken`` after every operation to ensure that you receive all of the results.

      

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    The parameter for receiving additional results if you receive a ``NextToken`` response in a previous request. A ``NextToken`` response indicates that more output is available. Set this parameter to the value of the previous call's ``NextToken`` response to indicate where the output should continue from. The pagination tokens expire after 24 hours.

    ::

              {
                  'AccountId': 'string',

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **Indexes** *(list) --* 

        A structure that contains the details and status of each index.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          An index is the data store used by Amazon Web Services Resource Explorer to hold information about your Amazon Web Services resources that the service discovers.

          
          

          - **AccountId** *(string) --* 

            The account ID for the index.

            
          

          - **Region** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Web Services Region in which the index exists.

            
          

          - **Arn** *(string) --* 

            The `Amazon resource name (ARN) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html>`__ of the index.

            
          

          - **Type** *(string) --* 

            The type of index. It can be one of the following values:

             

            
            * ``LOCAL`` – The index contains information about resources from only the same Amazon Web Services Region.
             
            * ``AGGREGATOR`` – Resource Explorer replicates copies of the indexed information about resources in all other Amazon Web Services Regions to the aggregator index. This lets search results in the Region with the aggregator index to include resources from all Regions in the account where Resource Explorer is turned on.
            

            
      
    
      

      - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

        If present, indicates that more output is available than is included in the current response. Use this value in the ``NextToken`` request parameter in a subsequent call to the operation to get the next part of the output. You should repeat this until the ``NextToken`` response element comes back as ``null``. The pagination tokens expire after 24 hours.
