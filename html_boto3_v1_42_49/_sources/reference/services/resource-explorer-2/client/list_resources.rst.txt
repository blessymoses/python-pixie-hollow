.. py:method:: ResourceExplorer.Client.list_resources(**kwargs)

  

  Returns a list of resources and their details that match the specified criteria. This query must use a view. If you don’t explicitly specify a view, then Resource Explorer uses the default view for the Amazon Web Services Region in which you call this operation.

  

  See also: `AWS API Documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/resource-explorer-2-2022-07-28/ListResources>`_  


  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_resources(
        Filters={
            'FilterString': 'string'
        },
        MaxResults=123,
        ViewArn='string',
        NextToken='string'
    )
    
  :type Filters: dict
  :param Filters: 

    An array of strings that specify which resources are included in the results of queries made using this view. When you use this view in a  Search operation, the filter string is combined with the search's ``QueryString`` parameter using a logical ``AND`` operator.

     

    For information about the supported syntax, see `Search query reference for Resource Explorer <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/using-search-query-syntax.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services Resource Explorer User Guide*.

     

    .. warning::

       

      This query string in the context of this operation supports only `filter prefixes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/using-search-query-syntax.html#query-syntax-filters>`__ with optional `operators <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/using-search-query-syntax.html#query-syntax-operators>`__. It doesn't support free-form text. For example, the string ``region:us* service:ec2 -tag:stage=prod`` includes all Amazon EC2 resources in any Amazon Web Services Region that begins with the letters ``us`` and is *not* tagged with a key ``Stage`` that has the value ``prod``.

      

    

  
    - **FilterString** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The string that contains the search keywords, prefixes, and operators to control the results that can be returned by a  Search operation. For more details, see `Search query syntax <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/APIReference/about-query-syntax.html>`__.

      

    
  
  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    The maximum number of results that you want included on each page of the response. If you do not include this parameter, it defaults to a value appropriate to the operation. If additional items exist beyond those included in the current response, the ``NextToken`` response element is present and has a value (is not null). Include that value as the ``NextToken`` request parameter in the next call to the operation to get the next part of the results.

     

    .. note::

      

      An API operation can return fewer results than the maximum even when there are more results available. You should check ``NextToken`` after every operation to ensure that you receive all of the results.

      

    

  
  :type ViewArn: string
  :param ViewArn: 

    Specifies the Amazon resource name (ARN) of the view to use for the query. If you don't specify a value for this parameter, then the operation automatically uses the default view for the Amazon Web Services Region in which you called this operation. If the Region either doesn't have a default view or if you don't have permission to use the default view, then the operation fails with a 401 Unauthorized exception.

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    The parameter for receiving additional results if you receive a ``NextToken`` response in a previous request. A ``NextToken`` response indicates that more output is available. Set this parameter to the value of the previous call's ``NextToken`` response to indicate where the output should continue from. The pagination tokens expire after 24 hours.

     

    .. note::

      

      The ``ListResources`` operation does not generate a ``NextToken`` if you set ``MaxResults`` to 1000.
