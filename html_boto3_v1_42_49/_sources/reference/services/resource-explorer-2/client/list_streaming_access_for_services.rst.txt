.. py:method:: ResourceExplorer.Client.list_streaming_access_for_services(**kwargs)

  

  Returns a list of Amazon Web Services services that have been granted streaming access to your Resource Explorer data. Streaming access allows Amazon Web Services services to receive real-time updates about your resources as they are indexed by Resource Explorer.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_streaming_access_for_services(
        MaxResults=123,
        NextToken='string'
    )
    
  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    The maximum number of streaming access entries to return in the response. If there are more results available, the response includes a NextToken value that you can use in a subsequent call to get the next set of results. The value must be between 1 and 50. If you don't specify a value, the default is 50.

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    The parameter for receiving additional results if you receive a ``NextToken`` response in a previous request. A ``NextToken`` response indicates that more output is available. Set this parameter to the value of the previous call's ``NextToken`` response to indicate where the output should continue from. The pagination tokens expire after 24 hours.
