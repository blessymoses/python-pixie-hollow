.. py:method:: ResourceExplorer.Client.list_views(**kwargs)

  

  Lists the `Amazon resource names (ARNs) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html>`__ of the views available in the Amazon Web Services Region in which you call this operation.

   

  .. note::

    

    Always check the ``NextToken`` response parameter for a ``null`` value when calling a paginated operation. These operations can occasionally return an empty set of results even when there are more results available. The ``NextToken`` response parameter value is ``null`` *only* when there are no more results to display.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_views(
        NextToken='string',
        MaxResults=123
    )
    
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    The parameter for receiving additional results if you receive a ``NextToken`` response in a previous request. A ``NextToken`` response indicates that more output is available. Set this parameter to the value of the previous call's ``NextToken`` response to indicate where the output should continue from. The pagination tokens expire after 24 hours.

    

  
  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    The maximum number of results that you want included on each page of the response. If you do not include this parameter, it defaults to a value appropriate to the operation. If additional items exist beyond those included in the current response, the ``NextToken`` response element is present and has a value (is not null). Include that value as the ``NextToken`` request parameter in the next call to the operation to get the next part of the results.

     

    .. note::

      

      An API operation can return fewer results than the maximum even when there are more results available. You should check ``NextToken`` after every operation to ensure that you receive all of the results.

    **Response Syntax**

    
    ::

      {
          'Views': [
              'string',
          ],
          'NextToken': 'string'
      }
      
    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **Views** *(list) --* 

        The list of views available in the Amazon Web Services Region in which you called this operation.

        
        

        - *(string) --* 
    
      

      - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

        If present, indicates that more output is available than is included in the current response. Use this value in the ``NextToken`` request parameter in a subsequent call to the operation to get the next part of the output. You should repeat this until the ``NextToken`` response element comes back as ``null``. The pagination tokens expire after 24 hours.
