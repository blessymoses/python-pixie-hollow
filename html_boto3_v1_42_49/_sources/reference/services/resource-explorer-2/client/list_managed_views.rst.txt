.. py:method:: ResourceExplorer.Client.list_managed_views(**kwargs)

  

  Lists the Amazon resource names (ARNs) of the `Amazon Web Services-managed views <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/aws-managed-views.html>`__ available in the Amazon Web Services Region in which you call this operation.

  

  See also: `AWS API Documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/resource-explorer-2-2022-07-28/ListManagedViews>`_  


  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_managed_views(
        MaxResults=123,
        NextToken='string',
        ServicePrincipal='string'
    )
    
  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    The maximum number of results that you want included on each page of the response. If you do not include this parameter, it defaults to a value appropriate to the operation. If additional items exist beyond those included in the current response, the ``NextToken`` response element is present and has a value (is not null). Include that value as the ``NextToken`` request parameter in the next call to the operation to get the next part of the results.

     

    .. note::

      

      An API operation can return fewer results than the maximum even when there are more results available. You should check ``NextToken`` after every operation to ensure that you receive all of the results.

      

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    The parameter for receiving additional results if you receive a ``NextToken`` response in a previous request. A ``NextToken`` response indicates that more output is available. Set this parameter to the value of the previous call's ``NextToken`` response to indicate where the output should continue from. The pagination tokens expire after 24 hours.

    

  
  :type ServicePrincipal: string
  :param ServicePrincipal: 

    Specifies a service principal name. If specified, then the operation only returns the managed views that are managed by the input service.

    **Response Syntax**

    
    ::

      {
          'NextToken': 'string',
          'ManagedViews': [
              'string',
          ]

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

        If present, indicates that more output is available than is included in the current response. Use this value in the ``NextToken`` request parameter in a subsequent call to the operation to get the next part of the output. You should repeat this until the ``NextToken`` response element comes back as ``null``. The pagination tokens expire after 24 hours.

        
      

      - **ManagedViews** *(list) --* 

        The list of managed views available in the Amazon Web Services Region in which you called this operation.
