  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.update_view(
        ViewArn='string',
        IncludedProperties=[
            {
                'Name': 'string'
            },
        ],
        Filters={
            'FilterString': 'string'
        }
    )
    
  :type ViewArn: string
  :param ViewArn: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The `Amazon resource name (ARN) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html>`__ of the view that you want to modify.

    

  
  :type IncludedProperties: list
  :param IncludedProperties: 

    Specifies optional fields that you want included in search results from this view. It is a list of objects that each describe a field to include.

     

    The default is an empty list, with no optional fields included in the results.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      Information about an additional property that describes a resource, that you can optionally include in the view. This lets you view that property in search results, and filter your search results based on the value of the property.

      

    
      - **Name** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The name of the property that is included in this view.

         

        You can specify the following property names for this field:

         

        
        * ``tags``
        

        

      
    

  :type Filters: dict
  :param Filters: 

    An array of strings that specify which resources are included in the results of queries made using this view. When you use this view in a  Search operation, the filter string is combined with the search's ``QueryString`` parameter using a logical ``AND`` operator.

     

    For information about the supported syntax, see `Search query reference for Resource Explorer <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/using-search-query-syntax.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services Resource Explorer User Guide*.

     

    .. warning::

       

      This query string in the context of this operation supports only `filter prefixes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/using-search-query-syntax.html#query-syntax-filters>`__ with optional `operators <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/using-search-query-syntax.html#query-syntax-operators>`__. It doesn't support free-form text. For example, the string ``region:us* service:ec2 -tag:stage=prod`` includes all Amazon EC2 resources in any Amazon Web Services Region that begins with the letters ``us`` and is *not* tagged with a key ``Stage`` that has the value ``prod``.

      

    

  
    - **FilterString** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The string that contains the search keywords, prefixes, and operators to control the results that can be returned by a  Search operation. For more details, see `Search query syntax <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/APIReference/about-query-syntax.html>`__.
