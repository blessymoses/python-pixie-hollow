.. py:method:: ResourceExplorer.Client.create_index(**kwargs)

  

  Turns on Amazon Web Services Resource Explorer in the Amazon Web Services Region in which you called this operation by creating an index. Resource Explorer begins discovering the resources in this Region and stores the details about the resources in the index so that they can be queried by using the  Search operation. You can create only one index in a Region.

   

  .. note::

    

    This operation creates only a *local* index. To promote the local index in one Amazon Web Services Region into the aggregator index for the Amazon Web Services account, use the  UpdateIndexType operation. For more information, see `Turning on cross-Region search by creating an aggregator index <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/manage-aggregator-region.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services Resource Explorer User Guide*.

    

   

  For more details about what happens when you turn on Resource Explorer in an Amazon Web Services Region, see `Turn on Resource Explorer to index your resources in an Amazon Web Services Region <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/manage-service-activate.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services Resource Explorer User Guide*.

   

  If this is the first Amazon Web Services Region in which you've created an index for Resource Explorer, then this operation also `creates a service-linked role <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/security_iam_service-linked-roles.html>`__ in your Amazon Web Services account that allows Resource Explorer to enumerate your resources to populate the index.

   

  
  * **Action**: ``resource-explorer-2:CreateIndex`` **Resource**: The ARN of the index (as it will exist after the operation completes) in the Amazon Web Services Region and account in which you're trying to create the index. Use the wildcard character ( ``*``) at the end of the string to match the eventual UUID. For example, the following ``Resource`` element restricts the role or user to creating an index in only the ``us-east-2`` Region of the specified account. ``"Resource": "arn:aws:resource-explorer-2:us-west-2:<account-id>:index/*"`` Alternatively, you can use ``"Resource": "*"`` to allow the role or user to create an index in any Region.
   
  * **Action**: ``iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole`` **Resource**: No specific resource (*). This permission is required only the first time you create an index to turn on Resource Explorer in the account. Resource Explorer uses this to create the `service-linked role needed to index the resources in your account <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/security_iam_service-linked-roles.html>`__. Resource Explorer uses the same service-linked role for all additional indexes you create afterwards.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.create_index(
        ClientToken='string',
        Tags={
            'string': 'string'
        }
    )
    
  :type ClientToken: string
  :param ClientToken: 

    This value helps ensure idempotency. Resource Explorer uses this value to prevent the accidental creation of duplicate versions. We recommend that you generate a `UUID-type value <https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier>`__ to ensure the uniqueness of your index.

    This field is autopopulated if not provided.

  
  :type Tags: dict
  :param Tags: 

    The specified tags are attached only to the index created in this Amazon Web Services Region. The tags aren't attached to any of the resources listed in the index.

    **Response Syntax**

    
    ::

      {
          'Arn': 'string',
          'State': 'CREATING'|'ACTIVE'|'DELETING'|'DELETED'|'UPDATING',
          'CreatedAt': datetime(2015, 1, 1)
      }
      
    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **Arn** *(string) --* 

        The ARN of the new local index for the Region. You can reference this ARN in IAM permission policies to authorize the following operations:  DeleteIndex |  GetIndex |  UpdateIndexType |  CreateView

        
      

      - **State** *(string) --* 

        Indicates the current state of the index. You can check for changes to the state for asynchronous operations by calling the  GetIndex operation.

         

        .. note::

          

          The state can remain in the ``CREATING`` or ``UPDATING`` state for several hours as Resource Explorer discovers the information about your resources and populates the index.

          

        
      

      - **CreatedAt** *(datetime) --* 

        The date and timestamp when the index was created.
