.. py:method:: ResourceExplorer.Client.search(**kwargs)

  

  Searches for resources and displays details about all resources that match the specified criteria. You must specify a query string.

   

  All search queries must use a view. If you don't explicitly specify a view, then Amazon Web Services Resource Explorer uses the default view for the Amazon Web Services Region in which you call this operation. The results are the logical intersection of the results that match both the ``QueryString`` parameter supplied to this operation and the ``SearchFilter`` parameter attached to the view.

   

  For the complete syntax supported by the ``QueryString`` parameter, see `Search query syntax reference for Resource Explorer <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/APIReference/about-query-syntax.html>`__.

   

  If your search results are empty, or are missing results that you think should be there, see `Troubleshooting Resource Explorer search <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/troubleshooting_search.html>`__.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.search(
        QueryString='string',
        MaxResults=123,
        ViewArn='string',
        NextToken='string'
    )
    
  :type QueryString: string
  :param QueryString: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A string that includes keywords and filters that specify the resources that you want to include in the results.

     

    For the complete syntax supported by the ``QueryString`` parameter, see `Search query syntax reference for Resource Explorer <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/using-search-query-syntax.html>`__.

     

    The search is completely case insensitive. You can specify an empty string to return all results up to the limit of 1,000 total results.

     

    .. note::

      

      The operation can return only the first 1,000 results. If the resource you want is not included, then use a different value for ``QueryString`` to refine the results.

      

    

  
  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    The maximum number of results that you want included on each page of the response. If you do not include this parameter, it defaults to a value appropriate to the operation. If additional items exist beyond those included in the current response, the ``NextToken`` response element is present and has a value (is not null). Include that value as the ``NextToken`` request parameter in the next call to the operation to get the next part of the results.

     

    .. note::

      

      An API operation can return fewer results than the maximum even when there are more results available. You should check ``NextToken`` after every operation to ensure that you receive all of the results.

      

    

  
  :type ViewArn: string
  :param ViewArn: 

    Specifies the `Amazon resource name (ARN) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html>`__ of the view to use for the query. If you don't specify a value for this parameter, then the operation automatically uses the default view for the Amazon Web Services Region in which you called this operation. If the Region either doesn't have a default view or if you don't have permission to use the default view, then the operation fails with a ``401 Unauthorized`` exception.

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    The parameter for receiving additional results if you receive a ``NextToken`` response in a previous request. A ``NextToken`` response indicates that more output is available. Set this parameter to the value of the previous call's ``NextToken`` response to indicate where the output should continue from. The pagination tokens expire after 24 hours.

      - **Resources** *(list) --* 

        The list of structures that describe the resources that match the query.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          A resource in Amazon Web Services that Amazon Web Services Resource Explorer has discovered, and for which it has stored information in the index of the Amazon Web Services Region that contains the resource.

          
          

          - **Arn** *(string) --*

          - **OwningAccountId** *(string) --*

          - **Region** *(string) --*

          - **Properties** *(list) --* 

            A structure with additional type-specific details about the resource. These properties can be added by turning on integration between Resource Explorer and other Amazon Web Services services.

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

              A structure that describes a property of a resource.

              
              

              - **Name** *(string) --*

      - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

        If present, indicates that more output is available than is included in the current response. Use this value in the ``NextToken`` request parameter in a subsequent call to the operation to get the next part of the output. You should repeat this until the ``NextToken`` response element comes back as ``null``. The pagination tokens expire after 24 hours.

        
      

      - **ViewArn** *(string) --* 

        The `Amazon resource name (ARN) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html>`__ of the view that this operation used to perform the search.

        
      

      - **Count** *(dict) --*

          The number of resources that match the search query. This value can't exceed 1,000. If there are more than 1,000 resources that match the query, then only 1,000 are counted and the ``Complete`` field is set to false. We recommend that you refine your query to return a smaller number of results.

          
        

        - **Complete** *(boolean) --* 

          Indicates whether the ``TotalResources`` value represents an exhaustive count of search results.

           

          
          * If ``True``, it indicates that the search was exhaustive. Every resource that matches the query was counted.
           
          * If ``False``, then the search reached the limit of 1,000 matching results, and stopped counting.
