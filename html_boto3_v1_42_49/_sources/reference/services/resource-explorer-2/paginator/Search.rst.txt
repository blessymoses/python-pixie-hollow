    **Request Syntax**
    ::

      response_iterator = paginator.paginate(
          QueryString='string',
          ViewArn='string',
          PaginationConfig={
              'MaxItems': 123,
              'PageSize': 123,
              'StartingToken': 'string'
          }
      )
      
    :type QueryString: string
    :param QueryString: **[REQUIRED]** 

      A string that includes keywords and filters that specify the resources that you want to include in the results.

       

      For the complete syntax supported by the ``QueryString`` parameter, see `Search query syntax reference for Resource Explorer <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/using-search-query-syntax.html>`__.

       

      The search is completely case insensitive. You can specify an empty string to return all results up to the limit of 1,000 total results.

       

      .. note::

        

        The operation can return only the first 1,000 results. If the resource you want is not included, then use a different value for ``QueryString`` to refine the results.

        

      

    
    :type ViewArn: string
    :param ViewArn: 

      Specifies the `Amazon resource name (ARN) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html>`__ of the view to use for the query. If you don't specify a value for this parameter, then the operation automatically uses the default view for the Amazon Web Services Region in which you called this operation. If the Region either doesn't have a default view or if you don't have permission to use the default view, then the operation fails with a ``401 Unauthorized`` exception.

      

    
    :type PaginationConfig: dict
    :param PaginationConfig: 

      A dictionary that provides parameters to control pagination.

      

    
      - **MaxItems** *(integer) --* 

        The total number of items to return. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified in max-items then a ``NextToken`` will be provided in the output that you can use to resume pagination.

        

      
      - **PageSize** *(integer) --* 

        The size of each page.

        

      
      - **StartingToken** *(string) --* 

        A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previous response.
