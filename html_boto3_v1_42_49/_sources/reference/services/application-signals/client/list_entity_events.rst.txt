  :type Entity: dict
  :param Entity: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The entity for which to retrieve change events. This specifies the service, resource, or other entity whose event history you want to examine.

     

    This is a string-to-string map. It can include the following fields.

     

    
    * ``Type`` designates the type of object this is.
     
    * ``ResourceType`` specifies the type of the resource. This field is used only when the value of the ``Type`` field is ``Resource`` or ``AWS::Resource``.
     
    * ``Name`` specifies the name of the object. This is used only if the value of the ``Type`` field is ``Service``, ``RemoteService``, or ``AWS::Service``.
     
    * ``Identifier`` identifies the resource objects of this resource. This is used only if the value of the ``Type`` field is ``Resource`` or ``AWS::Resource``.
     
    * ``Environment`` specifies the location where this object is hosted, or what it belongs to.
     
    * ``AwsAccountId`` specifies the account where this object is in.

  :param EndTime: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The end of the time period to retrieve change events for. When used in a raw HTTP Query API, it is formatted as epoch time in seconds. For example: ``1698778057``

    

  
  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    The maximum number of change events to return in one operation. If you omit this parameter, the default of 50 is used.
