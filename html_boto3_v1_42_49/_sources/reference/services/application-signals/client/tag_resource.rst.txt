.. py:method:: CloudWatchApplicationSignals.Client.tag_resource(**kwargs)

  

  Assigns one or more tags (key-value pairs) to the specified CloudWatch resource, such as a service level objective.

   

  Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also use them to scope user permissions by granting a user permission to access or change only resources with certain tag values.

   

  Tags don't have any semantic meaning to Amazon Web Services and are interpreted strictly as strings of characters.

   

  You can use the ``TagResource`` action with an alarm that already has tags. If you specify a new tag key for the alarm, this tag is appended to the list of tags associated with the alarm. If you specify a tag key that is already associated with the alarm, the new tag value that you specify replaces the previous value for that tag.

   

  You can associate as many as 50 tags with a CloudWatch resource.
