  :type StartTime: datetime
  :param StartTime: **[REQUIRED]**

    * ``Type`` designates the type of object this is.
     
    * ``ResourceType`` specifies the type of the resource. This field is used only when the value of the ``Type`` field is ``Resource`` or ``AWS::Resource``.

  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults:

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **StartTime** *(datetime) --* 

        The start of the time period that the returned information applies to. When used in a raw HTTP Query API, it is formatted as be epoch time in seconds. For example: ``1698778057``

         

        This displays the time that Application Signals used for the request. It might not match your request exactly, because it was rounded to the nearest hour.

        
      

      - **EndTime** *(datetime) --* 

        The end of the time period that the returned information applies to. When used in a raw HTTP Query API, it is formatted as be epoch time in seconds. For example: ``1698778057``

         

        This displays the time that Application Signals used for the request. It might not match your request exactly, because it was rounded to the nearest hour.

        
      

      - **ServiceOperations** *(list) --* 

        An array of structures that each contain information about one operation of this service.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          This structure contains information about an operation discovered by Application Signals. An operation is a specific function performed by a service that was discovered by Application Signals, and is often an API that is called by an upstream dependent.

          
          

          - **Name** *(string) --* 

            The name of the operation, discovered by Application Signals.

            
          

          - **MetricReferences** *(list) --* 

            An array of structures that each contain information about one metric associated with this service operation that was discovered by Application Signals.

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

              This structure contains information about one CloudWatch metric associated with this entity discovered by Application Signals.

              
              

              - **Namespace** *(string) --* 

                The namespace of the metric. For more information, see `CloudWatchNamespaces <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch_concepts.html#Namespace>`__.

                
              

              - **MetricType** *(string) --* 

                Used to display the appropriate statistics in the CloudWatch console.

                
              

              - **Dimensions** *(list) --* 

                An array of one or more dimensions that further define the metric. For more information, see `CloudWatchDimensions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch_concepts.html#Dimension>`__.

                
                

                - *(dict) --* 

                  A dimension is a name/value pair that is part of the identity of a metric. Because dimensions are part of the unique identifier for a metric, whenever you add a unique name/value pair to one of your metrics, you are creating a new variation of that metric. For example, many Amazon EC2 metrics publish ``InstanceId`` as a dimension name, and the actual instance ID as the value for that dimension.

                   

                  You can assign up to 30 dimensions to a metric.

                  
                  

                  - **Name** *(string) --* 

                    The name of the dimension. Dimension names must contain only ASCII characters, must include at least one non-whitespace character, and cannot start with a colon ( ``:``). ASCII control characters are not supported as part of dimension names.

                    
                  

                  - **Value** *(string) --* 

                    The value of the dimension. Dimension values must contain only ASCII characters and must include at least one non-whitespace character. ASCII control characters are not supported as part of dimension values.

                    
              
            
              

              - **MetricName** *(string) --* 

                The name of the metric.

                
              

              - **AccountId** *(string) --* 

                Amazon Web Services account ID.

                
          
        
      
    
      

      - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

        Include this value in your next use of this API to get next set of service operations.
