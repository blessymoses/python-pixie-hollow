    A list of attribute filters to narrow down the services. You can filter by platform, environment, or other service attributes.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      A structure that defines a filter for narrowing down results based on specific attribute values. This can be used to filter services by platform, environment, or other service characteristics.

      

    
      - **AttributeFilterName** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The name of the attribute to filter by, such as ``Platform``, ``Environment``, or ``BusinessUnit``.

        

      
      - **AttributeFilterValues** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]**
