        }
    )
    
  :type StartTime: datetime
  :param StartTime: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The start of the time period to retrieve information about. When used in a raw HTTP Query API, it is formatted as be epoch time in seconds. For example: ``1698778057``

     

    Your requested start time will be rounded to the nearest hour.

    

  
  :type EndTime: datetime
  :param EndTime: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The end of the time period to retrieve information about. When used in a raw HTTP Query API, it is formatted as be epoch time in seconds. For example: ``1698778057``

     

    Your requested start time will be rounded to the nearest hour.

    

  
  :type KeyAttributes: dict
  :param KeyAttributes: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Use this field to specify which service you want to retrieve information for. You must specify at least the ``Type``, ``Name``, and ``Environment`` attributes.

     

    This is a string-to-string map. It can include the following fields.

     

    
    * ``Type`` designates the type of object this is.
     
    * ``ResourceType`` specifies the type of the resource. This field is used only when the value of the ``Type`` field is ``Resource`` or ``AWS::Resource``.
     
    * ``Name`` specifies the name of the object. This is used only if the value of the ``Type`` field is ``Service``, ``RemoteService``, or ``AWS::Service``.
     
    * ``Identifier`` identifies the resource objects of this resource. This is used only if the value of the ``Type`` field is ``Resource`` or ``AWS::Resource``.

            This structure contains information about one CloudWatch metric associated with this entity discovered by Application Signals.

            
            

            - **Namespace** *(string) --* 

              The namespace of the metric. For more information, see `CloudWatchNamespaces <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch_concepts.html#Namespace>`__.

              
            

            - **MetricType** *(string) --* 

              Used to display the appropriate statistics in the CloudWatch console.

              An array of one or more dimensions that further define the metric. For more information, see `CloudWatchDimensions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch_concepts.html#Dimension>`__.

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                A dimension is a name/value pair that is part of the identity of a metric. Because dimensions are part of the unique identifier for a metric, whenever you add a unique name/value pair to one of your metrics, you are creating a new variation of that metric. For example, many Amazon EC2 metrics publish ``InstanceId`` as a dimension name, and the actual instance ID as the value for that dimension.

                 

                You can assign up to 30 dimensions to a metric.

                
                

                - **Name** *(string) --* 

                  The name of the dimension. Dimension names must contain only ASCII characters, must include at least one non-whitespace character, and cannot start with a colon ( ``:``). ASCII control characters are not supported as part of dimension names.

                  
                

                - **Value** *(string) --* 

                  The value of the dimension. Dimension values must contain only ASCII characters and must include at least one non-whitespace character. ASCII control characters are not supported as part of dimension values.

                  
            
          
            

            - **MetricName** *(string) --*

      - **StartTime** *(datetime) --* 

        The start time of the data included in the response. In a raw HTTP Query API, it is formatted as be epoch time in seconds. For example: ``1698778057``.

         

        This displays the time that Application Signals used for the request. It might not match your request exactly, because it was rounded to the nearest hour.
