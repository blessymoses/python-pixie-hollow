      )
      
    :type StartTime: datetime
    :param StartTime: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The start of the time period to retrieve information about. When used in a raw HTTP Query API, it is formatted as be epoch time in seconds. For example: ``1698778057``

       

      Your requested start time will be rounded to the nearest hour.

      

    
    :type EndTime: datetime
    :param EndTime: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The end of the time period to retrieve information about. When used in a raw HTTP Query API, it is formatted as be epoch time in seconds. For example: ``1698778057``

       

      Your requested end time will be rounded to the nearest hour.

      

    
    :type KeyAttributes: dict
    :param KeyAttributes: **[REQUIRED]** 

      Use this field to specify which service you want to retrieve information for. You must specify at least the ``Type``, ``Name``, and ``Environment`` attributes.

       

      This is a string-to-string map. It can include the following fields.

       

      
      * ``Type`` designates the type of object this is.
       
      * ``ResourceType`` specifies the type of the resource. This field is used only when the value of the ``Type`` field is ``Resource`` or ``AWS::Resource``.
       
      * ``Name`` specifies the name of the object. This is used only if the value of the ``Type`` field is ``Service``, ``RemoteService``, or ``AWS::Service``.
       
      * ``Identifier`` identifies the resource objects of this resource. This is used only if the value of the ``Type`` field is ``Resource`` or ``AWS::Resource``.
       
      * ``Environment`` specifies the location where this object is hosted, or what it belongs to.

        The total number of items to return. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified in max-items then a ``NextToken`` will be provided in the output that you can use to resume pagination.

        

      
      - **PageSize** *(integer) --* 

        The size of each page.

        

      
      - **StartingToken** *(string) --* 

        A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previous response.

      - *(dict) --* 
        

        - **StartTime** *(datetime) --*

                This structure contains information about one CloudWatch metric associated with this entity discovered by Application Signals.

                
                

                - **Namespace** *(string) --* 

                  The namespace of the metric. For more information, see `CloudWatchNamespaces <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch_concepts.html#Namespace>`__.

                  
                

                - **MetricType** *(string) --* 

                  Used to display the appropriate statistics in the CloudWatch console.

                  An array of one or more dimensions that further define the metric. For more information, see `CloudWatchDimensions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch_concepts.html#Dimension>`__.

                  
                  

                  - *(dict) --* 

                    A dimension is a name/value pair that is part of the identity of a metric. Because dimensions are part of the unique identifier for a metric, whenever you add a unique name/value pair to one of your metrics, you are creating a new variation of that metric. For example, many Amazon EC2 metrics publish ``InstanceId`` as a dimension name, and the actual instance ID as the value for that dimension.

                     

                    You can assign up to 30 dimensions to a metric.

                    
                    

                    - **Name** *(string) --* 

                      The name of the dimension. Dimension names must contain only ASCII characters, must include at least one non-whitespace character, and cannot start with a colon ( ``:``). ASCII control characters are not supported as part of dimension names.

                      
                    

                    - **Value** *(string) --* 

                      The value of the dimension. Dimension values must contain only ASCII characters and must include at least one non-whitespace character. ASCII control characters are not supported as part of dimension values.

                      
                
              
                

                - **MetricName** *(string) --* 

                  The name of the metric.

                  
                

                - **AccountId** *(string) --*
