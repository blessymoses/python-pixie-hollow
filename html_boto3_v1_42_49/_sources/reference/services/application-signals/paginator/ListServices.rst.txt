                - **Dimensions** *(list) --* 

                  An array of one or more dimensions that further define the metric. For more information, see `CloudWatchDimensions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch_concepts.html#Dimension>`__.

                  
                  

                  - *(dict) --* 

                    A dimension is a name/value pair that is part of the identity of a metric. Because dimensions are part of the unique identifier for a metric, whenever you add a unique name/value pair to one of your metrics, you are creating a new variation of that metric. For example, many Amazon EC2 metrics publish ``InstanceId`` as a dimension name, and the actual instance ID as the value for that dimension.

                     

                    You can assign up to 30 dimensions to a metric.

                    - **Value** *(string) --* 

                      The value of the dimension. Dimension values must contain only ASCII characters and must include at least one non-whitespace character. ASCII control characters are not supported as part of dimension values.
