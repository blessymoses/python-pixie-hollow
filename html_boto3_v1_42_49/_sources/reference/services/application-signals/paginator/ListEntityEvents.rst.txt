    :type Entity: dict
    :param Entity: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The entity for which to retrieve change events. This specifies the service, resource, or other entity whose event history you want to examine.

       

      This is a string-to-string map. It can include the following fields.

       

      
      * ``Type`` designates the type of object this is.
       
      * ``ResourceType`` specifies the type of the resource. This field is used only when the value of the ``Type`` field is ``Resource`` or ``AWS::Resource``.
       
      * ``Name`` specifies the name of the object. This is used only if the value of the ``Type`` field is ``Service``, ``RemoteService``, or ``AWS::Service``.
       
      * ``Identifier`` identifies the resource objects of this resource. This is used only if the value of the ``Type`` field is ``Resource`` or ``AWS::Resource``.
       
      * ``Environment`` specifies the location where this object is hosted, or what it belongs to.
       
      * ``AwsAccountId`` specifies the account where this object is in.
      

       

      Below is an example of a service.

       

      ``{ "Type": "Service", "Name": "visits-service", "Environment": "petclinic-test" }``

       

      Below is an example of a resource.

      A dictionary that provides parameters to control pagination.

      

    
      - **MaxItems** *(integer) --*
