.. py:method:: DirectConnect.Client.describe_direct_connect_gateway_associations(**kwargs)

  

  Lists the associations between your Direct Connect gateways and virtual private gateways and transit gateways. You must specify one of the following:

   

  
  * A Direct Connect gateway The response contains all virtual private gateways and transit gateways associated with the Direct Connect gateway.
   
  * A virtual private gateway The response contains the Direct Connect gateway.
   
  * A transit gateway The response contains the Direct Connect gateway.
   
  * A Direct Connect gateway and a virtual private gateway The response contains the association between the Direct Connect gateway and virtual private gateway.
   
  * A Direct Connect gateway and a transit gateway The response contains the association between the Direct Connect gateway and transit gateway.
   
  * A Direct Connect gateway and a virtual private gateway The response contains the association between the Direct Connect gateway and virtual private gateway.
   
  * A Direct Connect gateway association to a Cloud WAN core network The response contains the Cloud WAN core network ID that the Direct Connect gateway is associated to.
