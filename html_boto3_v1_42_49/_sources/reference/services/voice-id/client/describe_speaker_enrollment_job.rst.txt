    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **Job** *(dict) --* 

        Contains details about the specified speaker enrollment job.

        
        

        - **CreatedAt** *(datetime) --* 

          A timestamp of when the speaker enrollment job was created.

          
        

        - **DataAccessRoleArn** *(string) --* 

          The IAM role Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that grants Voice ID permissions to access customer's buckets to read the input manifest file and write the job output file.

          
        

        - **DomainId** *(string) --* 

          The identifier of the domain that contains the speaker enrollment job.

          
        

        - **EndedAt** *(datetime) --* 

          A timestamp of when the speaker enrollment job ended.

          
        

        - **EnrollmentConfig** *(dict) --* 

          The configuration that defines the action to take when the speaker is already enrolled in Voice ID, and the ``FraudDetectionConfig`` to use.

          
          

          - **ExistingEnrollmentAction** *(string) --* 

            The action to take when the specified speaker is already enrolled in the specified domain. The default value is ``SKIP``, which skips the enrollment for the existing speaker. Setting the value to ``OVERWRITE`` replaces the existing voice prints and enrollment audio stored for that speaker with new data generated from the latest audio.

            
          

          - **FraudDetectionConfig** *(dict) --* 

            The fraud detection configuration to use for the speaker enrollment job.

            
            

            - **FraudDetectionAction** *(string) --* 

              The action to take when the given speaker is flagged by the fraud detection system. The default value is ``FAIL``, which fails the speaker enrollment. Changing this value to ``IGNORE`` results in the speaker being enrolled even if they are flagged by the fraud detection system.

              
            

            - **RiskThreshold** *(integer) --* 

              Threshold value for determining whether the speaker is a high risk to be fraudulent. If the detected risk score calculated by Voice ID is greater than or equal to the threshold, the speaker is considered a fraudster.

              
            

            - **WatchlistIds** *(list) --* 

              The identifier of watchlists against which fraud detection is performed.

              
              

              - *(string) --* 
          
        
      
        

        - **FailureDetails** *(dict) --* 

          Contains details that are populated when an entire batch job fails. In cases of individual registration job failures, the batch job as a whole doesn't fail; it is completed with a ``JobStatus`` of ``COMPLETED_WITH_ERRORS``. You can use the job output file to identify the individual registration requests that failed.

          
          

          - **Message** *(string) --* 

            A description of the error that caused the batch job failure.

            
          

          - **StatusCode** *(integer) --* 

            An HTTP status code representing the nature of the error.

            
      
        

        - **InputDataConfig** *(dict) --* 

          The input data config containing an S3 URI for the input manifest file that contains the list of speaker enrollment job requests.

          
          

          - **S3Uri** *(string) --* 

            The S3 location for the input manifest file that contains the list of individual enrollment or registration job requests.

            
      
        

        - **JobId** *(string) --* 

          The service-generated identifier for the speaker enrollment job.

          
        

        - **JobName** *(string) --* 

          The client-provided name for the speaker enrollment job.

          
        

        - **JobProgress** *(dict) --* 

          Provides details on job progress. This field shows the completed percentage of registration requests listed in the input file.

          
          

          - **PercentComplete** *(integer) --* 

            Shows the completed percentage of enrollment or registration requests listed in the input file.

            
      
        

        - **JobStatus** *(string) --* 

          The current status of the speaker enrollment job.

          
        

        - **OutputDataConfig** *(dict) --* 

          The output data config containing the S3 location where Voice ID writes the job output file; you must also include a KMS key ID to encrypt the file.

          
          

          - **KmsKeyId** *(string) --* 

            The identifier of the KMS key you want Voice ID to use to encrypt the output file of a speaker enrollment job/fraudster registration job.

            
          

          - **S3Uri** *(string) --* 

            The S3 path of the folder where Voice ID writes the job output file. It has a ``*.out`` extension. For example, if the input file name is ``input-file.json`` and the output folder path is ``s3://output-bucket/output-folder``, the full output file path is ``s3://output-bucket/output-folder/job-Id/input-file.json.out``.
