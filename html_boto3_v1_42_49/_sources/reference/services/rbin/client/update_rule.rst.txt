.. py:method:: RecycleBin.Client.update_rule(**kwargs)

  

  Updates an existing Recycle Bin retention rule. You can update a retention rule's description, resource tags, and retention period at any time after creation. You can't update a retention rule's resource type after creation. For more information, see `Update Recycle Bin retention rules <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/recycle-bin-working-with-rules.html#recycle-bin-update-rule>`__ in the *Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide*.

        ]
    )
    
  :type Identifier: string
  :param Identifier: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The unique ID of the retention rule.

    

  
  :type RetentionPeriod: dict
  :param RetentionPeriod: 

    Information about the retention period for which the retention rule is to retain resources.

    

  
    - **RetentionPeriodValue** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The period value for which the retention rule is to retain resources, measured in days. The supported retention periods are:

       

      
      * EBS volumes: 1 - 7 days
       
      * EBS snapshots and EBS-backed AMIs: 1 - 365 days
      

      

    
    - **RetentionPeriodUnit** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The unit of time in which the retention period is measured. Currently, only ``DAYS`` is supported.

      

    
  
  :type Description: string
  :param Description: 

    The retention rule description.

    

  
  :type ResourceType: string
  :param ResourceType: 

    .. note::

      

      This parameter is currently not supported. You can't update a retention rule's resource type after creation.

      

    

  
  :type ResourceTags: list
  :param ResourceTags: 

    [Tag-level retention rules only] Specifies the resource tags to use to identify resources that are to be retained by a tag-level retention rule. For tag-level retention rules, only deleted resources, of the specified resource type, that have one or more of the specified tag key and value pairs are retained. If a resource is deleted, but it does not have any of the specified tag key and value pairs, it is immediately deleted without being retained by the retention rule.

     

    You can add the same tag key and value pair to a maximum or five retention rules.

     

    To create a Region-level retention rule, omit this parameter. A Region-level retention rule does not have any resource tags specified. It retains all deleted resources of the specified resource type in the Region in which the rule is created, even if the resources are not tagged.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      [Tag-level retention rules only] Information about the resource tags used to identify resources that are retained by the retention rule.

      

    
      - **ResourceTagKey** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The tag key.

        

      
      - **ResourceTagValue** *(string) --* 

        The tag value.

        

      
    

  :type ExcludeResourceTags: list
  :param ExcludeResourceTags: 

    [Region-level retention rules only] Specifies the exclusion tags to use to identify resources that are to be excluded, or ignored, by a Region-level retention rule. Resources that have any of these tags are not retained by the retention rule upon deletion.

     

    You can't specify exclusion tags for tag-level retention rules.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      [Tag-level retention rules only] Information about the resource tags used to identify resources that are retained by the retention rule.

      

    
      - **ResourceTagKey** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The tag key.

        

      
      - **ResourceTagValue** *(string) --* 

        The tag value.
