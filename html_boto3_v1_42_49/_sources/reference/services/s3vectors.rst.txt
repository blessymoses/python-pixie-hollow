.. py:class:: S3Vectors.Client

  A low-level client representing Amazon S3 Vectors
  

  Amazon S3 vector buckets are a bucket type to store and search vectors with sub-second search times. They are designed to provide dedicated API operations for you to interact with vectors to do similarity search. Within a vector bucket, you use a vector index to organize and logically group your vector data. When you make a write or read request, you direct it to a single vector index. You store your vector data as vectors. A vector contains a key (a name that you assign), a multi-dimensional vector, and, optionally, metadata that describes a vector. The key uniquely identifies the vector in a vector index.

Paginators

Paginators are available on a client instance via the ``get_paginator`` method. For more detailed instructions and examples on the usage of paginators, see the paginators `user guide <https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/paginators.html>`_.

The available paginators are:
