.. py:method:: Personalize.Client.delete_solution(**kwargs)

  

  Deletes all versions of a solution and the ``Solution`` object itself. Before deleting a solution, you must delete all campaigns based on the solution. To determine what campaigns are using the solution, call `ListCampaigns <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_ListCampaigns.html>`__ and supply the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the solution. You can't delete a solution if an associated ``SolutionVersion`` is in the CREATE PENDING or IN PROGRESS state. For more information on solutions, see `CreateSolution <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_CreateSolution.html>`__.
