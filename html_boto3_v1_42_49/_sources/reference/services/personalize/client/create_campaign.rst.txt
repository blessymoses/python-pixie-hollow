.. py:method:: Personalize.Client.create_campaign(**kwargs)

  

  .. warning::

    

    You incur campaign costs while it is active. To avoid unnecessary costs, make sure to delete the campaign when you are finished. For information about campaign costs, see `Amazon Personalize pricing <https://aws.amazon.com/personalize/pricing/>`__.

     

   

  Creates a campaign that deploys a solution version. When a client calls the `GetRecommendations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_RS_GetRecommendations.html>`__ and `GetPersonalizedRanking <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_RS_GetPersonalizedRanking.html>`__ APIs, a campaign is specified in the request.

   

  **Minimum Provisioned TPS and Auto-Scaling**

   

  .. warning::

     

    A high ``minProvisionedTPS`` will increase your cost. We recommend starting with 1 for ``minProvisionedTPS`` (the default). Track your usage using Amazon CloudWatch metrics, and increase the ``minProvisionedTPS`` as necessary.

     

   

  When you create an Amazon Personalize campaign, you can specify the minimum provisioned transactions per second ( ``minProvisionedTPS``) for the campaign. This is the baseline transaction throughput for the campaign provisioned by Amazon Personalize. It sets the minimum billing charge for the campaign while it is active. A transaction is a single ``GetRecommendations`` or ``GetPersonalizedRanking`` request. The default ``minProvisionedTPS`` is 1.

   

  If your TPS increases beyond the ``minProvisionedTPS``, Amazon Personalize auto-scales the provisioned capacity up and down, but never below ``minProvisionedTPS``. There's a short time delay while the capacity is increased that might cause loss of transactions. When your traffic reduces, capacity returns to the ``minProvisionedTPS``.

   

  You are charged for the the minimum provisioned TPS or, if your requests exceed the ``minProvisionedTPS``, the actual TPS. The actual TPS is the total number of recommendation requests you make. We recommend starting with a low ``minProvisionedTPS``, track your usage using Amazon CloudWatch metrics, and then increase the ``minProvisionedTPS`` as necessary.

   

  For more information about campaign costs, see `Amazon Personalize pricing <https://aws.amazon.com/personalize/pricing/>`__.

   

  **Status**

   

  A campaign can be in one of the following states:

   

  
  * CREATE PENDING > CREATE IN_PROGRESS > ACTIVE -or- CREATE FAILED
   
  * DELETE PENDING > DELETE IN_PROGRESS
  

   

  To get the campaign status, call `DescribeCampaign <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_DescribeCampaign.html>`__.

   

  .. note::

    

    Wait until the ``status`` of the campaign is ``ACTIVE`` before asking the campaign for recommendations.

        ]
    )
    
  :type name: string
  :param name: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A name for the new campaign. The campaign name must be unique within your account.

    

  
  :type solutionVersionArn: string
  :param solutionVersionArn: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the trained model to deploy with the campaign. To specify the latest solution version of your solution, specify the ARN of your *solution* in ``SolutionArn/$LATEST`` format. You must use this format if you set ``syncWithLatestSolutionVersion`` to ``True`` in the `CampaignConfig <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_CampaignConfig.html>`__.

     

    To deploy a model that isn't the latest solution version of your solution, specify the ARN of the solution version.

  :type minProvisionedTPS: integer
  :param minProvisionedTPS: 

    Specifies the requested minimum provisioned transactions (recommendations) per second that Amazon Personalize will support. A high ``minProvisionedTPS`` will increase your bill. We recommend starting with 1 for ``minProvisionedTPS`` (the default). Track your usage using Amazon CloudWatch metrics, and increase the ``minProvisionedTPS`` as necessary.

    

  
  :type campaignConfig: dict
  :param campaignConfig: 

    The configuration details of a campaign.

    

  
    - **itemExplorationConfig** *(dict) --* 

      Specifies the exploration configuration hyperparameters, including ``explorationWeight`` and ``explorationItemAgeCutOff``, you want to use to configure the amount of item exploration Amazon Personalize uses when recommending items. Provide ``itemExplorationConfig`` data only if your solution uses the `User-Personalization <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/native-recipe-new-item-USER_PERSONALIZATION.html>`__ recipe.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
  

    - **enableMetadataWithRecommendations** *(boolean) --* 

      Whether metadata with recommendations is enabled for the campaign. If enabled, you can specify the columns from your Items dataset in your request for recommendations. Amazon Personalize returns this data for each item in the recommendation response. For information about enabling metadata for a campaign, see `Enabling metadata in recommendations for a campaign <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/campaigns.html#create-campaign-return-metadata>`__.

       

      If you enable metadata in recommendations, you will incur additional costs. For more information, see `Amazon Personalize pricing <https://aws.amazon.com/personalize/pricing/>`__.

      

    
    - **syncWithLatestSolutionVersion** *(boolean) --* 

      Whether the campaign automatically updates to use the latest solution version (trained model) of a solution. If you specify ``True``, you must specify the ARN of your *solution* for the ``SolutionVersionArn`` parameter. It must be in ``SolutionArn/$LATEST`` format. The default is ``False`` and you must manually update the campaign to deploy the latest solution version.

    - **rankingInfluence** *(dict) --* 

      A map of ranking influence values for POPULARITY and FRESHNESS. For each key, specify a numerical value between 0.0 and 1.0 that determines how much influence that ranking factor has on the final recommendations. A value closer to 1.0 gives more weight to the factor, while a value closer to 0.0 reduces its influence.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
        - *(float) --*

    - *(dict) --* 

      The optional metadata that you apply to resources to help you categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. For more information see `Tagging Amazon Personalize resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/tagging-resources.html>`__.

      

    
      - **tagKey** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

      - **tagValue** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The optional part of a key-value pair that makes up a tag. A value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).
