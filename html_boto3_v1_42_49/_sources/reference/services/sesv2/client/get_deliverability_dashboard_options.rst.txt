.. py:method:: SESV2.Client.get_deliverability_dashboard_options()

  

  Retrieve information about the status of the Deliverability dashboard for your account. When the Deliverability dashboard is enabled, you gain access to reputation, deliverability, and other metrics for the domains that you use to send email. You also gain the ability to perform predictive inbox placement tests.

   

  When you use the Deliverability dashboard, you pay a monthly subscription charge, in addition to any other fees that you accrue by using Amazon SES and other Amazon Web Services services. For more information about the features and cost of a Deliverability dashboard subscription, see `Amazon SES Pricing <http://aws.amazon.com/ses/pricing/>`__.
