                  - **DiagnosticCode** *(string) --* 

                    The status code issued by the reporting Message Transfer Authority (MTA). This field only appears if a delivery status notification (DSN) was attached to the bounce and the ``Diagnostic-Code`` was provided in the DSN.

                    Can either be ``null`` or ``OnAccountSuppressionList``. If the value is ``OnAccountSuppressionList``, SES accepted the message, but didn't attempt to send it because it was on the account-level suppression list.
