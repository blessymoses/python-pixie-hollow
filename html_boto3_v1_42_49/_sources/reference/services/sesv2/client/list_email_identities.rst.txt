    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 

      A list of all of the identities that you've attempted to verify, regardless of whether or not those identities were successfully verified.

      
      

      - **EmailIdentities** *(list) --* 

        An array that includes all of the email identities associated with your Amazon Web Services account.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          Information about an email identity.

          
          

          - **IdentityType** *(string) --* 

            The email identity type. Note: the ``MANAGED_DOMAIN`` type is not supported for email identity types.

            
          

          - **IdentityName** *(string) --* 

            The address or domain of the identity.

            
          

          - **SendingEnabled** *(boolean) --* 

            Indicates whether or not you can send email from the identity.

             

            An *identity* is an email address or domain that you send email from. Before you can send email from an identity, you have to demostrate that you own the identity, and that you authorize Amazon SES to send email from that identity.

            
          

          - **VerificationStatus** *(string) --* 

            The verification status of the identity. The status can be one of the following:

             

            
            * ``PENDING`` – The verification process was initiated, but Amazon SES hasn't yet been able to verify the identity.
             
            * ``SUCCESS`` – The verification process completed successfully.
             
            * ``FAILED`` – The verification process failed.
             
            * ``TEMPORARY_FAILURE`` – A temporary issue is preventing Amazon SES from determining the verification status of the identity.
             
            * ``NOT_STARTED`` – The verification process hasn't been initiated for the identity.
            

            
      
    
      

      - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

        A token that indicates that there are additional configuration sets to list. To view additional configuration sets, issue another request to ``ListEmailIdentities``, and pass this token in the ``NextToken`` parameter.
