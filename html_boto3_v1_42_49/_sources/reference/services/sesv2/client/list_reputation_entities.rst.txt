            The aggregate sending status that determines whether the entity is allowed to send emails. This status is derived from both the customer-managed and Amazon Web Services Amazon SES-managed statuses. If either the customer-managed status or the Amazon Web Services Amazon SES-managed status is ``DISABLED``, the aggregate status will be ``DISABLED`` and the entity will not be allowed to send emails. When the customer-managed status is set to ``REINSTATED``, the entity can continue sending even if there are active reputation findings, provided the Amazon Web Services Amazon SES-managed status also permits sending. The entity can only send emails when both statuses permit sending.

            
          

          - **ReputationImpact** *(string) --* 

            The reputation impact level for this entity, representing the highest impact reputation finding currently active. Reputation findings can be retrieved using the ``ListRecommendations`` operation.

            
      
    
      

      - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

        A token that indicates that there are additional reputation entities to list. To view additional reputation entities, issue another request to ``ListReputationEntities``, and pass this token in the ``NextToken`` parameter.
