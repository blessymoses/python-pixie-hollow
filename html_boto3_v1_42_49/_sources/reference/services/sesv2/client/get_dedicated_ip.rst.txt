    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 

      Information about a dedicated IP address.

      
      

      - **DedicatedIp** *(dict) --* 

        An object that contains information about a dedicated IP address.

        
        

        - **Ip** *(string) --* 

          An IPv4 address.

          
        

        - **WarmupStatus** *(string) --* 

          The warm-up status of a dedicated IP address. The status can have one of the following values:

           

          
          * ``IN_PROGRESS`` – The IP address isn't ready to use because the dedicated IP warm-up process is ongoing.
           
          * ``DONE`` – The dedicated IP warm-up process is complete, and the IP address is ready to use.
           
          * ``NOT_APPLICABLE`` – The warm-up status doesn't apply to this IP address. This status is used for IP addresses in managed dedicated IP pools, where Amazon SES automatically handles the warm-up process.
          

          
        

        - **WarmupPercentage** *(integer) --* 

          Indicates the progress of your dedicated IP warm-up:

           

          
          * ``0-100`` – For standard dedicated IP addresses, this shows the warm-up completion percentage. A value of 100 means the IP address is fully warmed up and ready for use.
           
          * ``-1`` – Appears for IP addresses in managed dedicated pools where Amazon SES automatically handles the warm-up process, making the percentage not applicable.
          

          
        

        - **PoolName** *(string) --* 

          The name of the dedicated IP pool that the IP address is associated with.
