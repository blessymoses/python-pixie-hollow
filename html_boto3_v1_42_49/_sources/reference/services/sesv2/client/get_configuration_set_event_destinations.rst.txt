.. py:method:: SESV2.Client.get_configuration_set_event_destinations(**kwargs)

  

  Retrieve a list of event destinations that are associated with a configuration set.

   

  *Events* include message sends, deliveries, opens, clicks, bounces, and complaints. *Event destinations* are places that you can send information about these events to. For example, you can send event data to Amazon EventBridge and associate a rule to send the event to the specified target.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 

      Information about an event destination for a configuration set.

      
      

      - **EventDestinations** *(list) --* 

        An array that includes all of the events destinations that have been configured for the configuration set.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          In the Amazon SES API v2, *events* include message sends, deliveries, opens, clicks, bounces, complaints and delivery delays. *Event destinations* are places that you can send information about these events to. For example, you can send event data to Amazon SNS to receive notifications when you receive bounces or complaints, or you can use Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to stream data to Amazon S3 for long-term storage.

          
          

          - **Name** *(string) --* 

            A name that identifies the event destination.

            
          

          - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

            If ``true``, the event destination is enabled. When the event destination is enabled, the specified event types are sent to the destinations in this ``EventDestinationDefinition``.

             

            If ``false``, the event destination is disabled. When the event destination is disabled, events aren't sent to the specified destinations.

            
          

          - **MatchingEventTypes** *(list) --* 

            The types of events that Amazon SES sends to the specified event destinations.

             

            
            * ``SEND`` - The send request was successful and SES will attempt to deliver the message to the recipient’s mail server. (If account-level or global suppression is being used, SES will still count it as a send, but delivery is suppressed.)
             
            * ``REJECT`` - SES accepted the email, but determined that it contained a virus and didn’t attempt to deliver it to the recipient’s mail server.
             
            * ``BOUNCE`` - (*Hard bounce*) The recipient's mail server permanently rejected the email. (*Soft bounces* are only included when SES fails to deliver the email after retrying for a period of time.)
             
            * ``COMPLAINT`` - The email was successfully delivered to the recipient’s mail server, but the recipient marked it as spam.
             
            * ``DELIVERY`` - SES successfully delivered the email to the recipient's mail server.
             
            * ``OPEN`` - The recipient received the message and opened it in their email client.
             
            * ``CLICK`` - The recipient clicked one or more links in the email.
             
            * ``RENDERING_FAILURE`` - The email wasn't sent because of a template rendering issue. This event type can occur when template data is missing, or when there is a mismatch between template parameters and data. (This event type only occurs when you send email using the `SendEmail <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/APIReference-V2/API_SendEmail.html>`__ or `SendBulkEmail <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/APIReference-V2/API_SendBulkEmail.html>`__ API operations.)
             
            * ``DELIVERY_DELAY`` - The email couldn't be delivered to the recipient’s mail server because a temporary issue occurred. Delivery delays can occur, for example, when the recipient's inbox is full, or when the receiving email server experiences a transient issue.
             
            * ``SUBSCRIPTION`` - The email was successfully delivered, but the recipient updated their subscription preferences by clicking on an *unsubscribe* link as part of your `subscription management <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/sending-email-subscription-management.html>`__.
            

            
            

            - *(string) --*

            - **IamRoleArn** *(string) --* 

              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that the Amazon SES API v2 uses to send email events to the Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose stream.
