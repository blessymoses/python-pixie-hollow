Excludes deliveries to the mailbox simulator, for emails addressed to more than one recipient, and emails addressed to recipients hosted by ISPs with which Amazon SES does not have a feedback loop agreement.
        

        

      
      - **Dimensions** *(dict) --* 

        An object that contains mapping between ``MetricDimensionName`` and ``MetricDimensionValue`` to filter metrics by.

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

          The ``BatchGetMetricDataQuery`` dimension name. This can be one of the following:

          - *(string) --* 

            A list of values associated with the ``MetricDimensionName`` to filter metrics by. Can either be ``*`` as a wildcard for all values or a list of up to 10 specific values. If one ``Dimension`` has the ``*`` value, other dimensions can only contain one value.

            

          
    
  
      - **StartDate** *(datetime) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        Represents the start date for the query interval.
