    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 

      Details about an email identity.

      
      

      - **IdentityType** *(string) --* 

        The email identity type. Note: the ``MANAGED_DOMAIN`` identity type is not supported.

        
      

      - **FeedbackForwardingStatus** *(boolean) --* 

        The feedback forwarding configuration for the identity.

         

        If the value is ``true``, you receive email notifications when bounce or complaint events occur. These notifications are sent to the address that you specified in the ``Return-Path`` header of the original email.

         

        You're required to have a method of tracking bounces and complaints. If you haven't set up another mechanism for receiving bounce or complaint notifications (for example, by setting up an event destination), you receive an email notification when these events occur (even if this setting is disabled).

        
      

      - **VerifiedForSendingStatus** *(boolean) --* 

        Specifies whether or not the identity is verified. You can only send email from verified email addresses or domains. For more information about verifying identities, see the `Amazon Pinpoint User Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/userguide/channels-email-manage-verify.html>`__.

        
      

      - **DkimAttributes** *(dict) --* 

        An object that contains information about the DKIM attributes for the identity.

        
        

        - **SigningEnabled** *(boolean) --* 

          If the value is ``true``, then the messages that you send from the identity are signed using DKIM. If the value is ``false``, then the messages that you send from the identity aren't DKIM-signed.

          
        

        - **Status** *(string) --* 

          Describes whether or not Amazon SES has successfully located the DKIM records in the DNS records for the domain. The status can be one of the following:

           

          
          * ``PENDING`` – The verification process was initiated, but Amazon SES hasn't yet detected the DKIM records in the DNS configuration for the domain.
           
          * ``SUCCESS`` – The verification process completed successfully.
           
          * ``FAILED`` – The verification process failed. This typically occurs when Amazon SES fails to find the DKIM records in the DNS configuration of the domain.
           
          * ``TEMPORARY_FAILURE`` – A temporary issue is preventing Amazon SES from determining the DKIM authentication status of the domain.
           
          * ``NOT_STARTED`` – The DKIM verification process hasn't been initiated for the domain.
          

          
        

        - **Tokens** *(list) --* 

          If you used `Easy DKIM <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/easy-dkim.html>`__ to configure DKIM authentication for the domain, then this object contains a set of unique strings that you use to create a set of CNAME records that you add to the DNS configuration for your domain. When Amazon SES detects these records in the DNS configuration for your domain, the DKIM authentication process is complete.

           

          If you configured DKIM authentication for the domain by providing your own public-private key pair, then this object contains the selector for the public key.

           

          Regardless of the DKIM authentication method you use, Amazon SES searches for the appropriate records in the DNS configuration of the domain for up to 72 hours.

          
          

          - *(string) --* 
      
        

        - **SigningHostedZone** *(string) --* 

          The hosted zone where Amazon SES publishes the DKIM public key TXT records for this email identity. This value indicates the DNS zone that customers must reference when configuring their CNAME records for DKIM authentication.

           

          When configuring DKIM for your domain, create CNAME records in your DNS that point to the selectors in this hosted zone. For example:

           

          ``selector1._domainkey.yourdomain.com CNAME selector1.<SigningHostedZone>``

           

          ``selector2._domainkey.yourdomain.com CNAME selector2.<SigningHostedZone>``

           

          ``selector3._domainkey.yourdomain.com CNAME selector3.<SigningHostedZone>``

          
        

        - **SigningAttributesOrigin** *(string) --* 

          A string that indicates how DKIM was configured for the identity. These are the possible values:

           

          
          * ``AWS_SES`` – Indicates that DKIM was configured for the identity by using `Easy DKIM <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/easy-dkim.html>`__.

            For information about the syntax of sending authorization policies, see the `Amazon SES Developer Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/sending-authorization.html>`__.

            
    
  
      

      - **Tags** *(list) --* 

        An array of objects that define the tags (keys and values) that are associated with the email identity.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          An object that defines the tags that are associated with a resource. A *tag* is a label that you optionally define and associate with a resource. Tags can help you categorize and manage resources in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria. A resource can have as many as 50 tags.

           

          Each tag consists of a required *tag key* and an associated *tag value*, both of which you define. A tag key is a general label that acts as a category for a more specific tag value. A tag value acts as a descriptor within a tag key. A tag key can contain as many as 128 characters. A tag value can contain as many as 256 characters. The characters can be Unicode letters, digits, white space, or one of the following symbols: _ . : / = + -. The following additional restrictions apply to tags:

           

          
          * Tag keys and values are case sensitive.
           
          * For each associated resource, each tag key must be unique and it can have only one value.
           
          * The  ``aws:`` prefix is reserved for use by Amazon Web Services; you can’t use it in any tag keys or values that you define. In addition, you can't edit or remove tag keys or values that use this prefix. Tags that use this prefix don’t count against the limit of 50 tags per resource.
           
          * You can associate tags with public or shared resources, but the tags are available only for your Amazon Web Services account, not any other accounts that share the resource. In addition, the tags are available only for resources that are located in the specified Amazon Web Services Region for your Amazon Web Services account.
          

          
          

          - **Key** *(string) --* 

            One part of a key-value pair that defines a tag. The maximum length of a tag key is 128 characters. The minimum length is 1 character.

            
          

          - **Value** *(string) --* 

            The optional part of a key-value pair that defines a tag. The maximum length of a tag value is 256 characters. The minimum length is 0 characters. If you don't want a resource to have a specific tag value, don't specify a value for this parameter. If you don't specify a value, Amazon SES sets the value to an empty string.

            
      
    
      

      - **ConfigurationSetName** *(string) --* 

        The configuration set used by default when sending from this identity.

        
      

      - **VerificationStatus** *(string) --* 

        The verification status of the identity. The status can be one of the following:

         

        
        * ``PENDING`` – The verification process was initiated, but Amazon SES hasn't yet been able to verify the identity.
         
        * ``SUCCESS`` – The verification process completed successfully.
         
        * ``FAILED`` – The verification process failed.
         
        * ``TEMPORARY_FAILURE`` – A temporary issue is preventing Amazon SES from determining the verification status of the identity.
         
        * ``NOT_STARTED`` – The verification process hasn't been initiated for the identity.
        

        
      

      - **VerificationInfo** *(dict) --* 

        An object that contains additional information about the verification status for the identity.

        
        

        - **LastCheckedTimestamp** *(datetime) --* 

          The last time a verification attempt was made for this identity.

          
        

        - **LastSuccessTimestamp** *(datetime) --* 

          The last time a successful verification was made for this identity.

          
        

        - **ErrorType** *(string) --* 

          Provides the reason for the failure describing why Amazon SES was not able to successfully verify the identity. Below are the possible values:

           

          
          * ``INVALID_VALUE`` – Amazon SES was able to find the record, but the value contained within the record was invalid. Ensure you have published the correct values for the record.
           
          * ``TYPE_NOT_FOUND`` – The queried hostname exists but does not have the requested type of DNS record. Ensure that you have published the correct type of DNS record.
           
          * ``HOST_NOT_FOUND`` – The queried hostname does not exist or was not reachable at the time of the request. Ensure that you have published the required DNS record(s).
           
          * ``SERVICE_ERROR`` – A temporary issue is preventing Amazon SES from determining the verification status of the domain.
           
          * ``DNS_SERVER_ERROR`` – The DNS server encountered an issue and was unable to complete the request.
           
          * ``REPLICATION_ACCESS_DENIED`` – The verification failed because the user does not have the required permissions to replicate the DKIM key from the primary region. Ensure you have the necessary permissions in both primary and replica regions.
           
          * ``REPLICATION_PRIMARY_NOT_FOUND`` – The verification failed because no corresponding identity was found in the specified primary region. Ensure the identity exists in the primary region before attempting replication.
           
          * ``REPLICATION_PRIMARY_BYO_DKIM_NOT_SUPPORTED`` – The verification failed because the identity in the primary region is configured with Bring Your Own DKIM (BYODKIM). DKIM key replication is only supported for identities using Easy DKIM.
           
          * ``REPLICATION_REPLICA_AS_PRIMARY_NOT_SUPPORTED`` – The verification failed because the specified primary identity is a replica of another identity, and multi-level replication is not supported; the primary identity must be a non-replica identity.
           
          * ``REPLICATION_PRIMARY_INVALID_REGION`` – The verification failed due to an invalid primary region specified. Ensure you provide a valid Amazon Web Services region where Amazon SES is available and different from the replica region.
