    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 

      Information about the dedicated IP addresses that are associated with your Amazon Web Services account.

      
      

      - **DedicatedIps** *(list) --* 

        A list of dedicated IP addresses that are associated with your Amazon Web Services account.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          Contains information about a dedicated IP address that is associated with your Amazon SES account.

           

          To learn more about requesting dedicated IP addresses, see `Requesting and Relinquishing Dedicated IP Addresses <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/dedicated-ip-case.html>`__ in the *Amazon SES Developer Guide*.

          
          

          - **Ip** *(string) --* 

            An IPv4 address.

            
          

          - **WarmupStatus** *(string) --* 

            The warm-up status of a dedicated IP address. The status can have one of the following values:

             

            
            * ``IN_PROGRESS`` – The IP address isn't ready to use because the dedicated IP warm-up process is ongoing.
             
            * ``DONE`` – The dedicated IP warm-up process is complete, and the IP address is ready to use.
             
            * ``NOT_APPLICABLE`` – The warm-up status doesn't apply to this IP address. This status is used for IP addresses in managed dedicated IP pools, where Amazon SES automatically handles the warm-up process.
            

            
          

          - **WarmupPercentage** *(integer) --* 

            Indicates the progress of your dedicated IP warm-up:

             

            
            * ``0-100`` – For standard dedicated IP addresses, this shows the warm-up completion percentage. A value of 100 means the IP address is fully warmed up and ready for use.
             
            * ``-1`` – Appears for IP addresses in managed dedicated pools where Amazon SES automatically handles the warm-up process, making the percentage not applicable.
            

            
          

          - **PoolName** *(string) --* 

            The name of the dedicated IP pool that the IP address is associated with.

            
      
    
      

      - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

        A token that indicates that there are additional dedicated IP addresses to list. To view additional addresses, issue another request to ``GetDedicatedIps``, passing this token in the ``NextToken`` parameter.
