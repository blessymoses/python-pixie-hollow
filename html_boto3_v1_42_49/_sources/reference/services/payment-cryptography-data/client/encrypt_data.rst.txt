.. py:method:: PaymentCryptographyDataPlane.Client.encrypt_data(**kwargs)

  

  Encrypts plaintext data to ciphertext using a symmetric (TDES, AES), asymmetric (RSA), or derived (DUKPT or EMV) encryption key scheme. For more information, see `Encrypt data <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/userguide/encrypt-data.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide*.

   

  You can generate an encryption key within Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography by calling `CreateKey <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/APIReference/API_CreateKey.html>`__. You can import your own encryption key by calling `ImportKey <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/APIReference/API_ImportKey.html>`__.

   

  For this operation, the key must have ``KeyModesOfUse`` set to ``Encrypt``. In asymmetric encryption, plaintext is encrypted using public component. You can import the public component of an asymmetric key pair created outside Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography by calling `ImportKey <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/APIReference/API_ImportKey.html>`__.

   

  This operation also supports dynamic keys, allowing you to pass a dynamic encryption key as a TR-31 WrappedKeyBlock. This can be used when key material is frequently rotated, such as during every card transaction, and there is need to avoid importing short-lived keys into Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography. To encrypt using dynamic keys, the ``keyARN`` is the Key Encryption Key (KEK) of the TR-31 wrapped encryption key material. The incoming wrapped key shall have a key purpose of D0 with a mode of use of B or D. For more information, see `Using Dynamic Keys <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/userguide/use-cases-acquirers-dynamickeys.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide*.

   

  For symmetric and DUKPT encryption, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography supports ``TDES`` and ``AES`` algorithms. For EMV encryption, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography supports ``TDES`` algorithms.For asymmetric encryption, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography supports ``RSA``.

   

  When you use TDES or TDES DUKPT, the plaintext data length must be a multiple of 8 bytes. For AES or AES DUKPT, the plaintext data length must be a multiple of 16 bytes. For RSA, it sould be equal to the key size unless padding is enabled.

   

  To encrypt using DUKPT, you must already have a BDK (Base Derivation Key) key in your account with ``KeyModesOfUse`` set to ``DeriveKey``, or you can generate a new DUKPT key by calling `CreateKey <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/APIReference/API_CreateKey.html>`__. To encrypt using EMV, you must already have an IMK (Issuer Master Key) key in your account with ``KeyModesOfUse`` set to ``DeriveKey``.

   

  For information about valid keys for this operation, see `Understanding key attributes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/userguide/keys-validattributes.html>`__ and `Key types for specific data operations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/userguide/crypto-ops-validkeys-ops.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide*.

   

  **Cross-account use**: This operation can't be used across different Amazon Web Services accounts.

For AES keys, the KCV is computed using a CMAC algorithm where the input data is 16 bytes of zero and retaining the 3 highest order bytes of the encrypted result.
