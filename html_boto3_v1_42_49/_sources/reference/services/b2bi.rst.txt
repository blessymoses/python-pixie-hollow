.. py:class:: B2BI.Client

  A low-level client representing AWS B2B Data Interchange (B2BI)
  

  This is the *Amazon Web Services B2B Data Interchange API Reference*. It provides descriptions, API request parameters, and the XML response for each of the B2BI API actions.

   

  B2BI enables automated exchange of EDI (electronic data interchange) based business-critical transactions at cloud scale, with elasticity and pay-as-you-go pricing. Businesses use EDI documents to exchange transactional data with trading partners, such as suppliers and end customers, using standardized formats such as X12.

   

  .. note::

    

    Rather than actually running a command, you can use the ``--generate-cli-skeleton`` parameter with any API call to generate and display a parameter template. You can then use the generated template to customize and use as input on a later command. For details, see `Generate and use a parameter skeleton file <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-skeleton.html#cli-usage-skeleton-generate>`__.
