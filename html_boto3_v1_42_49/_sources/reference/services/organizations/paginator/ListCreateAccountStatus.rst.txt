      - *(dict) --* 
        

        - **CreateAccountStatuses** *(list) --* 

          A list of objects with details about the requests. Certain elements, such as the accountId number, are present in the output only after the account has been successfully created.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            Contains the status about a  CreateAccount or  CreateGovCloudAccount request to create an Amazon Web Services account or an Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) account in an organization.

            
            

            - **Id** *(string) --* 

              The unique identifier (ID) that references this request. You get this value from the response of the initial  CreateAccount request to create the account.

               

              The `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ for a create account request ID string requires "car-" followed by from 8 to 32 lowercase letters or digits.

              
            

            - **AccountName** *(string) --* 

              The account name given to the account when it was created.

              The date and time that the request was made for the account creation.

              
            

            - **CompletedTimestamp** *(datetime) --* 

              The date and time that the account was created and the request completed.

              
            

            - **AccountId** *(string) --* 

              If the account was created successfully, the unique identifier (ID) of the new account.

               

              The `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ for an account ID string requires exactly 12 digits.

              
            

            - **GovCloudAccountId** *(string) --* 

              If the account was created successfully, the ID for the new account in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region.

              
            

            - **FailureReason** *(string) --* 

              If the request failed, a description of the reason for the failure.
