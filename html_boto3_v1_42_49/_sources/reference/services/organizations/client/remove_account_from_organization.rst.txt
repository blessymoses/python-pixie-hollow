.. py:method:: Organizations.Client.remove_account_from_organization(**kwargs)

  

  Removes the specified account from the organization.

   

  The removed account becomes a standalone account that isn't a member of any organization. It's no longer subject to any policies and is responsible for its own bill payments. The organization's management account is no longer charged for any expenses accrued by the member account after it's removed from the organization.

   

  You can only call this operation from the management account. Member accounts can remove themselves with  LeaveOrganization instead.

   

  .. warning::

     

    
    * You can remove an account from your organization only if the account is configured with the information required to operate as a standalone account. When you create an account in an organization using the Organizations console, API, or CLI commands, the information required of standalone accounts is *not* automatically collected. For more information, see `Considerations before removing an account from an organization <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_account-before-remove.html>`__ in the *Organizations User Guide*.
     
    * The account that you want to leave must not be a delegated administrator account for any Amazon Web Services service enabled for your organization. If the account is a delegated administrator, you must first change the delegated administrator account to another account that is remaining in the organization.
     
    * After the account leaves the organization, all tags that were attached to the account object in the organization are deleted. Amazon Web Services accounts outside of an organization do not support tags.
