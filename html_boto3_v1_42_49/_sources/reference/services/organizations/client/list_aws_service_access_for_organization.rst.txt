.. py:method:: Organizations.Client.list_aws_service_access_for_organization(**kwargs)

  

  Returns a list of the Amazon Web Services services that you enabled to integrate with your organization. After a service on this list creates the resources that it requires for the integration, it can perform operations on your organization and its accounts.

   

  For more information about integrating other services with Organizations, including the list of services that currently work with Organizations, see `Using Organizations with other Amazon Web Services services <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_integrate_services.html>`__ in the *Organizations User Guide*.

   

  You can only call this operation from the management account or a member account that is a delegated administrator.
