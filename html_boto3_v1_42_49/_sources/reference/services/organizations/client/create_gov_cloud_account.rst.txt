.. py:method:: Organizations.Client.create_gov_cloud_account(**kwargs)

  

  This action is available if all of the following are true:

   

  
  * You're authorized to create accounts in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region. For more information on the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region, see the `Amazon Web Services GovCloud User Guide. <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/latest/UserGuide/welcome.html>`__
   
  * You already have an account in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region that is paired with a management account of an organization in the commercial Region.
   
  * You call this action from the management account of your organization in the commercial Region.
   
  * You have the ``organizations:CreateGovCloudAccount`` permission.
  

   

  Organizations automatically creates the required service-linked role named ``AWSServiceRoleForOrganizations``. For more information, see `Organizations and service-linked roles <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_integrate_services.html#orgs_integrate_services-using_slrs>`__ in the *Organizations User Guide*.

   

  Amazon Web Services automatically enables CloudTrail for Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) accounts, but you should also do the following:

   

  
  * Verify that CloudTrail is enabled to store logs.
   
  * Create an Amazon S3 bucket for CloudTrail log storage. For more information, see `Verifying CloudTrail Is Enabled <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/latest/UserGuide/verifying-cloudtrail.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services GovCloud User Guide*.
  

   

  If the request includes tags, then the requester must have the ``organizations:TagResource`` permission. The tags are attached to the commercial account associated with the GovCloud account, rather than the GovCloud account itself. To add tags to the GovCloud account, call the  TagResource operation in the GovCloud Region after the new GovCloud account exists.

   

  You call this action from the management account of your organization in the commercial Region to create a standalone Amazon Web Services account in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region. After the account is created, the management account of an organization in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region can invite it to that organization. For more information on inviting standalone accounts in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) to join an organization, see `Organizations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/latest/UserGuide/govcloud-organizations.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services GovCloud User Guide*.

   

  Calling ``CreateGovCloudAccount`` is an asynchronous request that Amazon Web Services performs in the background. Because ``CreateGovCloudAccount`` operates asynchronously, it can return a successful completion message even though account initialization might still be in progress. You might need to wait a few minutes before you can successfully access the account. To check the status of the request, do one of the following:

   

  
  * Use the ``OperationId`` response element from this operation to provide as a parameter to the  DescribeCreateAccountStatus operation.
   
  * Check the CloudTrail log for the ``CreateAccountResult`` event. For information on using CloudTrail with Organizations, see `Logging and monitoring in Organizations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_security_incident-response.html>`__ in the *Organizations User Guide*.
  

   

  

   

  When you call the ``CreateGovCloudAccount`` action, you create two accounts: a standalone account in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region and an associated account in the commercial Region for billing and support purposes. The account in the commercial Region is automatically a member of the organization whose credentials made the request. Both accounts are associated with the same email address.

   

  A role is created in the new account in the commercial Region that allows the management account in the organization in the commercial Region to assume it. An Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) account is then created and associated with the commercial account that you just created. A role is also created in the new Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) account that can be assumed by the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) account that is associated with the management account of the commercial organization. For more information and to view a diagram that explains how account access works, see `Organizations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/latest/UserGuide/govcloud-organizations.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services GovCloud User Guide*.

   

  For more information about creating accounts, see `Creating a member account in your organization <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_create.html>`__ in the *Organizations User Guide*.

   

  .. warning::

     

    
    * When you create an account in an organization using the Organizations console, API, or CLI commands, the information required for the account to operate as a standalone account is *not* automatically collected. This includes a payment method and signing the end user license agreement (EULA). If you must remove an account from your organization later, you can do so only after you provide the missing information. For more information, see `Considerations before removing an account from an organization <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_account-before-remove.html>`__ in the *Organizations User Guide*.
     
    * If you get an exception that indicates that you exceeded your account limits for the organization, contact `Amazon Web Services Support <https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/>`__.
     
    * If you get an exception that indicates that the operation failed because your organization is still initializing, wait one hour and then try again. If the error persists, contact `Amazon Web Services Support <https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/>`__.
     
    * Using ``CreateGovCloudAccount`` to create multiple temporary accounts isn't recommended. You can only close an account from the Amazon Web Services Billing and Cost Management console, and you must be signed in as the root user. For information on the requirements and process for closing an account, see `Closing a member account in your organization <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_close.html>`__ in the *Organizations User Guide*.
    

     

   

  .. note::

    

    When you create a member account with this operation, you can choose whether to create the account with the **IAM User and Role Access to Billing Information** switch enabled. If you enable it, IAM users and roles that have appropriate permissions can view billing information for the account. If you disable it, only the account root user can access billing information. For information about how to disable this switch for an account, see `Granting access to your billing information and tools <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/grantaccess.html>`__.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.create_gov_cloud_account(
        Email='string',
        AccountName='string',
        RoleName='string',
        IamUserAccessToBilling='ALLOW'|'DENY',
        Tags=[
            {
                'Key': 'string',
                'Value': 'string'
            },
        ]
    )
    
  :type Email: string
  :param Email: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies the email address of the owner to assign to the new member account in the commercial Region. This email address must not already be associated with another Amazon Web Services account. You must use a valid email address to complete account creation.

     

    The rules for a valid email address:

     

    
    * The address must be a minimum of 6 and a maximum of 64 characters long.
     
    * All characters must be 7-bit ASCII characters.
     
    * There must be one and only one @ symbol, which separates the local name from the domain name.
     
    * The local name can't contain any of the following characters: whitespace, " ' ( ) < > [ ] : ; , \ | % &
     
    * The local name can't begin with a dot (.)
     
    * The domain name can consist of only the characters [a-z],[A-Z],[0-9], hyphen (-), or dot (.)
     
    * The domain name can't begin or end with a hyphen (-) or dot (.)
     
    * The domain name must contain at least one dot
    

     

    You can't access the root user of the account or remove an account that was created with an invalid email address. Like all request parameters for ``CreateGovCloudAccount``, the request for the email address for the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) account originates from the commercial Region, not from the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region.

    

  
  :type AccountName: string
  :param AccountName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The friendly name of the member account.

     

    The account name can consist of only the characters [a-z],[A-Z],[0-9], hyphen (-), or dot (.) You can't separate characters with a dash (–).

    

  
  :type RoleName: string
  :param RoleName: 

    (Optional)

     

    The name of an IAM role that Organizations automatically preconfigures in the new member accounts in both the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region and in the commercial Region. This role trusts the management account, allowing users in the management account to assume the role, as permitted by the management account administrator. The role has administrator permissions in the new member account.

     

    If you don't specify this parameter, the role name defaults to ``OrganizationAccountAccessRole``.

     

    For more information about how to use this role to access the member account, see the following links:

     

    
    * `Creating the OrganizationAccountAccessRole in an invited member account <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_access.html#orgs_manage_accounts_create-cross-account-role>`__ in the *Organizations User Guide*
     
    * Steps 2 and 3 in `IAM Tutorial\: Delegate access across Amazon Web Services accounts using IAM roles <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_cross-account-with-roles.html>`__ in the *IAM User Guide*
    

     

    The `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ that is used to validate this parameter. The pattern can include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits with no spaces, and any of the following characters: =,.@-

    

  
  :type IamUserAccessToBilling: string
  :param IamUserAccessToBilling: 

    If set to ``ALLOW``, the new linked account in the commercial Region enables IAM users to access account billing information *if* they have the required permissions. If set to ``DENY``, only the root user of the new account can access account billing information. For more information, see `About IAM access to the Billing and Cost Management console <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/grantaccess.html#ControllingAccessWebsite-Activate>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services Billing and Cost Management User Guide*.

     

    If you don't specify this parameter, the value defaults to ``ALLOW``, and IAM users and roles with the required permissions can access billing information for the new account.

    

  
  :type Tags: list
  :param Tags: 

    A list of tags that you want to attach to the newly created account. These tags are attached to the commercial account associated with the GovCloud account, and not to the GovCloud account itself. To add tags to the actual GovCloud account, call the  TagResource operation in the GovCloud region after the new GovCloud account exists.

     

    For each tag in the list, you must specify both a tag key and a value. You can set the value to an empty string, but you can't set it to ``null``. For more information about tagging, see `Tagging Organizations resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_tagging.html>`__ in the Organizations User Guide.

     

    .. note::

      

      If any one of the tags is not valid or if you exceed the maximum allowed number of tags for an account, then the entire request fails and the account is not created.

      

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      A custom key-value pair associated with a resource within your organization.

       

      You can attach tags to any of the following organization resources.

       

      
      * Amazon Web Services account
       
      * Organizational unit (OU)
       
      * Organization root
       
      * Policy
      

      

    
      - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The key identifier, or name, of the tag.

        

      
      - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The string value that's associated with the key of the tag. You can set the value of a tag to an empty string, but you can't set the value of a tag to null.
