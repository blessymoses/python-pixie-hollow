.. py:method:: Organizations.Client.close_account(**kwargs)

  

  Closes an Amazon Web Services member account within an organization. You can close an account when `all features are enabled <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_org_support-all-features.html>`__. You can't close the management account with this API. This is an asynchronous request that Amazon Web Services performs in the background. Because ``CloseAccount`` operates asynchronously, it can return a successful completion message even though account closure might still be in progress. You need to wait a few minutes before the account is fully closed. To check the status of the request, do one of the following:

   

  
  * Use the ``AccountId`` that you sent in the ``CloseAccount`` request to provide as a parameter to the  DescribeAccount operation. While the close account request is in progress, Account status will indicate PENDING_CLOSURE. When the close account request completes, the status will change to SUSPENDED.
   
  * Check the CloudTrail log for the ``CloseAccountResult`` event that gets published after the account closes successfully. For information on using CloudTrail with Organizations, see `Logging and monitoring in Organizations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_security_incident-response.html#orgs_cloudtrail-integration>`__ in the *Organizations User Guide*.
  

   

  .. note::

    

    
    * Resources remaining within the account after closing will be automatically deleted after 90 days. During this 90-day period, the resources won't be available unless you contact Amazon Web Services Support to reopen the account. After 90 days, you can't reopen an account. You might still receive a `bill after account closure <https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/closed-account-bill>`__.
     
    * You can close only 10% of member accounts, between 10 and 1000, within a rolling 30 day period. This quota is not bound by a calendar month, but starts when you close an account. After you reach this limit, you can't close additional accounts. For more information, see `Closing a member account in your organization <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_close.html>`__ and `Quotas for Organizations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_reference_limits.html>`__ in the *Organizations User Guide*.
     
    * To reinstate a closed account, contact Amazon Web Services Support within the 90-day grace period while the account is in SUSPENDED status.
     
    * If the Amazon Web Services account you attempt to close is linked to an Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) account, the ``CloseAccount`` request will close both accounts. To learn important pre-closure details, see `Closing an Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) account <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/latest/UserGuide/Closing-govcloud-account.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services GovCloud User Guide*.
