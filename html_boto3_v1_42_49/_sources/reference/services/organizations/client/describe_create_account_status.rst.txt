  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.describe_create_account_status(
        CreateAccountRequestId='string'
    )
    
  :type CreateAccountRequestId: string
  :param CreateAccountRequestId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies the ``Id`` value that uniquely identifies the ``CreateAccount`` request. You can get the value from the ``CreateAccountStatus.Id`` response in an earlier  CreateAccount request, or from the  ListCreateAccountStatus operation.

          * ACCOUNT_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: The account couldn't be created because you reached the limit on the number of accounts in your organization.
           
          * CONCURRENT_ACCOUNT_MODIFICATION: You already submitted a request with the same information.
           
          * EMAIL_ALREADY_EXISTS: The account could not be created because another Amazon Web Services account with that email address already exists.
           
          * FAILED_BUSINESS_VALIDATION: The Amazon Web Services account that owns your organization failed to receive business license validation.
           
          * GOVCLOUD_ACCOUNT_ALREADY_EXISTS: The account in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region could not be created because this Region already includes an account with that email address.

  **Examples**

  The following example shows how to request the status about a previous request to create an account in an organization. This operation can be called only by a principal from the organization's master account. In the example, the specified "createAccountRequestId" comes from the response of the original call to "CreateAccount":
  ::

    response = client.describe_create_account_status(
        CreateAccountRequestId='car-exampleaccountcreationrequestid',
    )
    
    print(response)

  
  Expected Output:
  ::

    {
        'CreateAccountStatus': {
            'AccountId': '333333333333',
            'Id': 'car-exampleaccountcreationrequestid',
            'State': 'SUCCEEDED',
        },
        'ResponseMetadata': {
            '...': '...',
        },
    }
