  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_delegated_administrators(
        ServicePrincipal='string',
        NextToken='string',
        MaxResults=123
    )
    
  :type ServicePrincipal: string
  :param ServicePrincipal: 

    Specifies a service principal name. If specified, then the operation lists the delegated administrators only for the specified service.

     

    If you don't specify a service principal, the operation lists all delegated administrators for all services in your organization.

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    The parameter for receiving additional results if you receive a ``NextToken`` response in a previous request. A ``NextToken`` response indicates that more output is available. Set this parameter to the value of the previous call's ``NextToken`` response to indicate where the output should continue from.

    

  
  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    The maximum number of items to return in the response. If more results exist than the specified ``MaxResults`` value, a token is included in the response so that you can retrieve the remaining results.
