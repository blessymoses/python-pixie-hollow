.. py:method:: Organizations.Client.create_organization(**kwargs)

  

  Creates an Amazon Web Services organization. The account whose user is calling the ``CreateOrganization`` operation automatically becomes the `management account <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_getting-started_concepts.html#account>`__ of the new organization.

   

  This operation must be called using credentials from the account that is to become the new organization's management account. The principal must also have the relevant IAM permissions.

   

  By default (or if you set the ``FeatureSet`` parameter to ``ALL``), the new organization is created with all features enabled and service control policies automatically enabled in the root. If you instead choose to create the organization supporting only the consolidated billing features by setting the ``FeatureSet`` parameter to ``CONSOLIDATED_BILLING``, no policy types are enabled by default and you can't use organization policies.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.create_organization(
        FeatureSet='ALL'|'CONSOLIDATED_BILLING'
    )
    
  :type FeatureSet: string
  :param FeatureSet: 

    Specifies the feature set supported by the new organization. Each feature set supports different levels of functionality.

     

    
    * ``CONSOLIDATED_BILLING``: All member accounts have their bills consolidated to and paid by the management account. For more information, see `Consolidated billing <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_getting-started_concepts.html#feature-set-cb-only>`__ in the *Organizations User Guide*. The consolidated billing feature subset isn't available for organizations in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region.
     
    * ``ALL``: In addition to all the features supported by the consolidated billing feature set, the management account can also apply any policy type to any member account in the organization. For more information, see `All features <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_getting-started_concepts.html#feature-set-all>`__ in the *Organizations User Guide*.

  **Examples**

  Bill wants to create an organization using credentials from account 111111111111. The following example shows that the account becomes the master account in the new organization. Because he does not specify a feature set, the new organization defaults to all features enabled and service control policies enabled on the root:


  ::

    response = client.create_organization(
    )
    
    print(response)

  
  Expected Output:
  ::

    {
        'Organization': {
            'Arn': 'arn:aws:organizations::111111111111:organization/o-exampleorgid',
            'AvailablePolicyTypes': [
                {
                    'Status': 'ENABLED',
                    'Type': 'SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY',
                },
            ],
            'FeatureSet': 'ALL',
            'Id': 'o-exampleorgid',
            'MasterAccountArn': 'arn:aws:organizations::111111111111:account/o-exampleorgid/111111111111',
            'MasterAccountEmail': 'bill@example.com',
            'MasterAccountId': '111111111111',
        },
        'ResponseMetadata': {
            '...': '...',
        },
    }

  

  In the following example, Bill creates an organization using credentials from account 111111111111, and configures the organization to support only the consolidated billing feature set:


  ::

    response = client.create_organization(
        FeatureSet='CONSOLIDATED_BILLING',
    )
    
    print(response)

  
  Expected Output:
  ::

    {
        'Organization': {
            'Arn': 'arn:aws:organizations::111111111111:organization/o-exampleorgid',
            'AvailablePolicyTypes': [
            ],
            'FeatureSet': 'CONSOLIDATED_BILLING',
            'Id': 'o-exampleorgid',
            'MasterAccountArn': 'arn:aws:organizations::111111111111:account/o-exampleorgid/111111111111',
            'MasterAccountEmail': 'bill@example.com',
            'MasterAccountId': '111111111111',
        },
        'ResponseMetadata': {
            '...': '...',
        },
    }
