    - **Id** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      ID for the participant: Acccount ID, organization ID, or email address.

       

      The `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`__ for handshake ID string requires "h-" followed by from 8 to 32 lowercase letters or digits.

      

    
    - **Type** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The type of ID for the participant.

  :type SourceName: string
  :param SourceName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Name you want to assign to the transfer.

    

  
  :type Tags: list
  :param Tags: 

    A list of tags that you want to attach to the transfer. For each tag in the list, you must specify both a tag key and a value. You can set the value to an empty string, but you can't set it to ``null``. For more information about tagging, see `Tagging Organizations resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_tagging.html>`__ in the Organizations User Guide.

     

    .. warning::

       

      Any tags in the request are checked for compliance with any applicable tag policies when the request is made. The request is rejected if the tags in the request don't match the requirements of the policy at that time. Tag policy compliance is **not** checked again when the invitation is accepted and the tags are actually attached to the transfer. That means that if the tag policy changes between the invitation and the acceptance, then that tags could potentially be non-compliant.

       

     

    .. note::

      

      If any one of the tags is not valid or if you exceed the allowed number of tags for a transfer, then the entire request fails and invitations are not sent.

      

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      A custom key-value pair associated with a resource within your organization.

       

      You can attach tags to any of the following organization resources.

       

      
      * Amazon Web Services account
       
      * Organizational unit (OU)
       
      * Organization root
       
      * Policy
      

      

    
      - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The key identifier, or name, of the tag.

        

      
      - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**
