.. py:attribute:: S3.BucketNotification.queue_configurations

  

  - *(list) --* 

    The Amazon Simple Queue Service queues to publish messages to and the events for which to publish messages.

    
    

    - *(dict) --* 

      Specifies the configuration for publishing messages to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue when Amazon S3 detects specified events.

      
      

      - **Id** *(string) --* 

        An optional unique identifier for configurations in a notification configuration. If you don't provide one, Amazon S3 will assign an ID.

        
      

      - **QueueArn** *(string) --* 

        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon SQS queue to which Amazon S3 publishes a message when it detects events of the specified type.

        
      

      - **Events** *(list) --* 

        A collection of bucket events for which to send notifications

        
        

        - *(string) --* 

          The bucket event for which to send notifications.

          
    
      

      - **Filter** *(dict) --* 

        Specifies object key name filtering rules. For information about key name filtering, see `Configuring event notifications using object key name filtering <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/notification-how-to-filtering.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

        
        

        - **Key** *(dict) --* 

          A container for object key name prefix and suffix filtering rules.

          
          

          - **FilterRules** *(list) --* 

            A list of containers for the key-value pair that defines the criteria for the filter rule.

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

              Specifies the Amazon S3 object key name to filter on. An object key name is the name assigned to an object in your Amazon S3 bucket. You specify whether to filter on the suffix or prefix of the object key name. A prefix is a specific string of characters at the beginning of an object key name, which you can use to organize objects. For example, you can start the key names of related objects with a prefix, such as ``2023-`` or ``engineering/``. Then, you can use ``FilterRule`` to find objects in a bucket with key names that have the same prefix. A suffix is similar to a prefix, but it is at the end of the object key name instead of at the beginning.

              
              

              - **Name** *(string) --* 

                The object key name prefix or suffix identifying one or more objects to which the filtering rule applies. The maximum length is 1,024 characters. Overlapping prefixes and suffixes are not supported. For more information, see `Configuring Event Notifications <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

                
              

              - **Value** *(string) --* 

                The value that the filter searches for in object key names.
