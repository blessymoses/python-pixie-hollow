    :type MaxParts: integer
    :param MaxParts: 

      Sets the maximum number of parts to return.

      

    
    :type PartNumberMarker: integer
    :param PartNumberMarker: 

      Specifies the part after which listing should begin. Only parts with higher part numbers will be listed.

      

    
    :type RequestPayer: string
    :param RequestPayer: 

      Confirms that the requester knows that they will be charged for the request. Bucket owners need not specify this parameter in their requests. If either the source or destination S3 bucket has Requester Pays enabled, the requester will pay for the corresponding charges. For information about downloading objects from Requester Pays buckets, see `Downloading Objects in Requester Pays Buckets <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ObjectsinRequesterPaysBuckets.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

    :type ExpectedBucketOwner: string
    :param ExpectedBucketOwner: 

      The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that you provide does not match the actual owner of the bucket, the request fails with the HTTP status code ``403 Forbidden`` (access denied).

      

    
    :type SSECustomerAlgorithm: string
    :param SSECustomerAlgorithm: 

      The server-side encryption (SSE) algorithm used to encrypt the object. This parameter is needed only when the object was created using a checksum algorithm.

    :param SSECustomerKey: 

      The server-side encryption (SSE) customer managed key. This parameter is needed only when the object was created using a checksum algorithm.
