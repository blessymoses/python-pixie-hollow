  - *(list) --* 

    Container for a lifecycle rule.

    
    

    - *(dict) --* 

      A lifecycle rule for individual objects in an Amazon S3 bucket.

       

      For more information see, `Managing your storage lifecycle <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

      
      

      - **Expiration** *(dict) --* 

        Specifies the expiration for the lifecycle of the object in the form of date, days and, whether the object has a delete marker.

        
        

        - **Date** *(datetime) --* 

          Indicates at what date the object is to be moved or deleted. The date value must conform to the ISO 8601 format. The time is always midnight UTC.

           

          .. note::

            

            This parameter applies to general purpose buckets only. It is not supported for directory bucket lifecycle configurations.

            

          
        

        - **Days** *(integer) --* 

          Indicates the lifetime, in days, of the objects that are subject to the rule. The value must be a non-zero positive integer.

          
        

        - **ExpiredObjectDeleteMarker** *(boolean) --* 

          Indicates whether Amazon S3 will remove a delete marker with no noncurrent versions. If set to true, the delete marker will be expired; if set to false the policy takes no action. This cannot be specified with Days or Date in a Lifecycle Expiration Policy.

           

          .. note::

            

            This parameter applies to general purpose buckets only. It is not supported for directory bucket lifecycle configurations.

            

          
    
      

      - **ID** *(string) --* 

        Unique identifier for the rule. The value cannot be longer than 255 characters.

        
      

      - **Prefix** *(string) --* 

        The general purpose bucket prefix that identifies one or more objects to which the rule applies. We recommend using ``Filter`` instead of ``Prefix`` for new PUTs. Previous configurations where a prefix is defined will continue to operate as before.

         

        .. warning::

           

          Replacement must be made for object keys containing special characters (such as carriage returns) when using XML requests. For more information, see `XML related object key constraints <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-keys.html#object-key-xml-related-constraints>`__.

          

        
      

      - **Filter** *(dict) --* 

        The ``Filter`` is used to identify objects that a Lifecycle Rule applies to. A ``Filter`` must have exactly one of ``Prefix``, ``Tag``, ``ObjectSizeGreaterThan``, ``ObjectSizeLessThan``, or ``And`` specified. ``Filter`` is required if the ``LifecycleRule`` does not contain a ``Prefix`` element.

         

        For more information about ``Tag`` filters, see `Adding filters to Lifecycle rules <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/intro-lifecycle-filters.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

         

        .. note::

          

          ``Tag`` filters are not supported for directory buckets.

          

        
        

        - **Prefix** *(string) --* 

          Prefix identifying one or more objects to which the rule applies.

          - **Prefix** *(string) --* 

            Prefix identifying one or more objects to which the rule applies.

      - **Transitions** *(list) --* 

        Specifies when an Amazon S3 object transitions to a specified storage class.

         

        .. note::

          

          This parameter applies to general purpose buckets only. It is not supported for directory bucket lifecycle configurations.

          

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          Specifies when an object transitions to a specified storage class. For more information about Amazon S3 lifecycle configuration rules, see `Transitioning Objects Using Amazon S3 Lifecycle <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/lifecycle-transition-general-considerations.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

          
          

          - **Date** *(datetime) --* 

            Indicates when objects are transitioned to the specified storage class. The date value must be in ISO 8601 format. The time is always midnight UTC.

            
          

          - **Days** *(integer) --* 

            Indicates the number of days after creation when objects are transitioned to the specified storage class. If the specified storage class is ``INTELLIGENT_TIERING``, ``GLACIER_IR``, ``GLACIER``, or ``DEEP_ARCHIVE``, valid values are ``0`` or positive integers. If the specified storage class is ``STANDARD_IA`` or ``ONEZONE_IA``, valid values are positive integers greater than ``30``. Be aware that some storage classes have a minimum storage duration and that you're charged for transitioning objects before their minimum storage duration. For more information, see `Constraints and considerations for transitions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/lifecycle-transition-general-considerations.html#lifecycle-configuration-constraints>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

            The storage class to which you want the object to transition.

            
      
    
      

      - **NoncurrentVersionTransitions** *(list) --* 

        Specifies the transition rule for the lifecycle rule that describes when noncurrent objects transition to a specific storage class. If your bucket is versioning-enabled (or versioning is suspended), you can set this action to request that Amazon S3 transition noncurrent object versions to a specific storage class at a set period in the object's lifetime.

         

        .. note::

          

          This parameter applies to general purpose buckets only. It is not supported for directory bucket lifecycle configurations.

          

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          Container for the transition rule that describes when noncurrent objects transition to the ``STANDARD_IA``, ``ONEZONE_IA``, ``INTELLIGENT_TIERING``, ``GLACIER_IR``, ``GLACIER``, or ``DEEP_ARCHIVE`` storage class. If your bucket is versioning-enabled (or versioning is suspended), you can set this action to request that Amazon S3 transition noncurrent object versions to the ``STANDARD_IA``, ``ONEZONE_IA``, ``INTELLIGENT_TIERING``, ``GLACIER_IR``, ``GLACIER``, or ``DEEP_ARCHIVE`` storage class at a specific period in the object's lifetime.

          
          

          - **NoncurrentDays** *(integer) --* 

            Specifies the number of days an object is noncurrent before Amazon S3 can perform the associated action. For information about the noncurrent days calculations, see `How Amazon S3 Calculates How Long an Object Has Been Noncurrent <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/intro-lifecycle-rules.html#non-current-days-calculations>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

            
          

          - **StorageClass** *(string) --* 

            The class of storage used to store the object.

            
          

          - **NewerNoncurrentVersions** *(integer) --* 

            Specifies how many noncurrent versions Amazon S3 will retain in the same storage class before transitioning objects. You can specify up to 100 noncurrent versions to retain. Amazon S3 will transition any additional noncurrent versions beyond the specified number to retain. For more information about noncurrent versions, see `Lifecycle configuration elements <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/intro-lifecycle-rules.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

            
      
    
      

      - **NoncurrentVersionExpiration** *(dict) --* 

        Specifies when noncurrent object versions expire. Upon expiration, Amazon S3 permanently deletes the noncurrent object versions. You set this lifecycle configuration action on a bucket that has versioning enabled (or suspended) to request that Amazon S3 delete noncurrent object versions at a specific period in the object's lifetime.

         

        .. note::

          

          This parameter applies to general purpose buckets only. It is not supported for directory bucket lifecycle configurations.

          

        
        

        - **NoncurrentDays** *(integer) --* 

          Specifies the number of days an object is noncurrent before Amazon S3 can perform the associated action. The value must be a non-zero positive integer.

        - **NewerNoncurrentVersions** *(integer) --* 

          Specifies how many noncurrent versions Amazon S3 will retain. You can specify up to 100 noncurrent versions to retain.
