.. py:method:: S3.ObjectVersion.head(**kwargs)

  

  The ``HEAD`` operation retrieves metadata from an object without returning the object itself. This operation is useful if you're interested only in an object's metadata.

   

  .. note::

    

    A ``HEAD`` request has the same options as a ``GET`` operation on an object. The response is identical to the ``GET`` response except that there is no response body. Because of this, if the ``HEAD`` request generates an error, it returns a generic code, such as ``400 Bad Request``, ``403 Forbidden``, ``404 Not Found``, ``405 Method Not Allowed``, ``412 Precondition Failed``, or ``304 Not Modified``. It's not possible to retrieve the exact exception of these error codes.

    

   

  Request headers are limited to 8 KB in size. For more information, see `Common Request Headers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTCommonRequestHeaders.html>`__.

    Permissions  

  

   

  
  * **General purpose bucket permissions** - To use ``HEAD``, you must have the ``s3:GetObject`` permission. You need the relevant read object (or version) permission for this operation. For more information, see `Actions, resources, and condition keys for Amazon S3 <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/list_amazons3.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*. For more information about the permissions to S3 API operations by S3 resource types, see `Required permissions for Amazon S3 API operations </AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-policy-actions.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*. If the object you request doesn't exist, the error that Amazon S3 returns depends on whether you also have the ``s3:ListBucket`` permission. 

    
    * If you have the ``s3:ListBucket`` permission on the bucket, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP status code ``404 Not Found`` error.
     
    * If you don’t have the ``s3:ListBucket`` permission, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP status code ``403 Forbidden`` error.
    

  
   
  * **Directory bucket permissions** - To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the `CreateSession <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html>`__ API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the ``s3express:CreateSession`` permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the ``CreateSession`` API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another ``CreateSession`` API call to generate a new session token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see `CreateSession <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html>`__. If you enable ``x-amz-checksum-mode`` in the request and the object is encrypted with Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (Amazon Web Services KMS), you must also have the ``kms:GenerateDataKey`` and ``kms:Decrypt`` permissions in IAM identity-based policies and KMS key policies for the KMS key to retrieve the checksum of the object.
  

    Encryption  

  .. note::

    

    Encryption request headers, like ``x-amz-server-side-encryption``, should not be sent for ``HEAD`` requests if your object uses server-side encryption with Key Management Service (KMS) keys (SSE-KMS), dual-layer server-side encryption with Amazon Web Services KMS keys (DSSE-KMS), or server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). The ``x-amz-server-side-encryption`` header is used when you ``PUT`` an object to S3 and want to specify the encryption method. If you include this header in a ``HEAD`` request for an object that uses these types of keys, you’ll get an HTTP ``400 Bad Request`` error. It's because the encryption method can't be changed when you retrieve the object.

    

   

  If you encrypt an object by using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) when you store the object in Amazon S3, then when you retrieve the metadata from the object, you must use the following headers to provide the encryption key for the server to be able to retrieve the object's metadata. The headers are:

   

  
  * ``x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm``
   
  * ``x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key``
   
  * ``x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5``
  

   

  For more information about SSE-C, see `Server-Side Encryption (Using Customer-Provided Encryption Keys) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ServerSideEncryptionCustomerKeys.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

   

  .. note::

    

    **Directory bucket** - For directory buckets, there are only two supported options for server-side encryption: SSE-S3 and SSE-KMS. SSE-C isn't supported. For more information, see `Protecting data with server-side encryption <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-serv-side-encryption.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

    

    Versioning  

  
  * If the current version of the object is a delete marker, Amazon S3 behaves as if the object was deleted and includes ``x-amz-delete-marker: true`` in the response.
   
  * If the specified version is a delete marker, the response returns a ``405 Method Not Allowed`` error and the ``Last-Modified: timestamp`` response header.
  

   

  .. note::

    

    
    * **Directory buckets** - Delete marker is not supported for directory buckets.
     
    * **Directory buckets** - S3 Versioning isn't enabled and supported for directory buckets. For this API operation, only the ``null`` value of the version ID is supported by directory buckets. You can only specify ``null`` to the ``versionId`` query parameter in the request.
    

    

    HTTP Host header syntax  

  **Directory buckets** - The HTTP Host header syntax is ``Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com``.

   

  .. note::

    

    For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format ``https://amzn-s3-demo-bucket.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com/key-name ``. Path-style requests are not supported. For more information about endpoints in Availability Zones, see `Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets in Availability Zones <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/endpoint-directory-buckets-AZ.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*. For more information about endpoints in Local Zones, see `Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-lzs-for-directory-buckets.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

    

     

  The following actions are related to ``HeadObject``:

   

  
  * `GetObject <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObject.html>`__
   
  * `GetObjectAttributes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObjectAttributes.html>`__
  

   

  .. warning::

     

    You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is ``my file.txt``, containing two spaces after ``my``, you must URL encode this value to ``my%20%20file.txt``.

    .. note::

      

      This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

      

    

  
  :type SSECustomerKey: string
  :param SSECustomerKey: 

    Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use in encrypting data. This value is used to store the object and then it is discarded; Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key. The key must be appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in the ``x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm`` header.

     

    .. note::

      

      This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

      

    

  
  :type SSECustomerKeyMD5: string
  :param SSECustomerKeyMD5: 

    Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC 1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check to ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.

     

    .. note::

      

      This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

      

        Please note that this parameter is automatically populated if it is not provided. Including this parameter is not required



  
  :type RequestPayer: string
  :param RequestPayer: 

    Confirms that the requester knows that they will be charged for the request. Bucket owners need not specify this parameter in their requests.

For information about downloading objects from Requester Pays buckets, see `Downloading Objects in Requester Pays Buckets <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ObjectsinRequesterPaysBuckets.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

     

    .. note::

      

      This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

      

    

  
  :type PartNumber: integer
  :param PartNumber: 

    Part number of the object being read. This is a positive integer between 1 and 10,000. Effectively performs a 'ranged' HEAD request for the part specified. Useful querying about the size of the part and the number of parts in this object.

    

  
  :type ExpectedBucketOwner: string
  :param ExpectedBucketOwner: 

    The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that you provide does not match the actual owner of the bucket, the request fails with the HTTP status code ``403 Forbidden`` (access denied).

    

  
  :type ChecksumMode: string
  :param ChecksumMode: 

    To retrieve the checksum, this parameter must be enabled.

     

    **General purpose buckets** - If you enable checksum mode and the object is uploaded with a `checksum <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_Checksum.html>`__ and encrypted with an Key Management Service (KMS) key, you must have permission to use the ``kms:Decrypt`` action to retrieve the checksum.

     

    **Directory buckets** - If you enable ``ChecksumMode`` and the object is encrypted with Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (Amazon Web Services KMS), you must also have the ``kms:GenerateDataKey`` and ``kms:Decrypt`` permissions in IAM identity-based policies and KMS key policies for the KMS key to retrieve the checksum of the object.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **DeleteMarker** *(boolean) --* 

        Specifies whether the object retrieved was (true) or was not (false) a Delete Marker. If false, this response header does not appear in the response.

         

        .. note::

          

          This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

          

        
      

      - **AcceptRanges** *(string) --* 

        Indicates that a range of bytes was specified.

        
      

      - **Expiration** *(string) --* 

        If the object expiration is configured (see `PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration.html>`__), the response includes this header. It includes the ``expiry-date`` and ``rule-id`` key-value pairs providing object expiration information. The value of the ``rule-id`` is URL-encoded.

         

        .. note::

          

          Object expiration information is not returned in directory buckets and this header returns the value " ``NotImplemented``" in all responses for directory buckets.

          

        
      

      - **Restore** *(string) --* 

        If the object is an archived object (an object whose storage class is GLACIER), the response includes this header if either the archive restoration is in progress (see `RestoreObject <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_RestoreObject.html>`__ or an archive copy is already restored.

         

        If an archive copy is already restored, the header value indicates when Amazon S3 is scheduled to delete the object copy. For example:

         

        ``x-amz-restore: ongoing-request="false", expiry-date="Fri, 21 Dec 2012 00:00:00 GMT"``

         

        If the object restoration is in progress, the header returns the value ``ongoing-request="true"``.

         

        For more information about archiving objects, see `Transitioning Objects\: General Considerations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html#lifecycle-transition-general-considerations>`__.

         

        .. note::

          

          This functionality is not supported for directory buckets. Directory buckets only support ``EXPRESS_ONEZONE`` (the S3 Express One Zone storage class) in Availability Zones and ``ONEZONE_IA`` (the S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access storage class) in Dedicated Local Zones.

          

        
      

      - **ArchiveStatus** *(string) --* 

        The archive state of the head object.

         

        .. note::

          

          This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

          

        
      

      - **LastModified** *(datetime) --* 

        Date and time when the object was last modified.

        
      

      - **ContentLength** *(integer) --* 

        Size of the body in bytes.

        
      

      - **ChecksumCRC32** *(string) --* 

        The Base64 encoded, 32-bit ``CRC32 checksum`` of the object. This checksum is only present if the checksum was uploaded with the object. When you use an API operation on an object that was uploaded using multipart uploads, this value may not be a direct checksum value of the full object. Instead, it's a calculation based on the checksum values of each individual part. For more information about how checksums are calculated with multipart uploads, see `Checking object integrity <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html#large-object-checksums>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

        
      

      - **ChecksumCRC32C** *(string) --* 

        The Base64 encoded, 32-bit ``CRC32C`` checksum of the object. This checksum is only present if the checksum was uploaded with the object. When you use an API operation on an object that was uploaded using multipart uploads, this value may not be a direct checksum value of the full object. Instead, it's a calculation based on the checksum values of each individual part. For more information about how checksums are calculated with multipart uploads, see `Checking object integrity <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html#large-object-checksums>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

        
      

      - **ChecksumCRC64NVME** *(string) --* 

        The Base64 encoded, 64-bit ``CRC64NVME`` checksum of the object. For more information, see `Checking object integrity in the Amazon S3 User Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html>`__.

        
      

      - **ChecksumSHA1** *(string) --* 

        The Base64 encoded, 160-bit ``SHA1`` digest of the object. This checksum is only present if the checksum was uploaded with the object. When you use the API operation on an object that was uploaded using multipart uploads, this value may not be a direct checksum value of the full object. Instead, it's a calculation based on the checksum values of each individual part. For more information about how checksums are calculated with multipart uploads, see `Checking object integrity <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html#large-object-checksums>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

        
      

      - **ChecksumSHA256** *(string) --* 

        The Base64 encoded, 256-bit ``SHA256`` digest of the object. This checksum is only present if the checksum was uploaded with the object. When you use an API operation on an object that was uploaded using multipart uploads, this value may not be a direct checksum value of the full object. Instead, it's a calculation based on the checksum values of each individual part. For more information about how checksums are calculated with multipart uploads, see `Checking object integrity <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html#large-object-checksums>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

        
      

      - **ChecksumType** *(string) --* 

        The checksum type, which determines how part-level checksums are combined to create an object-level checksum for multipart objects. You can use this header response to verify that the checksum type that is received is the same checksum type that was specified in ``CreateMultipartUpload`` request. For more information, see `Checking object integrity in the Amazon S3 User Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html>`__.

        
      

      - **ETag** *(string) --* 

        An entity tag (ETag) is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL.

        
      

      - **MissingMeta** *(integer) --* 

        This is set to the number of metadata entries not returned in ``x-amz-meta`` headers. This can happen if you create metadata using an API like SOAP that supports more flexible metadata than the REST API. For example, using SOAP, you can create metadata whose values are not legal HTTP headers.

         

        .. note::

      - **ReplicationStatus** *(string) --* 

        Amazon S3 can return this header if your request involves a bucket that is either a source or a destination in a replication rule.

         

        In replication, you have a source bucket on which you configure replication and destination bucket or buckets where Amazon S3 stores object replicas. When you request an object ( ``GetObject``) or object metadata ( ``HeadObject``) from these buckets, Amazon S3 will return the ``x-amz-replication-status`` header in the response as follows:

         

        
        * **If requesting an object from the source bucket**, Amazon S3 will return the ``x-amz-replication-status`` header if the object in your request is eligible for replication. For example, suppose that in your replication configuration, you specify object prefix ``TaxDocs`` requesting Amazon S3 to replicate objects with key prefix ``TaxDocs``. Any objects you upload with this key name prefix, for example ``TaxDocs/document1.pdf``, are eligible for replication. For any object request with this key name prefix, Amazon S3 will return the ``x-amz-replication-status`` header with value PENDING, COMPLETED or FAILED indicating object replication status.
         
        * **If requesting an object from a destination bucket**, Amazon S3 will return the ``x-amz-replication-status`` header with value REPLICA if the object in your request is a replica that Amazon S3 created and there is no replica modification replication in progress.
         
        * **When replicating objects to multiple destination buckets**, the ``x-amz-replication-status`` header acts differently. The header of the source object will only return a value of COMPLETED when replication is successful to all destinations. The header will remain at value PENDING until replication has completed for all destinations. If one or more destinations fails replication the header will return FAILED.

      - **PartsCount** *(integer) --* 

        The count of parts this object has. This value is only returned if you specify ``partNumber`` in your request and the object was uploaded as a multipart upload.

        
      

      - **TagCount** *(integer) --* 

        The number of tags, if any, on the object, when you have the relevant permission to read object tags.

         

        You can use `GetObjectTagging <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObjectTagging.html>`__ to retrieve the tag set associated with an object.
