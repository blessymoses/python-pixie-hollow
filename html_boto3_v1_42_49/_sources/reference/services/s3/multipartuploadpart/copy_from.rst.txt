.. py:method:: S3.MultipartUploadPart.copy_from(**kwargs)

  

  Uploads a part by copying data from an existing object as data source. To specify the data source, you add the request header ``x-amz-copy-source`` in your request. To specify a byte range, you add the request header ``x-amz-copy-source-range`` in your request.

   

  For information about maximum and minimum part sizes and other multipart upload specifications, see `Multipart upload limits <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/qfacts.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

   

  .. note::

    

    Instead of copying data from an existing object as part data, you might use the `UploadPart <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html>`__ action to upload new data as a part of an object in your request.

    

   

  You must initiate a multipart upload before you can upload any part. In response to your initiate request, Amazon S3 returns the upload ID, a unique identifier that you must include in your upload part request.

   

  For conceptual information about multipart uploads, see `Uploading Objects Using Multipart Upload <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/uploadobjusingmpu.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*. For information about copying objects using a single atomic action vs. a multipart upload, see `Operations on Objects <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ObjectOperations.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

   

  .. note::

    

    **Directory buckets** - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format ``https://amzn-s3-demo-bucket.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com/key-name ``. Path-style requests are not supported. For more information about endpoints in Availability Zones, see `Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets in Availability Zones <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/endpoint-directory-buckets-AZ.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*. For more information about endpoints in Local Zones, see `Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-lzs-for-directory-buckets.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

    

    Authentication and authorization  

  All ``UploadPartCopy`` requests must be authenticated and signed by using IAM credentials (access key ID and secret access key for the IAM identities). All headers with the ``x-amz-`` prefix, including ``x-amz-copy-source``, must be signed. For more information, see `REST Authentication <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RESTAuthentication.html>`__.

   

  **Directory buckets** - You must use IAM credentials to authenticate and authorize your access to the ``UploadPartCopy`` API operation, instead of using the temporary security credentials through the ``CreateSession`` API operation.

   

  Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs handles authentication and authorization on your behalf.

    Permissions  

  You must have ``READ`` access to the source object and ``WRITE`` access to the destination bucket.

   

  
  * **General purpose bucket permissions** - You must have the permissions in a policy based on the bucket types of your source bucket and destination bucket in an ``UploadPartCopy`` operation. 

    
    * If the source object is in a general purpose bucket, you must have the ``s3:GetObject`` permission to read the source object that is being copied.
     
    * If the destination bucket is a general purpose bucket, you must have the ``s3:PutObject`` permission to write the object copy to the destination bucket.
     
    * To perform a multipart upload with encryption using an Key Management Service key, the requester must have permission to the ``kms:Decrypt`` and ``kms:GenerateDataKey`` actions on the key. The requester must also have permissions for the ``kms:GenerateDataKey`` action for the ``CreateMultipartUpload`` API. Then, the requester needs permissions for the ``kms:Decrypt`` action on the ``UploadPart`` and ``UploadPartCopy`` APIs. These permissions are required because Amazon S3 must decrypt and read data from the encrypted file parts before it completes the multipart upload. For more information about KMS permissions, see `Protecting data using server-side encryption with KMS <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingKMSEncryption.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*. For information about the permissions required to use the multipart upload API, see `Multipart upload and permissions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuAndPermissions.html>`__ and `Multipart upload API and permissions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/mpuoverview.html#mpuAndPermissions>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
    

  
   
  * **Directory bucket permissions** - You must have permissions in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy based on the source and destination bucket types in an ``UploadPartCopy`` operation. 

    
    * If the source object that you want to copy is in a directory bucket, you must have the ``s3express:CreateSession`` permission in the ``Action`` element of a policy to read the object. By default, the session is in the ``ReadWrite`` mode. If you want to restrict the access, you can explicitly set the ``s3express:SessionMode`` condition key to ``ReadOnly`` on the copy source bucket.
     
    * If the copy destination is a directory bucket, you must have the ``s3express:CreateSession`` permission in the ``Action`` element of a policy to write the object to the destination. The ``s3express:SessionMode`` condition key cannot be set to ``ReadOnly`` on the copy destination.
    

   

  If the object is encrypted with SSE-KMS, you must also have the ``kms:GenerateDataKey`` and ``kms:Decrypt`` permissions in IAM identity-based policies and KMS key policies for the KMS key.

   

  For example policies, see `Example bucket policies for S3 Express One Zone <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-security-iam-example-bucket-policies.html>`__ and `Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management (IAM) identity-based policies for S3 Express One Zone <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-security-iam-identity-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

  
  

    Encryption  

  
  * **General purpose buckets** - For information about using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys with the ``UploadPartCopy`` operation, see `CopyObject <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CopyObject.html>`__ and `UploadPart <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html>`__. 

  .. note::

    If you have server-side encryption with customer-provided keys (SSE-C) blocked for your general purpose bucket, you will get an HTTP 403 Access Denied error when you specify the SSE-C request headers while writing new data to your bucket. For more information, see `Blocking or unblocking SSE-C for a general purpose bucket <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/blocking-unblocking-s3-c-encryption-gpb.html>`__.

  
   
  * **Directory buckets** - For directory buckets, there are only two supported options for server-side encryption: server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) ( ``AES256``) and server-side encryption with KMS keys (SSE-KMS) ( ``aws:kms``). For more information, see `Protecting data with server-side encryption <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-serv-side-encryption.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*. 

  .. note::

    For directory buckets, when you perform a ``CreateMultipartUpload`` operation and an ``UploadPartCopy`` operation, the request headers you provide in the ``CreateMultipartUpload`` request must match the default encryption configuration of the destination bucket.

   S3 Bucket Keys aren't supported, when you copy SSE-KMS encrypted objects from general purpose buckets to directory buckets, from directory buckets to general purpose buckets, or between directory buckets, through `UploadPartCopy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html>`__. In this case, Amazon S3 makes a call to KMS every time a copy request is made for a KMS-encrypted object.
  

    Special errors  

  
  * Error Code: ``NoSuchUpload`` 

    
    * Description: The specified multipart upload does not exist. The upload ID might be invalid, or the multipart upload might have been aborted or completed.

  :type CopySource: str or dict
  :param CopySource: **[REQUIRED]** The name of the source bucket, key name of the source object, and optional version ID of the source object.  You can either provide this value as a string or a dictionary.  The string form is {bucket}/{key} or {bucket}/{key}?versionId={versionId} if you want to copy a specific version.  You can also provide this value as a dictionary.  The dictionary format is recommended over the string format because it is more explicit.  The dictionary format is: {'Bucket': 'bucket', 'Key': 'key', 'VersionId': 'id'}.  Note that the VersionId key is optional and may be omitted. To specify an S3 access point, provide the access point ARN for the ``Bucket`` key in the copy source dictionary. If you want to provide the copy source for an S3 access point as a string instead of a dictionary, the ARN provided must be the full S3 access point object ARN (i.e. {accesspoint_arn}/object/{key})
