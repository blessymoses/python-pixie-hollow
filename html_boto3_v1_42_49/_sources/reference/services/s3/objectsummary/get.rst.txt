.. py:method:: S3.ObjectSummary.get(**kwargs)

  

  Retrieves an object from Amazon S3.

   

  In the ``GetObject`` request, specify the full key name for the object.

   

  **General purpose buckets** - Both the virtual-hosted-style requests and the path-style requests are supported. For a virtual hosted-style request example, if you have the object ``photos/2006/February/sample.jpg``, specify the object key name as ``/photos/2006/February/sample.jpg``. For a path-style request example, if you have the object ``photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`` in the bucket named ``examplebucket``, specify the object key name as ``/examplebucket/photos/2006/February/sample.jpg``. For more information about request types, see `HTTP Host Header Bucket Specification <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/VirtualHosting.html#VirtualHostingSpecifyBucket>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

   

  **Directory buckets** - Only virtual-hosted-style requests are supported. For a virtual hosted-style request example, if you have the object ``photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`` in the bucket named ``amzn-s3-demo-bucket--usw2-az1--x-s3``, specify the object key name as ``/photos/2006/February/sample.jpg``. Also, when you make requests to this API operation, your requests are sent to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format ``https://bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com/key-name ``. Path-style requests are not supported. For more information about endpoints in Availability Zones, see `Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets in Availability Zones <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/endpoint-directory-buckets-AZ.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*. For more information about endpoints in Local Zones, see `Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-lzs-for-directory-buckets.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

    Permissions  

  
  * **General purpose bucket permissions** - You must have the required permissions in a policy. To use ``GetObject``, you must have the ``READ`` access to the object (or version). If you grant ``READ`` access to the anonymous user, the ``GetObject`` operation returns the object without using an authorization header. For more information, see `Specifying permissions in a policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-with-s3-actions.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*. If you include a ``versionId`` in your request header, you must have the ``s3:GetObjectVersion`` permission to access a specific version of an object. The ``s3:GetObject`` permission is not required in this scenario. If you request the current version of an object without a specific ``versionId`` in the request header, only the ``s3:GetObject`` permission is required. The ``s3:GetObjectVersion`` permission is not required in this scenario. If the object that you request doesn’t exist, the error that Amazon S3 returns depends on whether you also have the ``s3:ListBucket`` permission. 

    
    * If you have the ``s3:ListBucket`` permission on the bucket, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP status code ``404 Not Found`` error.
     
    * If you don’t have the ``s3:ListBucket`` permission, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP status code ``403 Access Denied`` error.
    

  
   
  * **Directory bucket permissions** - To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the `CreateSession <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html>`__ API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the ``s3express:CreateSession`` permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the ``CreateSession`` API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another ``CreateSession`` API call to generate a new session token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see `CreateSession <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html>`__. If the object is encrypted using SSE-KMS, you must also have the ``kms:GenerateDataKey`` and ``kms:Decrypt`` permissions in IAM identity-based policies and KMS key policies for the KMS key.
  

    Storage classes  

  If the object you are retrieving is stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval storage class, the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class, the S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive Access tier, or the S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive Access tier, before you can retrieve the object you must first restore a copy using `RestoreObject <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_RestoreObject.html>`__. Otherwise, this operation returns an ``InvalidObjectState`` error. For information about restoring archived objects, see `Restoring Archived Objects <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/restoring-objects.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

   

  **Directory buckets** - Directory buckets only support ``EXPRESS_ONEZONE`` (the S3 Express One Zone storage class) in Availability Zones and ``ONEZONE_IA`` (the S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access storage class) in Dedicated Local Zones. Unsupported storage class values won't write a destination object and will respond with the HTTP status code ``400 Bad Request``.

    Encryption  

  Encryption request headers, like ``x-amz-server-side-encryption``, should not be sent for the ``GetObject`` requests, if your object uses server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3), server-side encryption with Key Management Service (KMS) keys (SSE-KMS), or dual-layer server-side encryption with Amazon Web Services KMS keys (DSSE-KMS). If you include the header in your ``GetObject`` requests for the object that uses these types of keys, you’ll get an HTTP ``400 Bad Request`` error.

   

  **Directory buckets** - For directory buckets, there are only two supported options for server-side encryption: SSE-S3 and SSE-KMS. SSE-C isn't supported. For more information, see `Protecting data with server-side encryption <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-serv-side-encryption.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

    Overriding response header values through the request  

  There are times when you want to override certain response header values of a ``GetObject`` response. For example, you might override the ``Content-Disposition`` response header value through your ``GetObject`` request.

   

  You can override values for a set of response headers. These modified response header values are included only in a successful response, that is, when the HTTP status code ``200 OK`` is returned. The headers you can override using the following query parameters in the request are a subset of the headers that Amazon S3 accepts when you create an object.

   

  The response headers that you can override for the ``GetObject`` response are ``Cache-Control``, ``Content-Disposition``, ``Content-Encoding``, ``Content-Language``, ``Content-Type``, and ``Expires``.

   

  To override values for a set of response headers in the ``GetObject`` response, you can use the following query parameters in the request.

   

  
  * ``response-cache-control``
   
  * ``response-content-disposition``
   
  * ``response-content-encoding``
   
  * ``response-content-language``
   
  * ``response-content-type``
   
  * ``response-expires``
  

   

  .. note::

    

    When you use these parameters, you must sign the request by using either an Authorization header or a presigned URL. These parameters cannot be used with an unsigned (anonymous) request.

    

    HTTP Host header syntax  

  **Directory buckets** - The HTTP Host header syntax is ``Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com``.

     

  The following operations are related to ``GetObject``:

   

  
  * `ListBuckets <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListBuckets.html>`__
   
  * `GetObjectAcl <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObjectAcl.html>`__
  

   

  .. warning::

     

    You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is ``my file.txt``, containing two spaces after ``my``, you must URL encode this value to ``my%20%20file.txt``.

  :type VersionId: string
  :param VersionId: 

    Version ID used to reference a specific version of the object.

     

    By default, the ``GetObject`` operation returns the current version of an object. To return a different version, use the ``versionId`` subresource.

     

    .. note::

      

      
      * If you include a ``versionId`` in your request header, you must have the ``s3:GetObjectVersion`` permission to access a specific version of an object. The ``s3:GetObject`` permission is not required in this scenario.
       
      * If you request the current version of an object without a specific ``versionId`` in the request header, only the ``s3:GetObject`` permission is required. The ``s3:GetObjectVersion`` permission is not required in this scenario.
       
      * **Directory buckets** - S3 Versioning isn't enabled and supported for directory buckets. For this API operation, only the ``null`` value of the version ID is supported by directory buckets. You can only specify ``null`` to the ``versionId`` query parameter in the request.
      

      

     

    For more information about versioning, see `PutBucketVersioning <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketVersioning.html>`__.

    

  
  :type SSECustomerAlgorithm: string
  :param SSECustomerAlgorithm: 

    Specifies the algorithm to use when decrypting the object (for example, ``AES256``).

     

    If you encrypt an object by using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) when you store the object in Amazon S3, then when you GET the object, you must use the following headers:

     

    
    * ``x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm``
     
    * ``x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key``
     
    * ``x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5``
    

     

    For more information about SSE-C, see `Server-Side Encryption (Using Customer-Provided Encryption Keys) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ServerSideEncryptionCustomerKeys.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

     

    .. note::

      

      This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

      

    

  
  :type SSECustomerKey: string
  :param SSECustomerKey: 

    Specifies the customer-provided encryption key that you originally provided for Amazon S3 to encrypt the data before storing it. This value is used to decrypt the object when recovering it and must match the one used when storing the data. The key must be appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in the ``x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm`` header.

     

    If you encrypt an object by using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) when you store the object in Amazon S3, then when you GET the object, you must use the following headers:

     

    
    * ``x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm``
     
    * ``x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key``
     
    * ``x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5``
    

     

    For more information about SSE-C, see `Server-Side Encryption (Using Customer-Provided Encryption Keys) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ServerSideEncryptionCustomerKeys.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

      This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

      

    

  
  :type SSECustomerKeyMD5: string
  :param SSECustomerKeyMD5: 

    Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the customer-provided encryption key according to RFC 1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check to ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.

     

    If you encrypt an object by using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) when you store the object in Amazon S3, then when you GET the object, you must use the following headers:

     

    
    * ``x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm``
     
    * ``x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key``
     
    * ``x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5``
    

     

    For more information about SSE-C, see `Server-Side Encryption (Using Customer-Provided Encryption Keys) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ServerSideEncryptionCustomerKeys.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

     

    .. note::

      

      This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

      

        Please note that this parameter is automatically populated if it is not provided. Including this parameter is not required



  
  :type RequestPayer: string
  :param RequestPayer: 

    Confirms that the requester knows that they will be charged for the request. Bucket owners need not specify this parameter in their requests. If either the source or destination S3 bucket has Requester Pays enabled, the requester will pay for the corresponding charges. For information about downloading objects from Requester Pays buckets, see `Downloading Objects in Requester Pays Buckets <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ObjectsinRequesterPaysBuckets.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

     

    .. note::

      

      This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

      

    

  
  :type PartNumber: integer
  :param PartNumber: 

    Part number of the object being read. This is a positive integer between 1 and 10,000. Effectively performs a 'ranged' GET request for the part specified. Useful for downloading just a part of an object.

    

  
  :type ExpectedBucketOwner: string
  :param ExpectedBucketOwner: 

    The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that you provide does not match the actual owner of the bucket, the request fails with the HTTP status code ``403 Forbidden`` (access denied).

    

  
  :type ChecksumMode: string
  :param ChecksumMode: 

    To retrieve the checksum, this mode must be enabled.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **Body** (:class:`.StreamingBody`) -- 

        Object data.

        
      

      - **DeleteMarker** *(boolean) --* 

        Indicates whether the object retrieved was (true) or was not (false) a Delete Marker. If false, this response header does not appear in the response.

         

        .. note::

          

          
          * If the current version of the object is a delete marker, Amazon S3 behaves as if the object was deleted and includes ``x-amz-delete-marker: true`` in the response.
           
          * If the specified version in the request is a delete marker, the response returns a ``405 Method Not Allowed`` error and the ``Last-Modified: timestamp`` response header.
          

          

        
      

      - **AcceptRanges** *(string) --* 

        Indicates that a range of bytes was specified in the request.

        
      

      - **Expiration** *(string) --* 

        If the object expiration is configured (see `PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration.html>`__), the response includes this header. It includes the ``expiry-date`` and ``rule-id`` key-value pairs providing object expiration information. The value of the ``rule-id`` is URL-encoded.

         

        .. note::

          

          Object expiration information is not returned in directory buckets and this header returns the value " ``NotImplemented``" in all responses for directory buckets.

          

        
      

      - **Restore** *(string) --* 

        Provides information about object restoration action and expiration time of the restored object copy.

         

        .. note::

          

          This functionality is not supported for directory buckets. Directory buckets only support ``EXPRESS_ONEZONE`` (the S3 Express One Zone storage class) in Availability Zones and ``ONEZONE_IA`` (the S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access storage class) in Dedicated Local Zones.

          

        
      

      - **LastModified** *(datetime) --* 

        Date and time when the object was last modified.

         

        **General purpose buckets** - When you specify a ``versionId`` of the object in your request, if the specified version in the request is a delete marker, the response returns a ``405 Method Not Allowed`` error and the ``Last-Modified: timestamp`` response header.

        
      

      - **ContentLength** *(integer) --* 

        Size of the body in bytes.

        
      

      - **ETag** *(string) --* 

        An entity tag (ETag) is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL.

        
      

      - **ChecksumCRC32** *(string) --* 

        The Base64 encoded, 32-bit ``CRC32`` checksum of the object. This checksum is only present if the object was uploaded with the object. For more information, see `Checking object integrity <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

        
      

      - **ChecksumCRC32C** *(string) --* 

        The Base64 encoded, 32-bit ``CRC32C`` checksum of the object. This checksum is only present if the checksum was uploaded with the object.
