.. py:method:: S3.Client.list_parts(**kwargs)

  

  Lists the parts that have been uploaded for a specific multipart upload.

   

  To use this operation, you must provide the ``upload ID`` in the request. You obtain this uploadID by sending the initiate multipart upload request through `CreateMultipartUpload <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateMultipartUpload.html>`__.

   

  The ``ListParts`` request returns a maximum of 1,000 uploaded parts. The limit of 1,000 parts is also the default value. You can restrict the number of parts in a response by specifying the ``max-parts`` request parameter. If your multipart upload consists of more than 1,000 parts, the response returns an ``IsTruncated`` field with the value of ``true``, and a ``NextPartNumberMarker`` element. To list remaining uploaded parts, in subsequent ``ListParts`` requests, include the ``part-number-marker`` query string parameter and set its value to the ``NextPartNumberMarker`` field value from the previous response.

   

  For more information on multipart uploads, see `Uploading Objects Using Multipart Upload <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/uploadobjusingmpu.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

   

  .. note::

    

    **Directory buckets** - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format ``https://amzn-s3-demo-bucket.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com/key-name ``. Path-style requests are not supported. For more information about endpoints in Availability Zones, see `Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets in Availability Zones <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/endpoint-directory-buckets-AZ.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*. For more information about endpoints in Local Zones, see `Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-lzs-for-directory-buckets.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

    

    Permissions  

  
  * **General purpose bucket permissions** - For information about permissions required to use the multipart upload API, see `Multipart Upload and Permissions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuAndPermissions.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*. If the upload was created using server-side encryption with Key Management Service (KMS) keys (SSE-KMS) or dual-layer server-side encryption with Amazon Web Services KMS keys (DSSE-KMS), you must have permission to the ``kms:Decrypt`` action for the ``ListParts`` request to succeed.
   
  * **Directory bucket permissions** - To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the `CreateSession <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html>`__ API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the ``s3express:CreateSession`` permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the ``CreateSession`` API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another ``CreateSession`` API call to generate a new session token for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see `CreateSession <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html>`__.
  

    HTTP Host header syntax  

  **Directory buckets** - The HTTP Host header syntax is ``Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com``.

     

  The following operations are related to ``ListParts``:

   

  
  * `CreateMultipartUpload <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateMultipartUpload.html>`__
   
  * `UploadPart <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html>`__
   
  * `CompleteMultipartUpload <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CompleteMultipartUpload.html>`__
   
  * `AbortMultipartUpload <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_AbortMultipartUpload.html>`__
   
  * `GetObjectAttributes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObjectAttributes.html>`__
   
  * `ListMultipartUploads <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListMultipartUploads.html>`__
  

   

  .. warning::

     

    You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is ``my file.txt``, containing two spaces after ``my``, you must URL encode this value to ``my%20%20file.txt``.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_parts(
        Bucket='string',
        Key='string',
        MaxParts=123,
        PartNumberMarker=123,
        UploadId='string',
        RequestPayer='requester',
        ExpectedBucketOwner='string',
        SSECustomerAlgorithm='string',
        SSECustomerKey='string',
        
    )
    
  :type Bucket: string
  :param Bucket: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of the bucket to which the parts are being uploaded.

     

    **Directory buckets** - When you use this operation with a directory bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format ``Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com``. Path-style requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names must follow the format ``bucket-base-name--zone-id--x-s3`` (for example, ``amzn-s3-demo-bucket--usw2-az1--x-s3``). For information about bucket naming restrictions, see `Directory bucket naming rules <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

     

    **Access points** - When you use this action with an access point for general purpose buckets, you must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When you use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form *AccessPointName*-*AccountId*.s3-accesspoint.*Region*.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see `Using access points <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

     

    .. note::

      

      Object Lambda access points are not supported by directory buckets.

      

     

    **S3 on Outposts** - When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form ``AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com``. When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, the destination bucket must be the Outposts access point ARN or the access point alias. For more information about S3 on Outposts, see `What is S3 on Outposts? <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
