.. py:method:: S3.Client.get_bucket_metadata_configuration(**kwargs)

  

  Retrieves the S3 Metadata configuration for a general purpose bucket. For more information, see `Accelerating data discovery with S3 Metadata <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/metadata-tables-overview.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

   

  .. note::

    

    You can use the V2 ``GetBucketMetadataConfiguration`` API operation with V1 or V2 metadata configurations. However, if you try to use the V1 ``GetBucketMetadataTableConfiguration`` API operation with V2 configurations, you will receive an HTTP ``405 Method Not Allowed`` error.

    

    Permissions  

  To use this operation, you must have the ``s3:GetBucketMetadataTableConfiguration`` permission. For more information, see `Setting up permissions for configuring metadata tables <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/metadata-tables-permissions.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

   

  .. note::

    

    The IAM policy action name is the same for the V1 and V2 API operations.

    

     

  The following operations are related to ``GetBucketMetadataConfiguration``:

   

  
  * `CreateBucketMetadataConfiguration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateBucketMetadataConfiguration.html>`__
   
  * `DeleteBucketMetadataConfiguration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_DeleteBucketMetadataConfiguration.html>`__
   
  * `UpdateBucketMetadataInventoryTableConfiguration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UpdateBucketMetadataInventoryTableConfiguration.html>`__
   
  * `UpdateBucketMetadataJournalTableConfiguration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UpdateBucketMetadataJournalTableConfiguration.html>`__
  

   

  .. warning::

     

    You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is ``my file.txt``, containing two spaces after ``my``, you must URL encode this value to ``my%20%20file.txt``.

              - **ErrorCode** *(string) --* 

                If the V1 ``CreateBucketMetadataTableConfiguration`` request succeeds, but S3 Metadata was unable to create the table, this structure contains the error code. The possible error codes and error messages are as follows:

                 

                
                * ``AccessDeniedCreatingResources`` - You don't have sufficient permissions to create the required resources. Make sure that you have ``s3tables:CreateNamespace``, ``s3tables:CreateTable``, ``s3tables:GetTable`` and ``s3tables:PutTablePolicy`` permissions, and then try again.

                * ``TableAlreadyExists`` - The table that you specified already exists in the table bucket's namespace. Specify a different table name. To create a new metadata table, you must delete the metadata configuration for this bucket, and then create a new metadata configuration.
                 
                * ``TableBucketNotFound`` - The table bucket that you specified doesn't exist in this Amazon Web Services Region and account. Create or choose a different table bucket. To create a new metadata table, you must delete the metadata configuration for this bucket, and then create a new metadata configuration.
                

                 

                If the V2 ``CreateBucketMetadataConfiguration`` request succeeds, but S3 Metadata was unable to create the table, this structure contains the error code. The possible error codes and error messages are as follows:

              * ``BACKFILLING`` - The inventory table is in the process of being backfilled. When you enable the inventory table for your metadata configuration, the table goes through a process known as backfilling, during which Amazon S3 scans your general purpose bucket to retrieve the initial metadata for all objects in the bucket. Depending on the number of objects in your bucket, this process can take several hours. When the backfilling process is finished, the status of your inventory table changes from ``BACKFILLING`` to ``ACTIVE``. After backfilling is completed, updates to your objects are reflected in the inventory table within one hour.
               
              * ``ACTIVE`` - The inventory table has been created successfully, and records are being delivered to the table.

                * ``TableBucketNotFound`` - The table bucket that you specified doesn't exist in this Amazon Web Services Region and account. Create or choose a different table bucket. To create a new metadata table, you must delete the metadata configuration for this bucket, and then create a new metadata configuration.
                

                 

                If the V2 ``CreateBucketMetadataConfiguration`` request succeeds, but S3 Metadata was unable to create the table, this structure contains the error code. The possible error codes and error messages are as follows:

                 

                
                * ``AccessDeniedCreatingResources`` - You don't have sufficient permissions to create the required resources. Make sure that you have ``s3tables:CreateTableBucket``, ``s3tables:CreateNamespace``, ``s3tables:CreateTable``, ``s3tables:GetTable``, ``s3tables:PutTablePolicy``, ``kms:DescribeKey``, and ``s3tables:PutTableEncryption`` permissions. Additionally, ensure that the KMS key used to encrypt the table still exists, is active and has a resource policy granting access to the S3 service principals ' ``maintenance.s3tables.amazonaws.com``' and ' ``metadata.s3.amazonaws.com``'. To create a new metadata table, you must delete the metadata configuration for this bucket, and then create a new metadata configuration.
                 
                * ``AccessDeniedWritingToTable`` - Unable to write to the metadata table because of missing resource permissions. To fix the resource policy, Amazon S3 needs to create a new metadata table. To create a new metadata table, you must delete the metadata configuration for this bucket, and then create a new metadata configuration.
                 
                * ``DestinationTableNotFound`` - The destination table doesn't exist. To create a new metadata table, you must delete the metadata configuration for this bucket, and then create a new metadata configuration.
                 
                * ``ServerInternalError`` - An internal error has occurred. To create a new metadata table, you must delete the metadata configuration for this bucket, and then create a new metadata configuration.
                 
                * ``JournalTableAlreadyExists`` - A journal table already exists in the Amazon Web Services managed table bucket's namespace. Delete the journal table, and then try again. To create a new metadata table, you must delete the metadata configuration for this bucket, and then create a new metadata configuration.
                 
                * ``InventoryTableAlreadyExists`` - An inventory table already exists in the Amazon Web Services managed table bucket's namespace. Delete the inventory table, and then try again. To create a new metadata table, you must delete the metadata configuration for this bucket, and then create a new metadata configuration.
                 
                * ``JournalTableNotAvailable`` - The journal table that the inventory table relies on has a ``FAILED`` status. An inventory table requires a journal table with an ``ACTIVE`` status. To create a new journal or inventory table, you must delete the metadata configuration for this bucket, along with any journal or inventory tables, and then create a new metadata configuration.
                 
                * ``NoSuchBucket`` - The specified general purpose bucket does not exist.
