.. py:method:: S3.Client.delete_bucket_cors(**kwargs)

  

  .. note::

    

    This operation is not supported for directory buckets.

    

   

  Deletes the ``cors`` configuration information set for the bucket.

   

  To use this operation, you must have permission to perform the ``s3:PutBucketCORS`` action. The bucket owner has this permission by default and can grant this permission to others.

   

  For information about ``cors``, see `Enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/cors.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

  .. warning::

     

    You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is ``my file.txt``, containing two spaces after ``my``, you must URL encode this value to ``my%20%20file.txt``.
