  .. note::

    

    This operation is not supported for directory buckets.

    

   

  Applies a legal hold configuration to the specified object. For more information, see `Locking Objects <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lock.html>`__.

   

  This functionality is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

   

  .. warning::

     

    You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is ``my file.txt``, containing two spaces after ``my``, you must URL encode this value to ``my%20%20file.txt``.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.put_object_legal_hold(
        Bucket='string',
        Key='string',
        LegalHold={
            'Status': 'ON'|'OFF'
        },
        RequestPayer='requester',
        VersionId='string',
        ContentMD5='string',
        ChecksumAlgorithm='CRC32'|'CRC32C'|'SHA1'|'SHA256'|'CRC64NVME',
        ExpectedBucketOwner='string'
    )
    
  :type Bucket: string
  :param Bucket: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The bucket name containing the object that you want to place a legal hold on.

     

    **Access points** - When you use this action with an access point for general purpose buckets, you must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When you use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form *AccessPointName*-*AccountId*.s3-accesspoint.*Region*.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see `Using access points <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

    

  
  :type Key: string
  :param Key: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The key name for the object that you want to place a legal hold on.

    

  
  :type LegalHold: dict
  :param LegalHold: 

    Container element for the legal hold configuration you want to apply to the specified object.

    

  
    - **Status** *(string) --* 

      Indicates whether the specified object has a legal hold in place.

      

    
  
  :type RequestPayer: string
  :param RequestPayer: 

    Confirms that the requester knows that they will be charged for the request. Bucket owners need not specify this parameter in their requests. If either the source or destination S3 bucket has Requester Pays enabled, the requester will pay for the corresponding charges. For information about downloading objects from Requester Pays buckets, see `Downloading Objects in Requester Pays Buckets <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ObjectsinRequesterPaysBuckets.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

     

    .. note::

      

      This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

      

    

  
  :type VersionId: string
  :param VersionId: 

    The version ID of the object that you want to place a legal hold on.

    

  
  :type ContentMD5: string
  :param ContentMD5: 

    The MD5 hash for the request body.

     

    For requests made using the Amazon Web Services Command Line Interface (CLI) or Amazon Web Services SDKs, this field is calculated automatically.

    

  
  :type ChecksumAlgorithm: string
  :param ChecksumAlgorithm: 

    Indicates the algorithm used to create the checksum for the object when you use the SDK. This header will not provide any additional functionality if you don't use the SDK. When you send this header, there must be a corresponding ``x-amz-checksum`` or ``x-amz-trailer`` header sent. Otherwise, Amazon S3 fails the request with the HTTP status code ``400 Bad Request``. For more information, see `Checking object integrity <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

     

    If you provide an individual checksum, Amazon S3 ignores any provided ``ChecksumAlgorithm`` parameter.

    

  
  :type ExpectedBucketOwner: string
  :param ExpectedBucketOwner: 

    The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that you provide does not match the actual owner of the bucket, the request fails with the HTTP status code ``403 Forbidden`` (access denied).

      - **RequestCharged** *(string) --* 

        If present, indicates that the requester was successfully charged for the request.
