You can nolonger use the `PutBucketTagging <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketTagging.html>`__ and `DeleteBucketTagging <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_DeleteBucketTagging.html>`__ actions to tag your bucket. For more information, see `Enabling ABAC in general purpose buckets <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/buckets-tagging-enable-abac.html>`__.
