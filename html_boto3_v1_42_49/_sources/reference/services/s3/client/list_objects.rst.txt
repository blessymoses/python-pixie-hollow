.. py:method:: S3.Client.list_objects(**kwargs)

  

  .. note::

    

    This operation is not supported for directory buckets.

    

   

  Returns some or all (up to 1,000) of the objects in a bucket. You can use the request parameters as selection criteria to return a subset of the objects in a bucket. A 200 OK response can contain valid or invalid XML. Be sure to design your application to parse the contents of the response and handle it appropriately.

   

  .. warning::

     

    This action has been revised. We recommend that you use the newer version, `ListObjectsV2 <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListObjectsV2.html>`__, when developing applications. For backward compatibility, Amazon S3 continues to support ``ListObjects``.

     

   

  The following operations are related to ``ListObjects``:

   

  
  * `ListObjectsV2 <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListObjectsV2.html>`__
   
  * `GetObject <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObject.html>`__

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_objects(
        Bucket='string',
        Delimiter='string',
        EncodingType='url',
        Marker='string',
        MaxKeys=123,
        Prefix='string',
        RequestPayer='requester',
        ExpectedBucketOwner='string',
        OptionalObjectAttributes=[
            'RestoreStatus',
        ]
    )
    
  :type Bucket: string
  :param Bucket: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of the bucket containing the objects.

     

    **Directory buckets** - When you use this operation with a directory bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format ``Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com``. Path-style requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names must follow the format ``bucket-base-name--zone-id--x-s3`` (for example, ``amzn-s3-demo-bucket--usw2-az1--x-s3``). For information about bucket naming restrictions, see `Directory bucket naming rules <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

     

    **Access points** - When you use this action with an access point for general purpose buckets, you must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When you use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form *AccessPointName*-*AccountId*.s3-accesspoint.*Region*.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see `Using access points <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

     

    .. note::

      

      Object Lambda access points are not supported by directory buckets.

      

     

    **S3 on Outposts** - When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form ``AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com``. When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, the destination bucket must be the Outposts access point ARN or the access point alias. For more information about S3 on Outposts, see `What is S3 on Outposts? <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

    

  
  :type Delimiter: string
  :param Delimiter: 

    A delimiter is a character that you use to group keys.

     

    ``CommonPrefixes`` is filtered out from results if it is not lexicographically greater than the key-marker.

    

  
  :type EncodingType: string
  :param EncodingType: 

    Encoding type used by Amazon S3 to encode the `object keys <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-keys.html>`__ in the response. Responses are encoded only in UTF-8. An object key can contain any Unicode character. However, the XML 1.0 parser can't parse certain characters, such as characters with an ASCII value from 0 to 10. For characters that aren't supported in XML 1.0, you can add this parameter to request that Amazon S3 encode the keys in the response. For more information about characters to avoid in object key names, see `Object key naming guidelines <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-keys.html#object-key-guidelines>`__.

     

    .. note::

      

      When using the URL encoding type, non-ASCII characters that are used in an object's key name will be percent-encoded according to UTF-8 code values. For example, the object ``test_file(3).png`` will appear as ``test_file%283%29.png``.

      

    

  
  :type Marker: string
  :param Marker: 

    Marker is where you want Amazon S3 to start listing from. Amazon S3 starts listing after this specified key. Marker can be any key in the bucket.

    

  
  :type MaxKeys: integer
  :param MaxKeys: 

    Sets the maximum number of keys returned in the response. By default, the action returns up to 1,000 key names. The response might contain fewer keys but will never contain more.

    

  
  :type Prefix: string
  :param Prefix: 

    Limits the response to keys that begin with the specified prefix.

    

  
  :type RequestPayer: string
  :param RequestPayer: 

    Confirms that the requester knows that she or he will be charged for the list objects request. Bucket owners need not specify this parameter in their requests.

    

  
  :type ExpectedBucketOwner: string
  :param ExpectedBucketOwner: 

    The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that you provide does not match the actual owner of the bucket, the request fails with the HTTP status code ``403 Forbidden`` (access denied).

    

  
  :type OptionalObjectAttributes: list
  :param OptionalObjectAttributes: 

    Specifies the optional fields that you want returned in the response. Fields that you do not specify are not returned.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **IsTruncated** *(boolean) --* 

        A flag that indicates whether Amazon S3 returned all of the results that satisfied the search criteria.

        
      

      - **Marker** *(string) --* 

        Indicates where in the bucket listing begins. Marker is included in the response if it was sent with the request.

        
      

      - **NextMarker** *(string) --* 

        When the response is truncated (the ``IsTruncated`` element value in the response is ``true``), you can use the key name in this field as the ``marker`` parameter in the subsequent request to get the next set of objects. Amazon S3 lists objects in alphabetical order.

         

        .. note::

          

          This element is returned only if you have the ``delimiter`` request parameter specified. If the response does not include the ``NextMarker`` element and it is truncated, you can use the value of the last ``Key`` element in the response as the ``marker`` parameter in the subsequent request to get the next set of object keys.

          

        
      

      - **Contents** *(list) --* 

        Metadata about each object returned.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          An object consists of data and its descriptive metadata.

          
          

          - **Key** *(string) --* 

            The name that you assign to an object. You use the object key to retrieve the object.

            
          

          - **LastModified** *(datetime) --* 

            Creation date of the object.

            
          

          - **ETag** *(string) --* 

            The entity tag is a hash of the object. The ETag reflects changes only to the contents of an object, not its metadata. The ETag may or may not be an MD5 digest of the object data. Whether or not it is depends on how the object was created and how it is encrypted as described below:

             

            
            * Objects created by the PUT Object, POST Object, or Copy operation, or through the Amazon Web Services Management Console, and are encrypted by SSE-S3 or plaintext, have ETags that are an MD5 digest of their object data.
             
            * Objects created by the PUT Object, POST Object, or Copy operation, or through the Amazon Web Services Management Console, and are encrypted by SSE-C or SSE-KMS, have ETags that are not an MD5 digest of their object data.
             
            * If an object is created by either the Multipart Upload or Part Copy operation, the ETag is not an MD5 digest, regardless of the method of encryption. If an object is larger than 16 MB, the Amazon Web Services Management Console will upload or copy that object as a Multipart Upload, and therefore the ETag will not be an MD5 digest.
            

             

            .. note::

              

              **Directory buckets** - MD5 is not supported by directory buckets.

              

            
          

          - **ChecksumAlgorithm** *(list) --* 

            The algorithm that was used to create a checksum of the object.

            
            

            - *(string) --* 
        
          

          - **ChecksumType** *(string) --* 

            The checksum type that is used to calculate the object’s checksum value. For more information, see `Checking object integrity <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

            
          

          - **Size** *(integer) --* 

            Size in bytes of the object

            
          

          - **StorageClass** *(string) --* 

            The class of storage used to store the object.

             

            .. note::

              

              **Directory buckets** - Directory buckets only support ``EXPRESS_ONEZONE`` (the S3 Express One Zone storage class) in Availability Zones and ``ONEZONE_IA`` (the S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access storage class) in Dedicated Local Zones.

              

            
          

          - **Owner** *(dict) --* 

            The owner of the object

             

            .. note::

              

              **Directory buckets** - The bucket owner is returned as the object owner.

              

            
            

            - **DisplayName** *(string) --* 
            

            - **ID** *(string) --* 

              Container for the ID of the owner.

              
        
          

          - **RestoreStatus** *(dict) --* 

            Specifies the restoration status of an object. Objects in certain storage classes must be restored before they can be retrieved. For more information about these storage classes and how to work with archived objects, see `Working with archived objects <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/archived-objects.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

             

            .. note::

              

              This functionality is not supported for directory buckets. Directory buckets only support ``EXPRESS_ONEZONE`` (the S3 Express One Zone storage class) in Availability Zones and ``ONEZONE_IA`` (the S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access storage class) in Dedicated Local Zones.

              

            
            

            - **IsRestoreInProgress** *(boolean) --* 

              Specifies whether the object is currently being restored. If the object restoration is in progress, the header returns the value ``TRUE``. For example:

               

              ``x-amz-optional-object-attributes: IsRestoreInProgress="true"``

               

              If the object restoration has completed, the header returns the value ``FALSE``. For example:

               

              ``x-amz-optional-object-attributes: IsRestoreInProgress="false", RestoreExpiryDate="2012-12-21T00:00:00.000Z"``

               

              If the object hasn't been restored, there is no header response.

              
            

            - **RestoreExpiryDate** *(datetime) --* 

              Indicates when the restored copy will expire. This value is populated only if the object has already been restored. For example:

               

              ``x-amz-optional-object-attributes: IsRestoreInProgress="false", RestoreExpiryDate="2012-12-21T00:00:00.000Z"``

              
        
      
    
      

      - **Name** *(string) --* 

        The bucket name.

        
      

      - **Prefix** *(string) --* 

        Keys that begin with the indicated prefix.

        
      

      - **Delimiter** *(string) --* 

        Causes keys that contain the same string between the prefix and the first occurrence of the delimiter to be rolled up into a single result element in the ``CommonPrefixes`` collection. These rolled-up keys are not returned elsewhere in the response. Each rolled-up result counts as only one return against the ``MaxKeys`` value.

        
      

      - **MaxKeys** *(integer) --* 

        The maximum number of keys returned in the response body.

        
      

      - **CommonPrefixes** *(list) --* 

        All of the keys (up to 1,000) rolled up in a common prefix count as a single return when calculating the number of returns.

         

        A response can contain ``CommonPrefixes`` only if you specify a delimiter.

         

        ``CommonPrefixes`` contains all (if there are any) keys between ``Prefix`` and the next occurrence of the string specified by the delimiter.

         

        ``CommonPrefixes`` lists keys that act like subdirectories in the directory specified by ``Prefix``.

         

        For example, if the prefix is ``notes/`` and the delimiter is a slash ( ``/``), as in ``notes/summer/july``, the common prefix is ``notes/summer/``. All of the keys that roll up into a common prefix count as a single return when calculating the number of returns.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          Container for all (if there are any) keys between Prefix and the next occurrence of the string specified by a delimiter. CommonPrefixes lists keys that act like subdirectories in the directory specified by Prefix. For example, if the prefix is notes/ and the delimiter is a slash (/) as in notes/summer/july, the common prefix is notes/summer/.

          
          

          - **Prefix** *(string) --* 

            Container for the specified common prefix.

            
      
    
      

      - **EncodingType** *(string) --* 

        Encoding type used by Amazon S3 to encode the `object keys <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-keys.html>`__ in the response. Responses are encoded only in UTF-8. An object key can contain any Unicode character. However, the XML 1.0 parser can't parse certain characters, such as characters with an ASCII value from 0 to 10. For characters that aren't supported in XML 1.0, you can add this parameter to request that Amazon S3 encode the keys in the response. For more information about characters to avoid in object key names, see `Object key naming guidelines <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-keys.html#object-key-guidelines>`__.

         

        .. note::

          

          When using the URL encoding type, non-ASCII characters that are used in an object's key name will be percent-encoded according to UTF-8 code values. For example, the object ``test_file(3).png`` will appear as ``test_file%283%29.png``.

          

        
      

      - **RequestCharged** *(string) --* 

        If present, indicates that the requester was successfully charged for the request. For more information, see `Using Requester Pays buckets for storage transfers and usage <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/RequesterPaysBuckets.html>`__ in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service user guide*.

         

        .. note::

          

          This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.
