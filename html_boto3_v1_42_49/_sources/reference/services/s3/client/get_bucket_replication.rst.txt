.. py:method:: S3.Client.get_bucket_replication(**kwargs)

  

  .. note::

    

    This operation is not supported for directory buckets.

    

   

  Returns the replication configuration of a bucket.

   

  .. note::

    

    It can take a while to propagate the put or delete a replication configuration to all Amazon S3 systems. Therefore, a get request soon after put or delete can return a wrong result.

    

   

  For information about replication configuration, see `Replication <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

   

  This action requires permissions for the ``s3:GetReplicationConfiguration`` action. For more information about permissions, see `Using Bucket Policies and User Policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-iam-policies.html>`__.

   

  If you include the ``Filter`` element in a replication configuration, you must also include the ``DeleteMarkerReplication`` and ``Priority`` elements. The response also returns those elements.

   

  For information about ``GetBucketReplication`` errors, see `List of replication-related error codes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/ErrorResponses.html#ReplicationErrorCodeList>`__

   

  The following operations are related to ``GetBucketReplication``:

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **ReplicationConfiguration** *(dict) --* 

        A container for replication rules. You can add up to 1,000 rules. The maximum size of a replication configuration is 2 MB.

        
        

        - **Role** *(string) --* 

          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that Amazon S3 assumes when replicating objects. For more information, see `How to Set Up Replication <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication-how-setup.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

          
        

        - **Rules** *(list) --* 

          A container for one or more replication rules. A replication configuration must have at least one rule and can contain a maximum of 1,000 rules.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            Specifies which Amazon S3 objects to replicate and where to store the replicas.

            
            

            - **ID** *(string) --* 

              A unique identifier for the rule. The maximum value is 255 characters.

              
            

            - **Priority** *(integer) --* 

              The priority indicates which rule has precedence whenever two or more replication rules conflict. Amazon S3 will attempt to replicate objects according to all replication rules. However, if there are two or more rules with the same destination bucket, then objects will be replicated according to the rule with the highest priority. The higher the number, the higher the priority.

               

              For more information, see `Replication <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

              
            

            - **Prefix** *(string) --* 

              An object key name prefix that identifies the object or objects to which the rule applies. The maximum prefix length is 1,024 characters. To include all objects in a bucket, specify an empty string.

               

              .. warning::

                 

                Replacement must be made for object keys containing special characters (such as carriage returns) when using XML requests. For more information, see `XML related object key constraints <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-keys.html#object-key-xml-related-constraints>`__.

                

              
            

            - **Filter** *(dict) --* 

              A filter that identifies the subset of objects to which the replication rule applies. A ``Filter`` must specify exactly one ``Prefix``, ``Tag``, or an ``And`` child element.

              
              

              - **Prefix** *(string) --* 

                An object key name prefix that identifies the subset of objects to which the rule applies.

              - **And** *(dict) --* 

                A container for specifying rule filters. The filters determine the subset of objects to which the rule applies. This element is required only if you specify more than one filter. For example:

                 

                
                * If you specify both a ``Prefix`` and a ``Tag`` filter, wrap these filters in an ``And`` tag.
                 
                * If you specify a filter based on multiple tags, wrap the ``Tag`` elements in an ``And`` tag.
                

                
                

                - **Prefix** *(string) --* 

                  An object key name prefix that identifies the subset of objects to which the rule applies.

            - **SourceSelectionCriteria** *(dict) --* 

              A container that describes additional filters for identifying the source objects that you want to replicate. You can choose to enable or disable the replication of these objects. Currently, Amazon S3 supports only the filter that you can specify for objects created with server-side encryption using a customer managed key stored in Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (SSE-KMS).

              
              

              - **SseKmsEncryptedObjects** *(dict) --* 

                A container for filter information for the selection of Amazon S3 objects encrypted with Amazon Web Services KMS. If you include ``SourceSelectionCriteria`` in the replication configuration, this element is required.

                
                

                - **Status** *(string) --* 

                  Specifies whether Amazon S3 replicates objects created with server-side encryption using an Amazon Web Services KMS key stored in Amazon Web Services Key Management Service.

                  
            
              

              - **ReplicaModifications** *(dict) --* 

                A filter that you can specify for selections for modifications on replicas. Amazon S3 doesn't replicate replica modifications by default. In the latest version of replication configuration (when ``Filter`` is specified), you can specify this element and set the status to ``Enabled`` to replicate modifications on replicas.

                 

                .. note::

                  

                  If you don't specify the ``Filter`` element, Amazon S3 assumes that the replication configuration is the earlier version, V1. In the earlier version, this element is not allowed

                  

                
                

                - **Status** *(string) --*

                This parameter is no longer supported. To replicate existing objects, see `Replicating existing objects with S3 Batch Replication <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-batch-replication-batch.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

                

              
              

              - **Status** *(string) --* 

                Specifies whether Amazon S3 replicates existing source bucket objects.

                
          
            

            - **Destination** *(dict) --* 

              A container for information about the replication destination and its configurations including enabling the S3 Replication Time Control (S3 RTC).

              
              

              - **Bucket** *(string) --*

              - **Account** *(string) --* 

                Destination bucket owner account ID. In a cross-account scenario, if you direct Amazon S3 to change replica ownership to the Amazon Web Services account that owns the destination bucket by specifying the ``AccessControlTranslation`` property, this is the account ID of the destination bucket owner. For more information, see `Replication Additional Configuration\: Changing the Replica Owner <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication-change-owner.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

                
              

              - **StorageClass** *(string) --* 

                The storage class to use when replicating objects, such as S3 Standard or reduced redundancy. By default, Amazon S3 uses the storage class of the source object to create the object replica.

                 

                For valid values, see the ``StorageClass`` element of the `PUT Bucket replication <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTBucketPUTreplication.html>`__ action in the *Amazon S3 API Reference*.

                 

                ``FSX_OPENZFS`` is not an accepted value when replicating objects.

                
              

              - **AccessControlTranslation** *(dict) --* 

                Specify this only in a cross-account scenario (where source and destination bucket owners are not the same), and you want to change replica ownership to the Amazon Web Services account that owns the destination bucket. If this is not specified in the replication configuration, the replicas are owned by same Amazon Web Services account that owns the source object.

                
                

                - **Owner** *(string) --* 

                  Specifies the replica ownership. For default and valid values, see `PUT bucket replication <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTBucketPUTreplication.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 API Reference*.

                  
            
              

              - **EncryptionConfiguration** *(dict) --* 

                A container that provides information about encryption. If ``SourceSelectionCriteria`` is specified, you must specify this element.

                
                

                - **ReplicaKmsKeyID** *(string) --* 

                  Specifies the ID (Key ARN or Alias ARN) of the customer managed Amazon Web Services KMS key stored in Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (KMS) for the destination bucket. Amazon S3 uses this key to encrypt replica objects. Amazon S3 only supports symmetric encryption KMS keys. For more information, see `Asymmetric keys in Amazon Web Services KMS <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

                  
            
              

              - **ReplicationTime** *(dict) --* 

                A container specifying S3 Replication Time Control (S3 RTC), including whether S3 RTC is enabled and the time when all objects and operations on objects must be replicated. Must be specified together with a ``Metrics`` block.

                
                

                - **Status** *(string) --* 

                  Specifies whether the replication time is enabled.

                  
                

                - **Time** *(dict) --* 

                  A container specifying the time by which replication should be complete for all objects and operations on objects.

                  
                  

                  - **Minutes** *(integer) --* 

                    Contains an integer specifying time in minutes.

                     

                    Valid value: 15

                    
              
            
              

              - **Metrics** *(dict) --* 

                A container specifying replication metrics-related settings enabling replication metrics and events.

                
                

                - **Status** *(string) --* 

                  Specifies whether the replication metrics are enabled.

                  
                

                - **EventThreshold** *(dict) --* 

                  A container specifying the time threshold for emitting the ``s3:Replication:OperationMissedThreshold`` event.

                  
                  

                  - **Minutes** *(integer) --* 

                    Contains an integer specifying time in minutes.

                     

                    Valid value: 15

                    
              
            
          
            

            - **DeleteMarkerReplication** *(dict) --* 

              Specifies whether Amazon S3 replicates delete markers. If you specify a ``Filter`` in your replication configuration, you must also include a ``DeleteMarkerReplication`` element. If your ``Filter`` includes a ``Tag`` element, the ``DeleteMarkerReplication`` ``Status`` must be set to Disabled, because Amazon S3 does not support replicating delete markers for tag-based rules. For an example configuration, see `Basic Rule Configuration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication-add-config.html#replication-config-min-rule-config>`__.

               

              For more information about delete marker replication, see `Basic Rule Configuration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/delete-marker-replication.html>`__.

               

              .. note::

                

                If you are using an earlier version of the replication configuration, Amazon S3 handles replication of delete markers differently. For more information, see `Backward Compatibility <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication-add-config.html#replication-backward-compat-considerations>`__.

                

              
              

              - **Status** *(string) --* 

                Indicates whether to replicate delete markers.

                 

                .. note::

                  

                  Indicates whether to replicate delete markers.

                  

                
          
        
      
    
  

  **Examples**

  The following example returns replication configuration set on a bucket.
  ::

    response = client.get_bucket_replication(
        Bucket='examplebucket',
    )
    
    print(response)

  
  Expected Output:
  ::

    {
        'ReplicationConfiguration': {
            'Role': 'arn:aws:iam::acct-id:role/example-role',
            'Rules': [
                {
                    'Destination': {
                        'Bucket': 'arn:aws:s3:::destination-bucket',
                    },
                    'ID': 'MWIwNTkwZmItMTE3MS00ZTc3LWJkZDEtNzRmODQwYzc1OTQy',
                    'Prefix': 'Tax',
                    'Status': 'Enabled',
