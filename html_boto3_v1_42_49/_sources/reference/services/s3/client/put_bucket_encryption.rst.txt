.. py:method:: S3.Client.put_bucket_encryption(**kwargs)

  

  This operation configures default encryption and Amazon S3 Bucket Keys for an existing bucket. You can also `block encryption types <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_BlockedEncryptionTypes.html>`__ using this operation.

   

  .. note::

    

    **Directory buckets** - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Regional endpoint. These endpoints support path-style requests in the format ``https://s3express-control.region-code.amazonaws.com/bucket-name ``. Virtual-hosted-style requests aren't supported. For more information about endpoints in Availability Zones, see `Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets in Availability Zones <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/endpoint-directory-buckets-AZ.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*. For more information about endpoints in Local Zones, see `Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-lzs-for-directory-buckets.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

    

   

  By default, all buckets have a default encryption configuration that uses server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3).

   

  .. note::

    

    
    * **General purpose buckets** 

      
      * You can optionally configure default encryption for a bucket by using server-side encryption with Key Management Service (KMS) keys (SSE-KMS) or dual-layer server-side encryption with Amazon Web Services KMS keys (DSSE-KMS). If you specify default encryption by using SSE-KMS, you can also configure `Amazon S3 Bucket Keys <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/bucket-key.html>`__. For information about the bucket default encryption feature, see `Amazon S3 Bucket Default Encryption <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/bucket-encryption.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
       
      * If you use PutBucketEncryption to set your `default bucket encryption <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/bucket-encryption.html>`__ to SSE-KMS, you should verify that your KMS key ID is correct. Amazon S3 doesn't validate the KMS key ID provided in PutBucketEncryption requests.
      

    
     
    * **Directory buckets** - You can optionally configure default encryption for a bucket by using server-side encryption with Key Management Service (KMS) keys (SSE-KMS). 

      
      * We recommend that the bucket's default encryption uses the desired encryption configuration and you don't override the bucket default encryption in your ``CreateSession`` requests or ``PUT`` object requests. Then, new objects are automatically encrypted with the desired encryption settings. For more information about the encryption overriding behaviors in directory buckets, see `Specifying server-side encryption with KMS for new object uploads <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-specifying-kms-encryption.html>`__.
       
      * Your SSE-KMS configuration can only support 1 `customer managed key <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#customer-cmk>`__ per directory bucket's lifetime. The `Amazon Web Services managed key <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#aws-managed-cmk>`__ ( ``aws/s3``) isn't supported.
       
      * S3 Bucket Keys are always enabled for ``GET`` and ``PUT`` operations in a directory bucket and can’t be disabled. S3 Bucket Keys aren't supported, when you copy SSE-KMS encrypted objects from general purpose buckets to directory buckets, from directory buckets to general purpose buckets, or between directory buckets, through `CopyObject <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CopyObject.html>`__, `UploadPartCopy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html>`__, `the Copy operation in Batch Operations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-buckets-objects-Batch-Ops>`__, or `the import jobs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/create-import-job>`__. In this case, Amazon S3 makes a call to KMS every time a copy request is made for a KMS-encrypted object.
       
      * When you specify an `KMS customer managed key <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#customer-cmk>`__ for encryption in your directory bucket, only use the key ID or key ARN. The key alias format of the KMS key isn't supported.
       
      * For directory buckets, if you use PutBucketEncryption to set your `default bucket encryption <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/bucket-encryption.html>`__ to SSE-KMS, Amazon S3 validates the KMS key ID provided in PutBucketEncryption requests.
      

    
    

    

   

  .. warning::

     

    If you're specifying a customer managed KMS key, we recommend using a fully qualified KMS key ARN. If you use a KMS key alias instead, then KMS resolves the key within the requester’s account. This behavior can result in data that's encrypted with a KMS key that belongs to the requester, and not the bucket owner.

     

    Also, this action requires Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4. For more information, see `Authenticating Requests (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html>`__.

     

    Permissions  

  
  * **General purpose bucket permissions** - The ``s3:PutEncryptionConfiguration`` permission is required in a policy. The bucket owner has this permission by default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see `Permissions Related to Bucket Operations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources>`__ and `Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
   
  * **Directory bucket permissions** - To grant access to this API operation, you must have the ``s3express:PutEncryptionConfiguration`` permission in an IAM identity-based policy instead of a bucket policy. Cross-account access to this API operation isn't supported. This operation can only be performed by the Amazon Web Services account that owns the resource. For more information about directory bucket policies and permissions, see `Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management (IAM) for S3 Express One Zone <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-security-iam.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*. To set a directory bucket default encryption with SSE-KMS, you must also have the ``kms:GenerateDataKey`` and the ``kms:Decrypt`` permissions in IAM identity-based policies and KMS key policies for the target KMS key.
  

    HTTP Host header syntax  

  **Directory buckets** - The HTTP Host header syntax is ``s3express-control.region-code.amazonaws.com``.

     

  The following operations are related to ``PutBucketEncryption``:

   

  
  * `GetBucketEncryption <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetBucketEncryption.html>`__
   
  * `DeleteBucketEncryption <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_DeleteBucketEncryption.html>`__
  

   

  .. warning::

     

    You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is ``my file.txt``, containing two spaces after ``my``, you must URL encode this value to ``my%20%20file.txt``.

  :type Bucket: string
  :param Bucket: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies default encryption for a bucket using server-side encryption with different key options.

     

    **Directory buckets** - When you use this operation with a directory bucket, you must use path-style requests in the format ``https://s3express-control.region-code.amazonaws.com/bucket-name ``. Virtual-hosted-style requests aren't supported. Directory bucket names must be unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names must also follow the format ``bucket-base-name--zone-id--x-s3`` (for example, ``DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET--usw2-az1--x-s3``). For information about bucket naming restrictions, see `Directory bucket naming rules <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*

    

  
  :type ContentMD5: string
  :param ContentMD5: 

    The Base64 encoded 128-bit ``MD5`` digest of the server-side encryption configuration.

     

    For requests made using the Amazon Web Services Command Line Interface (CLI) or Amazon Web Services SDKs, this field is calculated automatically.

     

    .. note::

      

      This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

      

    

  
  :type ChecksumAlgorithm: string
  :param ChecksumAlgorithm: 

    Indicates the algorithm used to create the checksum for the request when you use the SDK. This header will not provide any additional functionality if you don't use the SDK. When you send this header, there must be a corresponding ``x-amz-checksum`` or ``x-amz-trailer`` header sent. Otherwise, Amazon S3 fails the request with the HTTP status code ``400 Bad Request``. For more information, see `Checking object integrity <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

     

    If you provide an individual checksum, Amazon S3 ignores any provided ``ChecksumAlgorithm`` parameter.

     

    .. note::

      

      For directory buckets, when you use Amazon Web Services SDKs, ``CRC32`` is the default checksum algorithm that's used for performance.

      

    

  
  :type ServerSideEncryptionConfiguration: dict
  :param ServerSideEncryptionConfiguration: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies the default server-side-encryption configuration.

    

  
    - **Rules** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      Container for information about a particular server-side encryption configuration rule.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        Specifies the default server-side encryption configuration.

         

        .. note::

          

          
          * **General purpose buckets** - If you're specifying a customer managed KMS key, we recommend using a fully qualified KMS key ARN. If you use a KMS key alias instead, then KMS resolves the key within the requester’s account. This behavior can result in data that's encrypted with a KMS key that belongs to the requester, and not the bucket owner.
           
          * **Directory buckets** - When you specify an `KMS customer managed key <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#customer-cmk>`__ for encryption in your directory bucket, only use the key ID or key ARN. The key alias format of the KMS key isn't supported.
          

          

        

      
        - **ApplyServerSideEncryptionByDefault** *(dict) --* 

          Specifies the default server-side encryption to apply to new objects in the bucket. If a PUT Object request doesn't specify any server-side encryption, this default encryption will be applied.

          

        
          - **SSEAlgorithm** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            Server-side encryption algorithm to use for the default encryption.

             

            .. note::

              

              For directory buckets, there are only two supported values for server-side encryption: ``AES256`` and ``aws:kms``.

              

            

          
          - **KMSMasterKeyID** *(string) --* 

            Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (KMS) customer managed key ID to use for the default encryption.

             

            .. note::

              

              
              * **General purpose buckets** - This parameter is allowed if and only if ``SSEAlgorithm`` is set to ``aws:kms`` or ``aws:kms:dsse``.
               
              * **Directory buckets** - This parameter is allowed if and only if ``SSEAlgorithm`` is set to ``aws:kms``.
              

              

             

            You can specify the key ID, key alias, or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the KMS key.

             

            
            * Key ID: ``1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab``
             
            * Key ARN: ``arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab``
             
            * Key Alias: ``alias/alias-name``
            

             

            If you are using encryption with cross-account or Amazon Web Services service operations, you must use a fully qualified KMS key ARN. For more information, see `Using encryption for cross-account operations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/bucket-encryption.html#bucket-encryption-update-bucket-policy>`__.

        - **BucketKeyEnabled** *(boolean) --* 

          Specifies whether Amazon S3 should use an S3 Bucket Key with server-side encryption using KMS (SSE-KMS) for new objects in the bucket. Existing objects are not affected. Setting the ``BucketKeyEnabled`` element to ``true`` causes Amazon S3 to use an S3 Bucket Key.

        - **BlockedEncryptionTypes** *(dict) --* 

          A bucket-level setting for Amazon S3 general purpose buckets used to prevent the upload of new objects encrypted with the specified server-side encryption type. For example, blocking an encryption type will block ``PutObject``, ``CopyObject``, ``PostObject``, multipart upload, and replication requests to the bucket for objects with the specified encryption type. However, you can continue to read and list any pre-existing objects already encrypted with the specified encryption type.
