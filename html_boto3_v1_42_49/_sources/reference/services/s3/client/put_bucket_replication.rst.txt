.. py:method:: S3.Client.put_bucket_replication(**kwargs)

  

  .. note::

    

    This operation is not supported for directory buckets.

    

   

  Creates a replication configuration or replaces an existing one. For more information, see `Replication <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

   

  Specify the replication configuration in the request body. In the replication configuration, you provide the name of the destination bucket or buckets where you want Amazon S3 to replicate objects, the IAM role that Amazon S3 can assume to replicate objects on your behalf, and other relevant information. You can invoke this request for a specific Amazon Web Services Region by using the `aws\:RequestedRegion <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html#condition-keys-requestedregion>`__ condition key.

   

  A replication configuration must include at least one rule, and can contain a maximum of 1,000. Each rule identifies a subset of objects to replicate by filtering the objects in the source bucket. To choose additional subsets of objects to replicate, add a rule for each subset.

   

  To specify a subset of the objects in the source bucket to apply a replication rule to, add the Filter element as a child of the Rule element. You can filter objects based on an object key prefix, one or more object tags, or both. When you add the Filter element in the configuration, you must also add the following elements: ``DeleteMarkerReplication``, ``Status``, and ``Priority``.

   

  .. note::

    

    If you are using an earlier version of the replication configuration, Amazon S3 handles replication of delete markers differently. For more information, see `Backward Compatibility <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication-add-config.html#replication-backward-compat-considerations>`__.

    

   

  For information about enabling versioning on a bucket, see `Using Versioning <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Versioning.html>`__.

    Handling Replication of Encrypted Objects  

  By default, Amazon S3 doesn't replicate objects that are stored at rest using server-side encryption with KMS keys. To replicate Amazon Web Services KMS-encrypted objects, add the following: ``SourceSelectionCriteria``, ``SseKmsEncryptedObjects``, ``Status``, ``EncryptionConfiguration``, and ``ReplicaKmsKeyID``. For information about replication configuration, see `Replicating Objects Created with SSE Using KMS keys <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication-config-for-kms-objects.html>`__.

   

  For information on ``PutBucketReplication`` errors, see `List of replication-related error codes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/ErrorResponses.html#ReplicationErrorCodeList>`__

    Permissions  

  To create a ``PutBucketReplication`` request, you must have ``s3:PutReplicationConfiguration`` permissions for the bucket.

   

  By default, a resource owner, in this case the Amazon Web Services account that created the bucket, can perform this operation. The resource owner can also grant others permissions to perform the operation. For more information about permissions, see `Specifying Permissions in a Policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-with-s3-actions.html>`__ and `Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html>`__.

   

  .. note::

    

    To perform this operation, the user or role performing the action must have the `iam\:PassRole <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_passrole.html>`__ permission.

    

     

  The following operations are related to ``PutBucketReplication``:

   

  
  * `GetBucketReplication <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetBucketReplication.html>`__
   
  * `DeleteBucketReplication <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_DeleteBucketReplication.html>`__
  

   

  .. warning::

     

    You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is ``my file.txt``, containing two spaces after ``my``, you must URL encode this value to ``my%20%20file.txt``.

  :type Bucket: string
  :param Bucket: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of the bucket

    

  
  :type ChecksumAlgorithm: string
  :param ChecksumAlgorithm: 

    Indicates the algorithm used to create the checksum for the request when you use the SDK. This header will not provide any additional functionality if you don't use the SDK. When you send this header, there must be a corresponding ``x-amz-checksum`` or ``x-amz-trailer`` header sent. Otherwise, Amazon S3 fails the request with the HTTP status code ``400 Bad Request``. For more information, see `Checking object integrity <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

     

    If you provide an individual checksum, Amazon S3 ignores any provided ``ChecksumAlgorithm`` parameter.

    

  
  :type ReplicationConfiguration: dict
  :param ReplicationConfiguration: **[REQUIRED]**

    - **Role** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that Amazon S3 assumes when replicating objects. For more information, see `How to Set Up Replication <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication-how-setup.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

      

    
    - **Rules** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      A container for one or more replication rules. A replication configuration must have at least one rule and can contain a maximum of 1,000 rules.

      

    
      - *(dict) --*

        - **Priority** *(integer) --* 

          The priority indicates which rule has precedence whenever two or more replication rules conflict. Amazon S3 will attempt to replicate objects according to all replication rules. However, if there are two or more rules with the same destination bucket, then objects will be replicated according to the rule with the highest priority. The higher the number, the higher the priority.

           

          For more information, see `Replication <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

          

        
        - **Prefix** *(string) --* 

          An object key name prefix that identifies the object or objects to which the rule applies. The maximum prefix length is 1,024 characters. To include all objects in a bucket, specify an empty string.

           

          .. warning::

             

            Replacement must be made for object keys containing special characters (such as carriage returns) when using XML requests. For more information, see `XML related object key constraints <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-keys.html#object-key-xml-related-constraints>`__.

              Value of the tag.

              

            
          
          - **And** *(dict) --* 

            A container for specifying rule filters. The filters determine the subset of objects to which the rule applies. This element is required only if you specify more than one filter. For example:

             

            
            * If you specify both a ``Prefix`` and a ``Tag`` filter, wrap these filters in an ``And`` tag.
             
            * If you specify a filter based on multiple tags, wrap the ``Tag`` elements in an ``And`` tag.

          - **SseKmsEncryptedObjects** *(dict) --* 

            A container for filter information for the selection of Amazon S3 objects encrypted with Amazon Web Services KMS. If you include ``SourceSelectionCriteria`` in the replication configuration, this element is required.

            

          
            - **Status** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

              Specifies whether Amazon S3 replicates objects created with server-side encryption using an Amazon Web Services KMS key stored in Amazon Web Services Key Management Service.

              

            
          
          - **ReplicaModifications** *(dict) --* 

            A filter that you can specify for selections for modifications on replicas. Amazon S3 doesn't replicate replica modifications by default. In the latest version of replication configuration (when ``Filter`` is specified), you can specify this element and set the status to ``Enabled`` to replicate modifications on replicas.

             

            .. note::

              

              If you don't specify the ``Filter`` element, Amazon S3 assumes that the replication configuration is the earlier version, V1. In the earlier version, this element is not allowed

              

            

          
            - **Status** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the bucket where you want Amazon S3 to store the results.

            

          
          - **Account** *(string) --* 

            Destination bucket owner account ID. In a cross-account scenario, if you direct Amazon S3 to change replica ownership to the Amazon Web Services account that owns the destination bucket by specifying the ``AccessControlTranslation`` property, this is the account ID of the destination bucket owner. For more information, see `Replication Additional Configuration\: Changing the Replica Owner <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication-change-owner.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

            

          
          - **StorageClass** *(string) --* 

            The storage class to use when replicating objects, such as S3 Standard or reduced redundancy. By default, Amazon S3 uses the storage class of the source object to create the object replica.

             

            For valid values, see the ``StorageClass`` element of the `PUT Bucket replication <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTBucketPUTreplication.html>`__ action in the *Amazon S3 API Reference*.

             

            ``FSX_OPENZFS`` is not an accepted value when replicating objects.

            

          
          - **AccessControlTranslation** *(dict) --* 

            Specify this only in a cross-account scenario (where source and destination bucket owners are not the same), and you want to change replica ownership to the Amazon Web Services account that owns the destination bucket. If this is not specified in the replication configuration, the replicas are owned by same Amazon Web Services account that owns the source object.

            

          
            - **Owner** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

              Specifies the replica ownership. For default and valid values, see `PUT bucket replication <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTBucketPUTreplication.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 API Reference*.

              

            
          
          - **EncryptionConfiguration** *(dict) --*

            - **ReplicaKmsKeyID** *(string) --* 

              Specifies the ID (Key ARN or Alias ARN) of the customer managed Amazon Web Services KMS key stored in Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (KMS) for the destination bucket. Amazon S3 uses this key to encrypt replica objects. Amazon S3 only supports symmetric encryption KMS keys. For more information, see `Asymmetric keys in Amazon Web Services KMS <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

              

            
          
          - **ReplicationTime** *(dict) --* 

            A container specifying S3 Replication Time Control (S3 RTC), including whether S3 RTC is enabled and the time when all objects and operations on objects must be replicated. Must be specified together with a ``Metrics`` block.

            

          
            - **Status** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

              Specifies whether the replication time is enabled.

              

            
            - **Time** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

              A container specifying the time by which replication should be complete for all objects and operations on objects.

          - **Metrics** *(dict) --* 

            A container specifying replication metrics-related settings enabling replication metrics and events.

            

          
            - **Status** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

              Specifies whether the replication metrics are enabled.

              

            
            - **EventThreshold** *(dict) --* 

              A container specifying the time threshold for emitting the ``s3:Replication:OperationMissedThreshold`` event.

              

            
              - **Minutes** *(integer) --* 

                Contains an integer specifying time in minutes.

                 

                Valid value: 15

                

              
            
          
        
        - **DeleteMarkerReplication** *(dict) --* 

          Specifies whether Amazon S3 replicates delete markers. If you specify a ``Filter`` in your replication configuration, you must also include a ``DeleteMarkerReplication`` element. If your ``Filter`` includes a ``Tag`` element, the ``DeleteMarkerReplication`` ``Status`` must be set to Disabled, because Amazon S3 does not support replicating delete markers for tag-based rules. For an example configuration, see `Basic Rule Configuration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication-add-config.html#replication-config-min-rule-config>`__.

           

          For more information about delete marker replication, see `Basic Rule Configuration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/delete-marker-replication.html>`__.

           

          .. note::

            

            If you are using an earlier version of the replication configuration, Amazon S3 handles replication of delete markers differently. For more information, see `Backward Compatibility <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication-add-config.html#replication-backward-compat-considerations>`__.

            

          

        
          - **Status** *(string) --* 

            Indicates whether to replicate delete markers.

             

            .. note::

              

              Indicates whether to replicate delete markers.

              

            

          
        
      
  
  
  :type Token: string
  :param Token: 

    A token to allow Object Lock to be enabled for an existing bucket.

    

  
  :type ExpectedBucketOwner: string
  :param ExpectedBucketOwner: 

    The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that you provide does not match the actual owner of the bucket, the request fails with the HTTP status code ``403 Forbidden`` (access denied).

    

  
  
  :returns: None

  **Examples**

  The following example sets replication configuration on a bucket.
  ::

    response = client.put_bucket_replication(
        Bucket='examplebucket',
        ReplicationConfiguration={
            'Role': 'arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/examplerole',
            'Rules': [
                {
                    'Destination': {
                        'Bucket': 'arn:aws:s3:::destinationbucket',
                        'StorageClass': 'STANDARD',
                    },
                    'Prefix': '',
                    'Status': 'Enabled',
                },
            ],
        },
    )
    
    print(response)

  
  Expected Output:
  ::

    {
        'ResponseMetadata': {
            '...': '...',
        },
    }
