.. py:method:: S3.Client.get_object_torrent(**kwargs)

  

  .. note::

    

    This operation is not supported for directory buckets.

    

   

  Returns torrent files from a bucket. BitTorrent can save you bandwidth when you're distributing large files.

   

  .. note::

    

    You can get torrent only for objects that are less than 5 GB in size, and that are not encrypted using server-side encryption with a customer-provided encryption key.

    

   

  To use GET, you must have READ access to the object.

   

  This functionality is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

   

  The following action is related to ``GetObjectTorrent``:

   

  
  * `GetObject <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObject.html>`__
  

   

  .. warning::

     

    You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is ``my file.txt``, containing two spaces after ``my``, you must URL encode this value to ``my%20%20file.txt``.
