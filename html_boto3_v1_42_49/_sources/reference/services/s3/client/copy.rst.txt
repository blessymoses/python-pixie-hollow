.. py:method:: S3.Client.copy(CopySource, Bucket, Key, ExtraArgs=None, Callback=None, SourceClient=None, Config=None)

    
  Copy an object from one S3 location to another.
  
  This is a managed transfer which will perform a multipart copy in
  multiple threads if necessary.
  
  Usage::
  
      import boto3
      s3 = boto3.resource('s3')
      copy_source = {
          'Bucket': 'amzn-s3-demo-bucket1',
          'Key': 'mykey'
      }
      s3.meta.client.copy(copy_source, 'amzn-s3-demo-bucket2', 'otherkey')
  
  :type CopySource: dict
  :param CopySource: The name of the source bucket, key name of the
      source object, and optional version ID of the source object. The
      dictionary format is:
      ``{'Bucket': 'bucket', 'Key': 'key', 'VersionId': 'id'}``. Note
      that the ``VersionId`` key is optional and may be omitted.
  
  :type Bucket: str
  :param Bucket: The name of the bucket to copy to
  
  :type Key: str
  :param Key: The name of the key to copy to
  
  :type ExtraArgs: dict
  :param ExtraArgs: Extra arguments that may be passed to the
      client operation. For allowed copy arguments see
      :py:attr:`boto3.s3.transfer.S3Transfer.ALLOWED_COPY_ARGS`.
  
  :type Callback: function
  :param Callback: A method which takes a number of bytes transferred to
      be periodically called during the copy.
  
  :type SourceClient: botocore or boto3 Client
  :param SourceClient: The client to be used for operations that
      may happen at the source object. For example, this client is
      used for the head_object that determines the size of the copy.
      If no client is provided, the current client is used as the
      client for the source object.  The current client still
      requires IAM permissions to access both buckets.
  
  :type Config: boto3.s3.transfer.TransferConfig
  :param Config: The transfer configuration to be used when performing the
      copy.
