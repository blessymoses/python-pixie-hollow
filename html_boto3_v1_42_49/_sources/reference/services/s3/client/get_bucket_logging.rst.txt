.. py:method:: S3.Client.get_bucket_logging(**kwargs)

  

  .. note::

    

    This operation is not supported for directory buckets.

    

   

  Returns the logging status of a bucket and the permissions users have to view and modify that status.

   

  The following operations are related to ``GetBucketLogging``:

   

  
  * `CreateBucket <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateBucket.html>`__
   
  * `PutBucketLogging <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketLogging.html>`__
  

   

  .. warning::

     

    You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is ``my file.txt``, containing two spaces after ``my``, you must URL encode this value to ``my%20%20file.txt``.

  :param Bucket: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The bucket name for which to get the logging information.

    

  
  :type ExpectedBucketOwner: string

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **LoggingEnabled** *(dict) --* 

        Describes where logs are stored and the prefix that Amazon S3 assigns to all log object keys for a bucket. For more information, see `PUT Bucket logging <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTBucketPUTlogging.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 API Reference*.

        
        

        - **TargetBucket** *(string) --* 

          Specifies the bucket where you want Amazon S3 to store server access logs. You can have your logs delivered to any bucket that you own, including the same bucket that is being logged. You can also configure multiple buckets to deliver their logs to the same target bucket. In this case, you should choose a different ``TargetPrefix`` for each source bucket so that the delivered log files can be distinguished by key.

          
        

        - **TargetGrants** *(list) --* 

          Container for granting information.

           

          Buckets that use the bucket owner enforced setting for Object Ownership don't support target grants. For more information, see `Permissions for server access log delivery <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/enable-server-access-logging.html#grant-log-delivery-permissions-general>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            Container for granting information.

            - **Grantee** *(dict) --*

              - **ID** *(string) --* 

                The canonical user ID of the grantee.

                
              

              - **Type** *(string) --* 

                Type of grantee

                
              

              - **URI** *(string) --* 

                URI of the grantee group.

                
          
            

            - **Permission** *(string) --* 

              Logging permissions assigned to the grantee for the bucket.

              
        
      
        

        - **TargetPrefix** *(string) --* 

          A prefix for all log object keys. If you store log files from multiple Amazon S3 buckets in a single bucket, you can use a prefix to distinguish which log files came from which bucket.

          
        

        - **TargetObjectKeyFormat** *(dict) --* 

          Amazon S3 key format for log objects.

          
          

          - **SimplePrefix** *(dict) --* 

            To use the simple format for S3 keys for log objects. To specify SimplePrefix format, set SimplePrefix to {}.

            
        
          

          - **PartitionedPrefix** *(dict) --* 

            Partitioned S3 key for log objects.

            
            

            - **PartitionDateSource** *(string) --* 

              Specifies the partition date source for the partitioned prefix. ``PartitionDateSource`` can be ``EventTime`` or ``DeliveryTime``.

               

              For ``DeliveryTime``, the time in the log file names corresponds to the delivery time for the log files.

               

              For ``EventTime``, The logs delivered are for a specific day only. The year, month, and day correspond to the day on which the event occurred, and the hour, minutes and seconds are set to 00 in the key.
