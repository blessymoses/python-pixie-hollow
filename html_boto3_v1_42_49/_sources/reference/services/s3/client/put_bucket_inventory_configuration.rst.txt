.. py:method:: S3.Client.put_bucket_inventory_configuration(**kwargs)

  

  .. note::

    

    This operation is not supported for directory buckets.

    

   

  This implementation of the ``PUT`` action adds an S3 Inventory configuration (identified by the inventory ID) to the bucket. You can have up to 1,000 inventory configurations per bucket.

   

  Amazon S3 inventory generates inventories of the objects in the bucket on a daily or weekly basis, and the results are published to a flat file. The bucket that is inventoried is called the *source* bucket, and the bucket where the inventory flat file is stored is called the *destination* bucket. The *destination* bucket must be in the same Amazon Web Services Region as the *source* bucket.

   

  When you configure an inventory for a *source* bucket, you specify the *destination* bucket where you want the inventory to be stored, and whether to generate the inventory daily or weekly. You can also configure what object metadata to include and whether to inventory all object versions or only current versions. For more information, see `Amazon S3 Inventory <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-inventory.html>`__ in the Amazon S3 User Guide.

   

  .. warning::

     

    You must create a bucket policy on the *destination* bucket to grant permissions to Amazon S3 to write objects to the bucket in the defined location. For an example policy, see `Granting Permissions for Amazon S3 Inventory and Storage Class Analysis <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/example-bucket-policies.html#example-bucket-policies-use-case-9>`__.

     

    Permissions  

  To use this operation, you must have permission to perform the ``s3:PutInventoryConfiguration`` action. The bucket owner has this permission by default and can grant this permission to others.

   

  The ``s3:PutInventoryConfiguration`` permission allows a user to create an `S3 Inventory <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/storage-inventory.html>`__ report that includes all object metadata fields available and to specify the destination bucket to store the inventory. A user with read access to objects in the destination bucket can also access all object metadata fields that are available in the inventory report.

   

  To restrict access to an inventory report, see `Restricting access to an Amazon S3 Inventory report <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/example-bucket-policies.html#example-bucket-policies-use-case-10>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*. For more information about the metadata fields available in S3 Inventory, see `Amazon S3 Inventory lists <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/storage-inventory.html#storage-inventory-contents>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*. For more information about permissions, see `Permissions related to bucket subresource operations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources>`__ and `Identity and access management in Amazon S3 <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
