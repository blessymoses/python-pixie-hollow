.. py:method:: S3.Client.delete_bucket(**kwargs)

  

  Deletes the S3 bucket. All objects (including all object versions and delete markers) in the bucket must be deleted before the bucket itself can be deleted.

   

  .. note::

    

    
    * **Directory buckets** - If multipart uploads in a directory bucket are in progress, you can't delete the bucket until all the in-progress multipart uploads are aborted or completed.
     
    * **Directory buckets** - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Regional endpoint. These endpoints support path-style requests in the format ``https://s3express-control.region-code.amazonaws.com/bucket-name ``. Virtual-hosted-style requests aren't supported. For more information about endpoints in Availability Zones, see `Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets in Availability Zones <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/endpoint-directory-buckets-AZ.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*. For more information about endpoints in Local Zones, see `Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-lzs-for-directory-buckets.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
    

    

    Permissions  

  
  * **General purpose bucket permissions** - You must have the ``s3:DeleteBucket`` permission on the specified bucket in a policy.
   
  * **Directory bucket permissions** - You must have the ``s3express:DeleteBucket`` permission in an IAM identity-based policy instead of a bucket policy. Cross-account access to this API operation isn't supported. This operation can only be performed by the Amazon Web Services account that owns the resource. For more information about directory bucket policies and permissions, see `Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management (IAM) for S3 Express One Zone <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-security-iam.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
  

    HTTP Host header syntax  

  **Directory buckets** - The HTTP Host header syntax is ``s3express-control.region-code.amazonaws.com``.

     

  The following operations are related to ``DeleteBucket``:

   

  
  * `CreateBucket <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateBucket.html>`__
   
  * `DeleteObject <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_DeleteObject.html>`__
  

   

  .. warning::

     

    You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is ``my file.txt``, containing two spaces after ``my``, you must URL encode this value to ``my%20%20file.txt``.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.delete_bucket(
        Bucket='string',
        ExpectedBucketOwner='string'
    )
    
  :type Bucket: string
  :param Bucket: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies the bucket being deleted.

     

    **Directory buckets** - When you use this operation with a directory bucket, you must use path-style requests in the format ``https://s3express-control.region-code.amazonaws.com/bucket-name ``. Virtual-hosted-style requests aren't supported. Directory bucket names must be unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names must also follow the format ``bucket-base-name--zone-id--x-s3`` (for example, ``DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET--usw2-az1--x-s3``). For information about bucket naming restrictions, see `Directory bucket naming rules <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*

    

  
  :type ExpectedBucketOwner: string
  :param ExpectedBucketOwner: 

    The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that you provide does not match the actual owner of the bucket, the request fails with the HTTP status code ``403 Forbidden`` (access denied).

     

    .. note::

      

      For directory buckets, this header is not supported in this API operation. If you specify this header, the request fails with the HTTP status code ``501 Not Implemented``.

      

    

  
  
  :returns: None

  **Examples**

  The following example deletes the specified bucket.
  ::

    response = client.delete_bucket(
        Bucket='forrandall2',
    )
    
    print(response)

  
  Expected Output:
  ::

    {
        'ResponseMetadata': {
            '...': '...',
        },
    }
