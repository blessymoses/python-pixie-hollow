.. py:method:: S3.Client.put_bucket_lifecycle(**kwargs)

  

  .. note::

    

    This operation is not supported for directory buckets.

    

   

  .. warning::

     

    For an updated version of this API, see `PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration.html>`__. This version has been deprecated. Existing lifecycle configurations will work. For new lifecycle configurations, use the updated API.

     

   

  .. note::

    

    This operation is not supported for directory buckets.

    

   

  Creates a new lifecycle configuration for the bucket or replaces an existing lifecycle configuration. For information about lifecycle configuration, see `Object Lifecycle Management <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

   

  By default, all Amazon S3 resources, including buckets, objects, and related subresources (for example, lifecycle configuration and website configuration) are private. Only the resource owner, the Amazon Web Services account that created the resource, can access it. The resource owner can optionally grant access permissions to others by writing an access policy. For this operation, users must get the ``s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration`` permission.

   

  You can also explicitly deny permissions. Explicit denial also supersedes any other permissions. If you want to prevent users or accounts from removing or deleting objects from your bucket, you must deny them permissions for the following actions:

   

  
  * ``s3:DeleteObject``
   
  * ``s3:DeleteObjectVersion``
   
  * ``s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration``
  

   

  For more information about permissions, see `Managing Access Permissions to your Amazon S3 Resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

   

  For more examples of transitioning objects to storage classes such as STANDARD_IA or ONEZONE_IA, see `Examples of Lifecycle Configuration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/intro-lifecycle-rules.html#lifecycle-configuration-examples>`__.

   

  The following operations are related to ``PutBucketLifecycle``:

   

  
  * `GetBucketLifecycle <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetBucketLifecycle.html>`__(Deprecated)
   
  * `GetBucketLifecycleConfiguration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetBucketLifecycleConfiguration.html>`__
   
  * `RestoreObject <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_RestoreObject.html>`__
   
  * By default, a resource owner—in this case, a bucket owner, which is the Amazon Web Services account that created the bucket—can perform any of the operations. A resource owner can also grant others permission to perform the operation. For more information, see the following topics in the Amazon S3 User Guide: 

    
    * `Specifying Permissions in a Policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-with-s3-actions.html>`__
     
    * `Managing Access Permissions to your Amazon S3 Resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html>`__
    

  
  

   

  .. warning::

     

    You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is ``my file.txt``, containing two spaces after ``my``, you must URL encode this value to ``my%20%20file.txt``.

    

  

  .. danger::

        This operation is deprecated and may not function as expected. This operation should not be used going forward and is only kept for the purpose of backwards compatiblity.

  :type Bucket: string
  :param Bucket: **[REQUIRED]** 

  
  :type ChecksumAlgorithm: string
  :param ChecksumAlgorithm: 

    Indicates the algorithm used to create the checksum for the request when you use the SDK. This header will not provide any additional functionality if you don't use the SDK. When you send this header, there must be a corresponding ``x-amz-checksum`` or ``x-amz-trailer`` header sent. Otherwise, Amazon S3 fails the request with the HTTP status code ``400 Bad Request``. For more information, see `Checking object integrity <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

     

    If you provide an individual checksum, Amazon S3 ignores any provided ``ChecksumAlgorithm`` parameter.

          - **Date** *(datetime) --* 

            Indicates when objects are transitioned to the specified storage class. The date value must be in ISO 8601 format. The time is always midnight UTC.

            

          
          - **Days** *(integer) --* 

            Indicates the number of days after creation when objects are transitioned to the specified storage class. If the specified storage class is ``INTELLIGENT_TIERING``, ``GLACIER_IR``, ``GLACIER``, or ``DEEP_ARCHIVE``, valid values are ``0`` or positive integers. If the specified storage class is ``STANDARD_IA`` or ``ONEZONE_IA``, valid values are positive integers greater than ``30``. Be aware that some storage classes have a minimum storage duration and that you're charged for transitioning objects before their minimum storage duration. For more information, see `Constraints and considerations for transitions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/lifecycle-transition-general-considerations.html#lifecycle-configuration-constraints>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

          Container for the transition rule that describes when noncurrent objects transition to the ``STANDARD_IA``, ``ONEZONE_IA``, ``INTELLIGENT_TIERING``, ``GLACIER_IR``, ``GLACIER``, or ``DEEP_ARCHIVE`` storage class. If your bucket is versioning-enabled (or versioning is suspended), you can set this action to request that Amazon S3 transition noncurrent object versions to the ``STANDARD_IA``, ``ONEZONE_IA``, ``INTELLIGENT_TIERING``, ``GLACIER_IR``, ``GLACIER``, or ``DEEP_ARCHIVE`` storage class at a specific period in the object's lifetime.

          

        
          - **NoncurrentDays** *(integer) --* 

            Specifies the number of days an object is noncurrent before Amazon S3 can perform the associated action. For information about the noncurrent days calculations, see `How Amazon S3 Calculates How Long an Object Has Been Noncurrent <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/intro-lifecycle-rules.html#non-current-days-calculations>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

            

          
          - **StorageClass** *(string) --* 

            The class of storage used to store the object.

            

          
          - **NewerNoncurrentVersions** *(integer) --* 

            Specifies how many noncurrent versions Amazon S3 will retain in the same storage class before transitioning objects. You can specify up to 100 noncurrent versions to retain. Amazon S3 will transition any additional noncurrent versions beyond the specified number to retain.
