  .. warning::

    

    For an updated version of this API, see `GetBucketLifecycleConfiguration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetBucketLifecycleConfiguration.html>`__. If you configured a bucket lifecycle using the ``filter`` element, you should see the updated version of this topic. This topic is provided for backward compatibility.

     

   

  .. note::

    

    This operation is not supported for directory buckets.

    

   

  Returns the lifecycle configuration information set on the bucket. For information about lifecycle configuration, see `Object Lifecycle Management <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html>`__.

   

  To use this operation, you must have permission to perform the ``s3:GetLifecycleConfiguration`` action. The bucket owner has this permission by default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see `Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources>`__ and `Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html>`__.

   

  ``GetBucketLifecycle`` has the following special error:

   

  
  * Error code: ``NoSuchLifecycleConfiguration`` 

    
    * Description: The lifecycle configuration does not exist.
     
    * HTTP Status Code: 404 Not Found

    You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is ``my file.txt``, containing two spaces after ``my``, you must URL encode this value to ``my%20%20file.txt``.

    

  

  .. danger::

        This operation is deprecated and may not function as expected. This operation should not be used going forward and is only kept for the purpose of backwards compatiblity.

              .. note::

                

                This parameter applies to general purpose buckets only. It is not supported for directory bucket lifecycle configurations.

            .. warning::

               

              Replacement must be made for object keys containing special characters (such as carriage returns) when using XML requests. For more information, see `XML related object key constraints <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-keys.html#object-key-xml-related-constraints>`__.

              

            
          

          - **Status** *(string) --* 

            If ``Enabled``, the rule is currently being applied. If ``Disabled``, the rule is not currently being applied.

            
          

          - **Transition** *(dict) --* 

            Specifies when an object transitions to a specified storage class. For more information about Amazon S3 lifecycle configuration rules, see `Transitioning Objects Using Amazon S3 Lifecycle <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/lifecycle-transition-general-considerations.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

            
            

            - **Date** *(datetime) --* 

              Indicates when objects are transitioned to the specified storage class. The date value must be in ISO 8601 format. The time is always midnight UTC.

              
            

            - **Days** *(integer) --* 

              Indicates the number of days after creation when objects are transitioned to the specified storage class. If the specified storage class is ``INTELLIGENT_TIERING``, ``GLACIER_IR``, ``GLACIER``, or ``DEEP_ARCHIVE``, valid values are ``0`` or positive integers. If the specified storage class is ``STANDARD_IA`` or ``ONEZONE_IA``, valid values are positive integers greater than ``30``. Be aware that some storage classes have a minimum storage duration and that you're charged for transitioning objects before their minimum storage duration. For more information, see `Constraints and considerations for transitions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/lifecycle-transition-general-considerations.html#lifecycle-configuration-constraints>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

              
            

            - **StorageClass** *(string) --* 

              The storage class to which you want the object to transition.

              
        
          

          - **NoncurrentVersionTransition** *(dict) --* 

            Container for the transition rule that describes when noncurrent objects transition to the ``STANDARD_IA``, ``ONEZONE_IA``, ``INTELLIGENT_TIERING``, ``GLACIER_IR``, ``GLACIER``, or ``DEEP_ARCHIVE`` storage class. If your bucket is versioning-enabled (or versioning is suspended), you can set this action to request that Amazon S3 transition noncurrent object versions to the ``STANDARD_IA``, ``ONEZONE_IA``, ``INTELLIGENT_TIERING``, ``GLACIER_IR``, ``GLACIER``, or ``DEEP_ARCHIVE`` storage class at a specific period in the object's lifetime.

            
            

            - **NoncurrentDays** *(integer) --* 

              Specifies the number of days an object is noncurrent before Amazon S3 can perform the associated action. For information about the noncurrent days calculations, see `How Amazon S3 Calculates How Long an Object Has Been Noncurrent <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/intro-lifecycle-rules.html#non-current-days-calculations>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

              
            

            - **StorageClass** *(string) --* 

              The class of storage used to store the object.

              
            

            - **NewerNoncurrentVersions** *(integer) --* 

              Specifies how many noncurrent versions Amazon S3 will retain in the same storage class before transitioning objects. You can specify up to 100 noncurrent versions to retain. Amazon S3 will transition any additional noncurrent versions beyond the specified number to retain. For more information about noncurrent versions, see `Lifecycle configuration elements <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/intro-lifecycle-rules.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

              
        
          

          - **NoncurrentVersionExpiration** *(dict) --* 

            Specifies when noncurrent object versions expire. Upon expiration, Amazon S3 permanently deletes the noncurrent object versions. You set this lifecycle configuration action on a bucket that has versioning enabled (or suspended) to request that Amazon S3 delete noncurrent object versions at a specific period in the object's lifetime.

             

            .. note::

              

              This parameter applies to general purpose buckets only. It is not supported for directory bucket lifecycle configurations.

              

            
            

            - **NoncurrentDays** *(integer) --* 

              Specifies the number of days an object is noncurrent before Amazon S3 can perform the associated action. The value must be a non-zero positive integer.

              Specifies how many noncurrent versions Amazon S3 will retain. You can specify up to 100 noncurrent versions to retain. Amazon S3 will permanently delete any additional noncurrent versions beyond the specified number to retain.

          - **AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload** *(dict) --* 

            Specifies the days since the initiation of an incomplete multipart upload that Amazon S3 will wait before permanently removing all parts of the upload. For more information, see `Aborting Incomplete Multipart Uploads Using a Bucket Lifecycle Configuration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html#mpu-abort-incomplete-mpu-lifecycle-config>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

            
            

            - **DaysAfterInitiation** *(integer) --* 

              Specifies the number of days after which Amazon S3 aborts an incomplete multipart upload.
