.. py:method:: S3.Client.get_bucket_notification_configuration(**kwargs)

  

  .. note::

    

    This operation is not supported for directory buckets.

    

   

  Returns the notification configuration of a bucket.

   

  If notifications are not enabled on the bucket, the action returns an empty ``NotificationConfiguration`` element.

   

  By default, you must be the bucket owner to read the notification configuration of a bucket. However, the bucket owner can use a bucket policy to grant permission to other users to read this configuration with the ``s3:GetBucketNotification`` permission.

   

  When you use this API operation with an access point, provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name.

   

  When you use this API operation with an Object Lambda access point, provide the alias of the Object Lambda access point in place of the bucket name. If the Object Lambda access point alias in a request is not valid, the error code ``InvalidAccessPointAliasError`` is returned. For more information about ``InvalidAccessPointAliasError``, see `List of Error Codes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/ErrorResponses.html#ErrorCodeList>`__.

   

  For more information about setting and reading the notification configuration on a bucket, see `Setting Up Notification of Bucket Events <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html>`__. For more information about bucket policies, see `Using Bucket Policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-iam-policies.html>`__.

   

  The following action is related to ``GetBucketNotification``:

   

  
  * `PutBucketNotification <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketNotification.html>`__
  

   

  .. warning::

     

    You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is ``my file.txt``, containing two spaces after ``my``, you must URL encode this value to ``my%20%20file.txt``.

        Bucket='string',
        ExpectedBucketOwner='string'
    )
    
  :type Bucket: string
  :param Bucket: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of the bucket for which to get the notification configuration.

     

    When you use this API operation with an access point, provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name.

     

    When you use this API operation with an Object Lambda access point, provide the alias of the Object Lambda access point in place of the bucket name. If the Object Lambda access point alias in a request is not valid, the error code ``InvalidAccessPointAliasError`` is returned.

  :type ExpectedBucketOwner: string
  :param ExpectedBucketOwner:

You specify whether to filter on the suffix or prefix of the object key name. A prefix is a specific string of characters at the beginning of an object key name, which you can use to organize objects. For example, you can start the key names of related objects with a prefix, such as ``2023-`` or ``engineering/``. Then, you can use ``FilterRule`` to find objects in a bucket with key names that have the same prefix. A suffix is similar to a prefix, but it is at the end of the object key name instead of at the beginning.
