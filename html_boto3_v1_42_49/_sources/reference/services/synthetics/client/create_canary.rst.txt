.. py:method:: Synthetics.Client.create_canary(**kwargs)

  

  Creates a canary. Canaries are scripts that monitor your endpoints and APIs from the outside-in. Canaries help you check the availability and latency of your web services and troubleshoot anomalies by investigating load time data, screenshots of the UI, logs, and metrics. You can set up a canary to run continuously or just once.

   

  Do not use ``CreateCanary`` to modify an existing canary. Use `UpdateCanary <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonSynthetics/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateCanary.html>`__ instead.

   

  To create canaries, you must have the ``CloudWatchSyntheticsFullAccess`` policy. If you are creating a new IAM role for the canary, you also need the ``iam:CreateRole``, ``iam:CreatePolicy`` and ``iam:AttachRolePolicy`` permissions. For more information, see `Necessary Roles and Permissions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries_Roles>`__.

   

  Do not include secrets or proprietary information in your canary names. The canary name makes up part of the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the canary, and the ARN is included in outbound calls over the internet. For more information, see `Security Considerations for Synthetics Canaries <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/servicelens_canaries_security.html>`__.

  :type Name: string
  :param Name: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name for this canary. Be sure to give it a descriptive name that distinguishes it from other canaries in your account.

     

    Do not include secrets or proprietary information in your canary names. The canary name makes up part of the canary ARN, and the ARN is included in outbound calls over the internet. For more information, see `Security Considerations for Synthetics Canaries <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/servicelens_canaries_security.html>`__.

    

  
  :type Code: dict
  :param Code: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A structure that includes the entry point from which the canary should start running your script. If the script is stored in an Amazon S3 bucket, the bucket name, key, and version are also included.

    

  
    - **S3Bucket** *(string) --* 

      If your canary script is located in Amazon S3, specify the bucket name here. Do not include ``s3://`` as the start of the bucket name.

      

    
    - **S3Key** *(string) --* 

      The Amazon S3 key of your script. For more information, see `Working with Amazon S3 Objects <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingObjects.html>`__.

      

    
    - **S3Version** *(string) --* 

      The Amazon S3 version ID of your script.

      

    
    - **ZipFile** *(bytes) --* 

      If you input your canary script directly into the canary instead of referring to an Amazon S3 location, the value of this parameter is the base64-encoded contents of the .zip file that contains the script. It must be smaller than 225 Kb.

       

      For large canary scripts, we recommend that you use an Amazon S3 location instead of inputting it directly with this parameter.

      

    
    - **Handler** *(string) --* 

      The entry point to use for the source code when running the canary. For canaries that use the ``syn-python-selenium-1.0`` runtime or a ``syn-nodejs.puppeteer`` runtime earlier than ``syn-nodejs.puppeteer-3.4``, the handler must be specified as ``fileName.handler``. For ``syn-python-selenium-1.1``, ``syn-nodejs.puppeteer-3.4``, and later runtimes, the handler can be specified as ``fileName.functionName ``, or you can specify a folder where canary scripts reside as ``folder/fileName.functionName ``.

       

      This field is required when you don't specify ``BlueprintTypes`` and is not allowed when you specify ``BlueprintTypes``.

      

    
    - **BlueprintTypes** *(list) --* 

      ``BlueprintTypes`` is a list of templates that enable simplified canary creation. You can create canaries for common monitoring scenarios by providing only a JSON configuration file instead of writing custom scripts. The only supported value is ``multi-checks``.

       

      Multi-checks monitors HTTP/DNS/SSL/TCP endpoints with built-in authentication schemes (Basic, API Key, OAuth, SigV4) and assertion capabilities. When you specify ``BlueprintTypes``, the Handler field cannot be specified since the blueprint provides a pre-defined entry point.

       

      ``BlueprintTypes`` is supported only on canaries for syn-nodejs-3.0 runtime or later.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    - **Dependencies** *(list) --* 

      A list of dependencies that should be used for running this canary. Specify the dependencies as a key-value pair, where the key is the type of dependency and the value is the dependency reference.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        A structure that contains information about a dependency for a canary.

        

      
        - **Type** *(string) --* 

          The type of dependency. Valid value is ``LambdaLayer``.

          

        
        - **Reference** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The dependency reference. For Lambda layers, this is the ARN of the Lambda layer. For more information about Lambda ARN format, see `Lambda <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/api/API_Layer.html>`__.

          

        
      
  
  
  :type ArtifactS3Location: string
  :param ArtifactS3Location: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The location in Amazon S3 where Synthetics stores artifacts from the test runs of this canary. Artifacts include the log file, screenshots, and HAR files. The name of the Amazon S3 bucket can't include a period (.).

    

  
  :type ExecutionRoleArn: string
  :param ExecutionRoleArn: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ARN of the IAM role to be used to run the canary. This role must already exist, and must include ``lambda.amazonaws.com`` as a principal in the trust policy. The role must also have the following permissions:

     

    
    * ``s3:PutObject``
     
    * ``s3:GetBucketLocation``
     
    * ``s3:ListAllMyBuckets``
     
    * ``cloudwatch:PutMetricData``
     
    * ``logs:CreateLogGroup``
     
    * ``logs:CreateLogStream``
     
    * ``logs:PutLogEvents``
    

    

  
  :type Schedule: dict
  :param Schedule: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A structure that contains information about how often the canary is to run and when these test runs are to stop.

    

  
    - **Expression** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      A ``rate`` expression or a ``cron`` expression that defines how often the canary is to run.

       

      For a rate expression, The syntax is ``rate(number unit)``. *unit* can be ``minute``, ``minutes``, or ``hour``.

       

      For example, ``rate(1 minute)`` runs the canary once a minute, ``rate(10 minutes)`` runs it once every 10 minutes, and ``rate(1 hour)`` runs it once every hour. You can specify a frequency between ``rate(1 minute)`` and ``rate(1 hour)``.

       

      Specifying ``rate(0 minute)`` or ``rate(0 hour)`` is a special value that causes the canary to run only once when it is started.

       

      Use ``cron(expression)`` to specify a cron expression. You can't schedule a canary to wait for more than a year before running. For information about the syntax for cron expressions, see `Scheduling canary runs using cron <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries_cron.html>`__.

      

    
    - **DurationInSeconds** *(integer) --* 

      How long, in seconds, for the canary to continue making regular runs according to the schedule in the ``Expression`` value. If you specify 0, the canary continues making runs until you stop it. If you omit this field, the default of 0 is used.

      

    
    - **RetryConfig** *(dict) --* 

      A structure that contains the retry configuration for a canary

      

    
      - **MaxRetries** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The maximum number of retries. The value must be less than or equal to 2.

        

      
    
  
  :type RunConfig: dict
  :param RunConfig: 

    A structure that contains the configuration for individual canary runs, such as timeout value and environment variables.

     

    .. warning::

       

      Environment variable keys and values are encrypted at rest using Amazon Web Services owned KMS keys. However, the environment variables are not encrypted on the client side. Do not store sensitive information in them.

      

    

  
    - **TimeoutInSeconds** *(integer) --* 

      How long the canary is allowed to run before it must stop. You can't set this time to be longer than the frequency of the runs of this canary.

       

      If you omit this field, the frequency of the canary is used as this value, up to a maximum of 14 minutes.

      

    
    - **MemoryInMB** *(integer) --* 

      The maximum amount of memory available to the canary while it is running, in MB. This value must be a multiple of 64.

      

    
    - **ActiveTracing** *(boolean) --* 

      Specifies whether this canary is to use active X-Ray tracing when it runs. Active tracing enables this canary run to be displayed in the ServiceLens and X-Ray service maps even if the canary does not hit an endpoint that has X-Ray tracing enabled. Using X-Ray tracing incurs charges. For more information, see `Canaries and X-Ray tracing <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries_tracing.html>`__.

       

      You can enable active tracing only for canaries that use version ``syn-nodejs-2.0`` or later for their canary runtime.

      

    
    - **EnvironmentVariables** *(dict) --* 

      Specifies the keys and values to use for any environment variables used in the canary script. Use the following format:

       

      { "key1" : "value1", "key2" : "value2", ...}

       

      Keys must start with a letter and be at least two characters. The total size of your environment variables cannot exceed 4 KB. You can't specify any Lambda reserved environment variables as the keys for your environment variables. For more information about reserved keys, see `Runtime environment variables <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-envvars.html#configuration-envvars-runtime>`__.

       

      .. warning::

         

        Environment variable keys and values are encrypted at rest using Amazon Web Services owned KMS keys. However, the environment variables are not encrypted on the client side. Do not store sensitive information in them.

        

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
  

    - **EphemeralStorage** *(integer) --* 

      Specifies the amount of ephemeral storage (in MB) to allocate for the canary run during execution. This temporary storage is used for storing canary run artifacts (which are uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket at the end of the run), and any canary browser operations. This temporary storage is cleared after the run is completed. Default storage value is 1024 MB.

      

    
  
  :type SuccessRetentionPeriodInDays: integer
  :param SuccessRetentionPeriodInDays: 

    The number of days to retain data about successful runs of this canary. If you omit this field, the default of 31 days is used. The valid range is 1 to 455 days.

     

    This setting affects the range of information returned by `GetCanaryRuns <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonSynthetics/latest/APIReference/API_GetCanaryRuns.html>`__, as well as the range of information displayed in the Synthetics console.

    

  
  :type FailureRetentionPeriodInDays: integer
  :param FailureRetentionPeriodInDays: 

    The number of days to retain data about failed runs of this canary. If you omit this field, the default of 31 days is used. The valid range is 1 to 455 days.

     

    This setting affects the range of information returned by `GetCanaryRuns <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonSynthetics/latest/APIReference/API_GetCanaryRuns.html>`__, as well as the range of information displayed in the Synthetics console.

    

  
  :type RuntimeVersion: string
  :param RuntimeVersion: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies the runtime version to use for the canary. For a list of valid runtime versions and more information about runtime versions, see `Canary Runtime Versions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries_Library.html>`__.

    

  
  :type VpcConfig: dict
  :param VpcConfig: 

    If this canary is to test an endpoint in a VPC, this structure contains information about the subnet and security groups of the VPC endpoint. For more information, see `Running a Canary in a VPC <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries_VPC.html>`__.

    

  
    - **SubnetIds** *(list) --* 

      The IDs of the subnets where this canary is to run.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    - **SecurityGroupIds** *(list) --* 

      The IDs of the security groups for this canary.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    - **Ipv6AllowedForDualStack** *(boolean) --* 

      Set this to ``true`` to allow outbound IPv6 traffic on VPC canaries that are connected to dual-stack subnets. The default is ``false``

      

    
  
  :type ResourcesToReplicateTags: list
  :param ResourcesToReplicateTags: 

    To have the tags that you apply to this canary also be applied to the Lambda function that the canary uses, specify this parameter with the value ``lambda-function``.

     

    If you specify this parameter and don't specify any tags in the ``Tags`` parameter, the canary creation fails.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type ProvisionedResourceCleanup: string
  :param ProvisionedResourceCleanup: 

    Specifies whether to also delete the Lambda functions and layers used by this canary when the canary is deleted. If you omit this parameter, the default of ``AUTOMATIC`` is used, which means that the Lambda functions and layers will be deleted when the canary is deleted.

     

    If the value of this parameter is ``OFF``, then the value of the ``DeleteLambda`` parameter of the `DeleteCanary <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonSynthetics/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteCanary.html>`__ operation determines whether the Lambda functions and layers will be deleted.

    

  
  :type BrowserConfigs: list
  :param BrowserConfigs: 

    CloudWatch Synthetics now supports multibrowser canaries for ``syn-nodejs-puppeteer-11.0`` and ``syn-nodejs-playwright-3.0`` runtimes. This feature allows you to run your canaries on both Firefox and Chrome browsers. To create a multibrowser canary, you need to specify the BrowserConfigs with a list of browsers you want to use.

     

    .. note::

      

      If not specified, ``browserConfigs`` defaults to Chrome.

      

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      A structure that specifies the browser type to use for a canary run.

      

    
      - **BrowserType** *(string) --* 

        The browser type associated with this browser configuration.

        

      
    

  :type Tags: dict
  :param Tags: 

    A list of key-value pairs to associate with the canary. You can associate as many as 50 tags with a canary.

     

    Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also use them to scope user permissions, by granting a user permission to access or change only the resources that have certain tag values.

     

    To have the tags that you apply to this canary also be applied to the Lambda function that the canary uses, specify this parameter with the value ``lambda-function``.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    
      - *(string) --* 

      


  :type ArtifactConfig: dict
  :param ArtifactConfig: 

    A structure that contains the configuration for canary artifacts, including the encryption-at-rest settings for artifacts that the canary uploads to Amazon S3.

    

  
    - **S3Encryption** *(dict) --* 

      A structure that contains the configuration of the encryption-at-rest settings for artifacts that the canary uploads to Amazon S3. Artifact encryption functionality is available only for canaries that use Synthetics runtime version syn-nodejs-puppeteer-3.3 or later. For more information, see `Encrypting canary artifacts <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_artifact_encryption.html>`__

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **Canary** *(dict) --* 

        The full details about the canary you have created.

        
        

        - **Id** *(string) --* 

          The unique ID of this canary.

          
        

        - **Name** *(string) --* 

          The name of the canary.

          
        

        - **Code** *(dict) --* 

          This structure contains information about the canary's Lambda handler and where its code is stored by CloudWatch Synthetics.

          
          

          - **SourceLocationArn** *(string) --* 

            The ARN of the Lambda layer where Synthetics stores the canary script code.

            
          

          - **Handler** *(string) --* 

            The entry point to use for the source code when running the canary.

             

            This field is required when you don't specify ``BlueprintTypes`` and is not allowed when you specify ``BlueprintTypes``.

            
          

          - **BlueprintTypes** *(list) --* 

            ``BlueprintTypes`` is a list of templates that enable simplified canary creation. You can create canaries for common monitoring scenarios by providing only a JSON configuration file instead of writing custom scripts. The only supported value is ``multi-checks``.

             

            Multi-checks monitors HTTP/DNS/SSL/TCP endpoints with built-in authentication schemes (Basic, API Key, OAuth, SigV4) and assertion capabilities. When you specify ``BlueprintTypes``, the Handler field cannot be specified since the blueprint provides a pre-defined entry point.

             

            ``BlueprintTypes`` is supported only on canaries for syn-nodejs-3.0 runtime or later.

          - **Expression** *(string) --* 

            A ``rate`` expression or a ``cron`` expression that defines how often the canary is to run.

             

            For a rate expression, The syntax is ``rate(number unit)``. *unit* can be ``minute``, ``minutes``, or ``hour``.

             

            For example, ``rate(1 minute)`` runs the canary once a minute, ``rate(10 minutes)`` runs it once every 10 minutes, and ``rate(1 hour)`` runs it once every hour. You can specify a frequency between ``rate(1 minute)`` and ``rate(1 hour)``.

             

            Specifying ``rate(0 minute)`` or ``rate(0 hour)`` is a special value that causes the canary to run only once when it is started.

             

            Use ``cron(expression)`` to specify a cron expression. For information about the syntax for cron expressions, see `Scheduling canary runs using cron <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries_cron.html>`__.
