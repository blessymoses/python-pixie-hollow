    )
    
  :type Name: string
  :param Name: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of the canary that you want to dry run. To find canary names, use `DescribeCanaries <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonSynthetics/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeCanaries.html>`__.

    

  
  :type Code: dict
  :param Code: 

    Use this structure to input your script code for the canary. This structure contains the Lambda handler with the location where the canary should start running the script. If the script is stored in an Amazon S3 bucket, the bucket name, key, and version are also included. If the script was passed into the canary directly, the script code is contained in the value of ``Zipfile``.

     

    If you are uploading your canary scripts with an Amazon S3 bucket, your zip file should include your script in a certain folder structure.

     

    
    * For Node.js canaries, the folder structure must be ``nodejs/node_modules/myCanaryFilename.js`` For more information, see `Packaging your Node.js canary files <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries_WritingCanary_Nodejs.html#CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries_package>`__
     
    * For Python canaries, the folder structure must be ``python/myCanaryFilename.py`` or ``python/myFolder/myCanaryFilename.py`` For more information, see `Packaging your Python canary files <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries_WritingCanary_Python.html#CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries_WritingCanary_Python_package>`__
    

    

  
    - **S3Bucket** *(string) --* 

      If your canary script is located in Amazon S3, specify the bucket name here. Do not include ``s3://`` as the start of the bucket name.

      

    
    - **S3Key** *(string) --* 

      The Amazon S3 key of your script. For more information, see `Working with Amazon S3 Objects <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingObjects.html>`__.

      

    
    - **S3Version** *(string) --* 

      The Amazon S3 version ID of your script.

      

    
    - **ZipFile** *(bytes) --* 

      If you input your canary script directly into the canary instead of referring to an Amazon S3 location, the value of this parameter is the base64-encoded contents of the .zip file that contains the script. It must be smaller than 225 Kb.

       

      For large canary scripts, we recommend that you use an Amazon S3 location instead of inputting it directly with this parameter.

      

    
    - **Handler** *(string) --* 

      The entry point to use for the source code when running the canary. For canaries that use the ``syn-python-selenium-1.0`` runtime or a ``syn-nodejs.puppeteer`` runtime earlier than ``syn-nodejs.puppeteer-3.4``, the handler must be specified as ``fileName.handler``. For ``syn-python-selenium-1.1``, ``syn-nodejs.puppeteer-3.4``, and later runtimes, the handler can be specified as ``fileName.functionName ``, or you can specify a folder where canary scripts reside as ``folder/fileName.functionName ``.

       

      This field is required when you don't specify ``BlueprintTypes`` and is not allowed when you specify ``BlueprintTypes``.

      

    
    - **BlueprintTypes** *(list) --* 

      ``BlueprintTypes`` is a list of templates that enable simplified canary creation. You can create canaries for common monitoring scenarios by providing only a JSON configuration file instead of writing custom scripts. The only supported value is ``multi-checks``.

       

      Multi-checks monitors HTTP/DNS/SSL/TCP endpoints with built-in authentication schemes (Basic, API Key, OAuth, SigV4) and assertion capabilities. When you specify ``BlueprintTypes``, the Handler field cannot be specified since the blueprint provides a pre-defined entry point.

       

      ``BlueprintTypes`` is supported only on canaries for syn-nodejs-3.0 runtime or later.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    - **Dependencies** *(list) --* 

      A list of dependencies that should be used for running this canary. Specify the dependencies as a key-value pair, where the key is the type of dependency and the value is the dependency reference.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        A structure that contains information about a dependency for a canary.

        

      
        - **Type** *(string) --* 

          The type of dependency. Valid value is ``LambdaLayer``.

          

        
        - **Reference** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The dependency reference. For Lambda layers, this is the ARN of the Lambda layer. For more information about Lambda ARN format, see `Lambda <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/api/API_Layer.html>`__.

          

        
      
  
  
  :type RuntimeVersion: string
  :param RuntimeVersion: 

    Specifies the runtime version to use for the canary. For a list of valid runtime versions and for more information about runtime versions, see `Canary Runtime Versions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries_Library.html>`__.

    

  
  :type RunConfig: dict
  :param RunConfig: 

    A structure that contains input information for a canary run.

    

  
    - **TimeoutInSeconds** *(integer) --* 

      How long the canary is allowed to run before it must stop. You can't set this time to be longer than the frequency of the runs of this canary.

       

      If you omit this field, the frequency of the canary is used as this value, up to a maximum of 14 minutes.

      

    
    - **MemoryInMB** *(integer) --* 

      The maximum amount of memory available to the canary while it is running, in MB. This value must be a multiple of 64.

      

    
    - **ActiveTracing** *(boolean) --* 

      Specifies whether this canary is to use active X-Ray tracing when it runs. Active tracing enables this canary run to be displayed in the ServiceLens and X-Ray service maps even if the canary does not hit an endpoint that has X-Ray tracing enabled. Using X-Ray tracing incurs charges. For more information, see `Canaries and X-Ray tracing <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries_tracing.html>`__.

       

      You can enable active tracing only for canaries that use version ``syn-nodejs-2.0`` or later for their canary runtime.

      

    
    - **EnvironmentVariables** *(dict) --* 

      Specifies the keys and values to use for any environment variables used in the canary script. Use the following format:

       

      { "key1" : "value1", "key2" : "value2", ...}

       

      Keys must start with a letter and be at least two characters. The total size of your environment variables cannot exceed 4 KB. You can't specify any Lambda reserved environment variables as the keys for your environment variables. For more information about reserved keys, see `Runtime environment variables <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-envvars.html#configuration-envvars-runtime>`__.

       

      .. warning::

         

        Environment variable keys and values are encrypted at rest using Amazon Web Services owned KMS keys. However, the environment variables are not encrypted on the client side. Do not store sensitive information in them.

        

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
  

    - **EphemeralStorage** *(integer) --* 

      Specifies the amount of ephemeral storage (in MB) to allocate for the canary run during execution. This temporary storage is used for storing canary run artifacts (which are uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket at the end of the run), and any canary browser operations. This temporary storage is cleared after the run is completed. Default storage value is 1024 MB.

      

    
  
  :type VpcConfig: dict
  :param VpcConfig: 

    If this canary is to test an endpoint in a VPC, this structure contains information about the subnets and security groups of the VPC endpoint. For more information, see `Running a Canary in a VPC <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries_VPC.html>`__.

      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    - **Ipv6AllowedForDualStack** *(boolean) --* 

      Set this to ``true`` to allow outbound IPv6 traffic on VPC canaries that are connected to dual-stack subnets. The default is ``false``

      

    
  
  :type ExecutionRoleArn: string
  :param ExecutionRoleArn: 

    The ARN of the IAM role to be used to run the canary. This role must already exist, and must include ``lambda.amazonaws.com`` as a principal in the trust policy. The role must also have the following permissions:

    

  
  :type SuccessRetentionPeriodInDays: integer
  :param SuccessRetentionPeriodInDays: 

    The number of days to retain data about successful runs of this canary. If you omit this field, the default of 31 days is used. The valid range is 1 to 455 days.

     

    This setting affects the range of information returned by `GetCanaryRuns <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonSynthetics/latest/APIReference/API_GetCanaryRuns.html>`__, as well as the range of information displayed in the Synthetics console.

    

  
  :type FailureRetentionPeriodInDays: integer
  :param FailureRetentionPeriodInDays: 

    The number of days to retain data about failed runs of this canary. If you omit this field, the default of 31 days is used. The valid range is 1 to 455 days.

     

    This setting affects the range of information returned by `GetCanaryRuns <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonSynthetics/latest/APIReference/API_GetCanaryRuns.html>`__, as well as the range of information displayed in the Synthetics console.

    

  
  :type VisualReference: dict
  :param VisualReference: 

    An object that specifies what screenshots to use as a baseline for visual monitoring by this canary. It can optionally also specify parts of the screenshots to ignore during the visual monitoring comparison.

     

    Visual monitoring is supported only on canaries running the **syn-puppeteer-node-3.2** runtime or later. For more information, see `Visual monitoring <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Library_SyntheticsLogger_VisualTesting.html>`__ and `Visual monitoring blueprint <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries_Blueprints_VisualTesting.html>`__

    

  
    - **BaseScreenshots** *(list) --*

        A structure representing a screenshot that is used as a baseline during visual monitoring comparisons made by the canary.

        

      
        - **ScreenshotName** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The name of the screenshot. This is generated the first time the canary is run after the ``UpdateCanary`` operation that specified for this canary to perform visual monitoring.

          

        
        - **IgnoreCoordinates** *(list) --* 

          Coordinates that define the part of a screen to ignore during screenshot comparisons. To obtain the coordinates to use here, use the CloudWatch console to draw the boundaries on the screen. For more information, see `Editing or deleting a canary <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/synthetics_canaries_deletion.html>`__

          

        
          - *(string) --* 

          
      
      
  
    - **BaseCanaryRunId** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      Specifies which canary run to use the screenshots from as the baseline for future visual monitoring with this canary. Valid values are ``nextrun`` to use the screenshots from the next run after this update is made, ``lastrun`` to use the screenshots from the most recent run before this update was made, or the value of ``Id`` in the `CanaryRun <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonSynthetics/latest/APIReference/API_CanaryRun.html>`__ from a run of this a canary in the past 31 days. If you specify the ``Id`` of a canary run older than 31 days, the operation returns a 400 validation exception error..

      

    
    - **BrowserType** *(string) --* 

      The browser type associated with this visual reference.

      

    
  
  :type ArtifactS3Location: string
  :param ArtifactS3Location: 

    The location in Amazon S3 where Synthetics stores artifacts from the test runs of this canary. Artifacts include the log file, screenshots, and HAR files. The name of the Amazon S3 bucket can't include a period (.).

    

  
  :type ArtifactConfig: dict
  :param ArtifactConfig: 

    A structure that contains the configuration for canary artifacts, including the encryption-at-rest settings for artifacts that the canary uploads to Amazon S3.

    

  
    - **S3Encryption** *(dict) --* 

      A structure that contains the configuration of the encryption-at-rest settings for artifacts that the canary uploads to Amazon S3. Artifact encryption functionality is available only for canaries that use Synthetics runtime version syn-nodejs-puppeteer-3.3 or later. For more information, see `Encrypting canary artifacts <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_artifact_encryption.html>`__

      

    
      - **EncryptionMode** *(string) --* 

        The encryption method to use for artifacts created by this canary. Specify ``SSE_S3`` to use server-side encryption (SSE) with an Amazon S3-managed key. Specify ``SSE-KMS`` to use server-side encryption with a customer-managed KMS key.

         

        If you omit this parameter, an Amazon Web Services-managed KMS key is used.

        

      
      - **KmsKeyArn** *(string) --* 

        The ARN of the customer-managed KMS key to use, if you specify ``SSE-KMS`` for ``EncryptionMode``

        

      
    
  
  :type ProvisionedResourceCleanup: string
  :param ProvisionedResourceCleanup: 

    Specifies whether to also delete the Lambda functions and layers used by this canary when the canary is deleted. If you omit this parameter, the default of ``AUTOMATIC`` is used, which means that the Lambda functions and layers will be deleted when the canary is deleted.

     

    If the value of this parameter is ``OFF``, then the value of the ``DeleteLambda`` parameter of the `DeleteCanary <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonSynthetics/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteCanary.html>`__ operation determines whether the Lambda functions and layers will be deleted.

    

  
  :type BrowserConfigs: list
  :param BrowserConfigs:
