.. py:method:: Synthetics.Client.delete_canary(**kwargs)

  

  Permanently deletes the specified canary.

   

  If the canary's ``ProvisionedResourceCleanup`` field is set to ``AUTOMATIC`` or you specify ``DeleteLambda`` in this operation as ``true``, CloudWatch Synthetics also deletes the Lambda functions and layers that are used by the canary.

   

  Other resources used and created by the canary are not automatically deleted. After you delete a canary, you should also delete the following:

   

  
  * The CloudWatch alarms created for this canary. These alarms have a name of ``Synthetics-Alarm-first-198-characters-of-canary-name-canaryId-alarm number``
   
  * Amazon S3 objects and buckets, such as the canary's artifact location.
   
  * IAM roles created for the canary. If they were created in the console, these roles have the name ``role/service-role/CloudWatchSyntheticsRole-First-21-Characters-of-CanaryName``
   
  * CloudWatch Logs log groups created for the canary. These logs groups have the name ``/aws/lambda/cwsyn-First-21-Characters-of-CanaryName``
  

   

  Before you delete a canary, you might want to use ``GetCanary`` to display the information about this canary. Make note of the information returned by this operation so that you can delete these resources after you delete the canary.

  ::

    response = client.delete_canary(

        DeleteLambda=True|False
    )
    
  :type Name: string
  :param Name: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of the canary that you want to delete. To find the names of your canaries, use `DescribeCanaries <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonSynthetics/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeCanaries.html>`__.

    

  
  :type DeleteLambda: boolean
  :param DeleteLambda: 

    Specifies whether to also delete the Lambda functions and layers used by this canary. The default is ``false``.

     

    Your setting for this parameter is used only if the canary doesn't have ``AUTOMATIC`` for its ``ProvisionedResourceCleanup`` field. If that field is set to ``AUTOMATIC``, then the Lambda functions and layers will be deleted when this canary is deleted.
