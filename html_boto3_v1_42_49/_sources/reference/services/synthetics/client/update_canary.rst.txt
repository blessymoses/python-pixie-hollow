.. py:method:: Synthetics.Client.update_canary(**kwargs)

  

  Updates the configuration of a canary that has already been created.

   

  For multibrowser canaries, you can add or remove browsers by updating the browserConfig list in the update call. For example:

   

  
  * To add Firefox to a canary that currently uses Chrome, specify browserConfigs as [CHROME, FIREFOX]
   
  * To remove Firefox and keep only Chrome, specify browserConfigs as [CHROME]
  

   

  You can't use this operation to update the tags of an existing canary. To change the tags of an existing canary, use `TagResource <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonSynthetics/latest/APIReference/API_TagResource.html>`__.

   

  .. note::

    

    When you use the ``dryRunId`` field when updating a canary, the only other field you can provide is the ``Schedule``. Adding any other field will thrown an exception.

  :type Name: string
  :param Name: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of the canary that you want to update. To find the names of your canaries, use `DescribeCanaries <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonSynthetics/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeCanaries.html>`__.

     

    You cannot change the name of a canary that has already been created.

    

  
  :type Code: dict
  :param Code: 

    A structure that includes the entry point from which the canary should start running your script. If the script is stored in an Amazon S3 bucket, the bucket name, key, and version are also included.

    

  
    - **S3Bucket** *(string) --* 

      If your canary script is located in Amazon S3, specify the bucket name here. Do not include ``s3://`` as the start of the bucket name.

      

    
    - **S3Key** *(string) --* 

      The Amazon S3 key of your script. For more information, see `Working with Amazon S3 Objects <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingObjects.html>`__.

      

    
    - **S3Version** *(string) --* 

      The Amazon S3 version ID of your script.

      

    
    - **ZipFile** *(bytes) --* 

      If you input your canary script directly into the canary instead of referring to an Amazon S3 location, the value of this parameter is the base64-encoded contents of the .zip file that contains the script. It must be smaller than 225 Kb.

       

      For large canary scripts, we recommend that you use an Amazon S3 location instead of inputting it directly with this parameter.

      

    
    - **Handler** *(string) --* 

      The entry point to use for the source code when running the canary. For canaries that use the ``syn-python-selenium-1.0`` runtime or a ``syn-nodejs.puppeteer`` runtime earlier than ``syn-nodejs.puppeteer-3.4``, the handler must be specified as ``fileName.handler``. For ``syn-python-selenium-1.1``, ``syn-nodejs.puppeteer-3.4``, and later runtimes, the handler can be specified as ``fileName.functionName ``, or you can specify a folder where canary scripts reside as ``folder/fileName.functionName ``.

       

      This field is required when you don't specify ``BlueprintTypes`` and is not allowed when you specify ``BlueprintTypes``.

      

    
    - **BlueprintTypes** *(list) --* 

      ``BlueprintTypes`` is a list of templates that enable simplified canary creation. You can create canaries for common monitoring scenarios by providing only a JSON configuration file instead of writing custom scripts. The only supported value is ``multi-checks``.

       

      Multi-checks monitors HTTP/DNS/SSL/TCP endpoints with built-in authentication schemes (Basic, API Key, OAuth, SigV4) and assertion capabilities. When you specify ``BlueprintTypes``, the Handler field cannot be specified since the blueprint provides a pre-defined entry point.

       

      ``BlueprintTypes`` is supported only on canaries for syn-nodejs-3.0 runtime or later.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    - **Dependencies** *(list) --* 

      A list of dependencies that should be used for running this canary. Specify the dependencies as a key-value pair, where the key is the type of dependency and the value is the dependency reference.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        A structure that contains information about a dependency for a canary.

        

      
        - **Type** *(string) --* 

          The type of dependency. Valid value is ``LambdaLayer``.

          

        
        - **Reference** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The dependency reference. For Lambda layers, this is the ARN of the Lambda layer. For more information about Lambda ARN format, see `Lambda <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/api/API_Layer.html>`__.

          

        
      
  
  
  :type ExecutionRoleArn: string
  :param ExecutionRoleArn: 

    The ARN of the IAM role to be used to run the canary. This role must already exist, and must include ``lambda.amazonaws.com`` as a principal in the trust policy. The role must also have the following permissions:

     

    
    * ``s3:PutObject``
     
    * ``s3:GetBucketLocation``
     
    * ``s3:ListAllMyBuckets``
     
    * ``cloudwatch:PutMetricData``
     
    * ``logs:CreateLogGroup``
     
    * ``logs:CreateLogStream``
     
    * ``logs:CreateLogStream``
    

    

  
  :type RuntimeVersion: string
  :param RuntimeVersion: 

    Specifies the runtime version to use for the canary. For a list of valid runtime versions and for more information about runtime versions, see `Canary Runtime Versions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries_Library.html>`__.

    

  
  :type Schedule: dict
  :param Schedule: 

    A structure that contains information about how often the canary is to run, and when these runs are to stop.

    

  
    - **Expression** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      A ``rate`` expression or a ``cron`` expression that defines how often the canary is to run.

       

      For a rate expression, The syntax is ``rate(number unit)``. *unit* can be ``minute``, ``minutes``, or ``hour``.

       

      For example, ``rate(1 minute)`` runs the canary once a minute, ``rate(10 minutes)`` runs it once every 10 minutes, and ``rate(1 hour)`` runs it once every hour. You can specify a frequency between ``rate(1 minute)`` and ``rate(1 hour)``.

       

      Specifying ``rate(0 minute)`` or ``rate(0 hour)`` is a special value that causes the canary to run only once when it is started.

       

      Use ``cron(expression)`` to specify a cron expression. You can't schedule a canary to wait for more than a year before running. For information about the syntax for cron expressions, see `Scheduling canary runs using cron <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries_cron.html>`__.

      

    
    - **DurationInSeconds** *(integer) --* 

      How long, in seconds, for the canary to continue making regular runs according to the schedule in the ``Expression`` value. If you specify 0, the canary continues making runs until you stop it. If you omit this field, the default of 0 is used.

      

    
    - **RetryConfig** *(dict) --* 

      A structure that contains the retry configuration for a canary

      

    
      - **MaxRetries** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The maximum number of retries. The value must be less than or equal to 2.

        

      
    
  
  :type RunConfig: dict
  :param RunConfig: 

    A structure that contains the timeout value that is used for each individual run of the canary.

     

    .. warning::

       

      Environment variable keys and values are encrypted at rest using Amazon Web Services owned KMS keys. However, the environment variables are not encrypted on the client side. Do not store sensitive information in them.

      

    

  
    - **TimeoutInSeconds** *(integer) --* 

      How long the canary is allowed to run before it must stop. You can't set this time to be longer than the frequency of the runs of this canary.

       

      If you omit this field, the frequency of the canary is used as this value, up to a maximum of 14 minutes.

      

    
    - **MemoryInMB** *(integer) --* 

      The maximum amount of memory available to the canary while it is running, in MB. This value must be a multiple of 64.

      

    
    - **ActiveTracing** *(boolean) --* 

      Specifies whether this canary is to use active X-Ray tracing when it runs. Active tracing enables this canary run to be displayed in the ServiceLens and X-Ray service maps even if the canary does not hit an endpoint that has X-Ray tracing enabled. Using X-Ray tracing incurs charges. For more information, see `Canaries and X-Ray tracing <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries_tracing.html>`__.

       

      You can enable active tracing only for canaries that use version ``syn-nodejs-2.0`` or later for their canary runtime.

      

    
    - **EnvironmentVariables** *(dict) --* 

      Specifies the keys and values to use for any environment variables used in the canary script. Use the following format:

       

      { "key1" : "value1", "key2" : "value2", ...}

       

      Keys must start with a letter and be at least two characters. The total size of your environment variables cannot exceed 4 KB. You can't specify any Lambda reserved environment variables as the keys for your environment variables. For more information about reserved keys, see `Runtime environment variables <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-envvars.html#configuration-envvars-runtime>`__.

       

      .. warning::

         

        Environment variable keys and values are encrypted at rest using Amazon Web Services owned KMS keys. However, the environment variables are not encrypted on the client side. Do not store sensitive information in them.

        

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
  

    - **EphemeralStorage** *(integer) --* 

      Specifies the amount of ephemeral storage (in MB) to allocate for the canary run during execution. This temporary storage is used for storing canary run artifacts (which are uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket at the end of the run), and any canary browser operations. This temporary storage is cleared after the run is completed. Default storage value is 1024 MB.

  :type FailureRetentionPeriodInDays: integer
  :param FailureRetentionPeriodInDays: 

    The number of days to retain data about failed runs of this canary.

     

    This setting affects the range of information returned by `GetCanaryRuns <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonSynthetics/latest/APIReference/API_GetCanaryRuns.html>`__, as well as the range of information displayed in the Synthetics console.

    

  
  :type VpcConfig: dict
  :param VpcConfig: 

    If this canary is to test an endpoint in a VPC, this structure contains information about the subnet and security groups of the VPC endpoint. For more information, see `Running a Canary in a VPC <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries_VPC.html>`__.

    

  
    - **SubnetIds** *(list) --* 

      The IDs of the subnets where this canary is to run.

      

    
      - *(string) --*

  :type VisualReference: dict
  :param VisualReference: 

    Defines the screenshots to use as the baseline for comparisons during visual monitoring comparisons during future runs of this canary. If you omit this parameter, no changes are made to any baseline screenshots that the canary might be using already.

     

    Visual monitoring is supported only on canaries running the **syn-puppeteer-node-3.2** runtime or later. For more information, see `Visual monitoring <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Library_SyntheticsLogger_VisualTesting.html>`__ and `Visual monitoring blueprint <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries_Blueprints_VisualTesting.html>`__

    

  
    - **BaseScreenshots** *(list) --* 

      An array of screenshots that will be used as the baseline for visual monitoring in future runs of this canary. If there is a screenshot that you don't want to be used for visual monitoring, remove it from this array.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        A structure representing a screenshot that is used as a baseline during visual monitoring comparisons made by the canary.

        

      
        - **ScreenshotName** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The name of the screenshot. This is generated the first time the canary is run after the ``UpdateCanary`` operation that specified for this canary to perform visual monitoring.

          

        
        - **IgnoreCoordinates** *(list) --* 

          Coordinates that define the part of a screen to ignore during screenshot comparisons. To obtain the coordinates to use here, use the CloudWatch console to draw the boundaries on the screen. For more information, see `Editing or deleting a canary <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/synthetics_canaries_deletion.html>`__

          

        
          - *(string) --* 

          
      
      
  
    - **BaseCanaryRunId** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      Specifies which canary run to use the screenshots from as the baseline for future visual monitoring with this canary. Valid values are ``nextrun`` to use the screenshots from the next run after this update is made, ``lastrun`` to use the screenshots from the most recent run before this update was made, or the value of ``Id`` in the `CanaryRun <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonSynthetics/latest/APIReference/API_CanaryRun.html>`__ from a run of this a canary in the past 31 days. If you specify the ``Id`` of a canary run older than 31 days, the operation returns a 400 validation exception error..

      

    
    - **BrowserType** *(string) --* 

      The browser type associated with this visual reference.

      

    
  
  :type ArtifactS3Location: string
  :param ArtifactS3Location: 

    The location in Amazon S3 where Synthetics stores artifacts from the test runs of this canary. Artifacts include the log file, screenshots, and HAR files. The name of the Amazon S3 bucket can't include a period (.).

    

  
  :type ArtifactConfig: dict
  :param ArtifactConfig: 

    A structure that contains the configuration for canary artifacts, including the encryption-at-rest settings for artifacts that the canary uploads to Amazon S3.

    

  
    - **S3Encryption** *(dict) --* 

      A structure that contains the configuration of the encryption-at-rest settings for artifacts that the canary uploads to Amazon S3. Artifact encryption functionality is available only for canaries that use Synthetics runtime version syn-nodejs-puppeteer-3.3 or later. For more information, see `Encrypting canary artifacts <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_artifact_encryption.html>`__

      

    
      - **EncryptionMode** *(string) --* 

        The encryption method to use for artifacts created by this canary. Specify ``SSE_S3`` to use server-side encryption (SSE) with an Amazon S3-managed key. Specify ``SSE-KMS`` to use server-side encryption with a customer-managed KMS key.

         

        If you omit this parameter, an Amazon Web Services-managed KMS key is used.

        

      
      - **KmsKeyArn** *(string) --* 

        The ARN of the customer-managed KMS key to use, if you specify ``SSE-KMS`` for ``EncryptionMode``

        

      
    
  
  :type ProvisionedResourceCleanup: string
  :param ProvisionedResourceCleanup: 

    Specifies whether to also delete the Lambda functions and layers used by this canary when the canary is deleted.

     

    If the value of this parameter is ``OFF``, then the value of the ``DeleteLambda`` parameter of the `DeleteCanary <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonSynthetics/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteCanary.html>`__ operation determines whether the Lambda functions and layers will be deleted.

    

  
  :type DryRunId: string
  :param DryRunId: 

    Update the existing canary using the updated configurations from the DryRun associated with the DryRunId.

     

    .. note::

      

      When you use the ``dryRunId`` field when updating a canary, the only other field you can provide is the ``Schedule``. Adding any other field will thrown an exception.

      

    

  
  :type VisualReferences: list
  :param VisualReferences: 

    A list of visual reference configurations for the canary, one for each browser type that the canary is configured to run on. Visual references are used for visual monitoring comparisons.

     

    ``syn-nodejs-puppeteer-11.0`` and above, and ``syn-nodejs-playwright-3.0`` and above, only supports ``visualReferences``. ``visualReference`` field is not supported.

     

    Versions older than ``syn-nodejs-puppeteer-11.0`` supports both ``visualReference`` and ``visualReferences`` for backward compatibility. It is recommended to use ``visualReferences`` for consistency and future compatibility.

     

    For multibrowser visual monitoring, you can update the baseline for all configured browsers in a single update call by specifying a list of VisualReference objects, one per browser. Each VisualReference object maps to a specific browser configuration, allowing you to manage visual baselines for multiple browsers simultaneously.

     

    For single configuration canaries using Chrome browser (default browser), use visualReferences for ``syn-nodejs-puppeteer-11.0`` and above, and ``syn-nodejs-playwright-3.0`` and above canaries. The browserType in the visualReference object is not mandatory.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      An object that specifies what screenshots to use as a baseline for visual monitoring by this canary. It can optionally also specify parts of the screenshots to ignore during the visual monitoring comparison.

       

      Visual monitoring is supported only on canaries running the **syn-puppeteer-node-3.2** runtime or later. For more information, see `Visual monitoring <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Library_SyntheticsLogger_VisualTesting.html>`__ and `Visual monitoring blueprint <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries_Blueprints_VisualTesting.html>`__
