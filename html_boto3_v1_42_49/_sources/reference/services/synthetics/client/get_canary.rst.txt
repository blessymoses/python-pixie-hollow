    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **Canary** *(dict) --* 

        A structure that contains the full information about the canary.

        
        

        - **Id** *(string) --* 

          The unique ID of this canary.

          
        

        - **Name** *(string) --* 

          The name of the canary.

          
        

        - **Code** *(dict) --* 

          This structure contains information about the canary's Lambda handler and where its code is stored by CloudWatch Synthetics.

          
          

          - **SourceLocationArn** *(string) --* 

            The ARN of the Lambda layer where Synthetics stores the canary script code.

            
          

          - **Handler** *(string) --* 

            The entry point to use for the source code when running the canary.

             

            This field is required when you don't specify ``BlueprintTypes`` and is not allowed when you specify ``BlueprintTypes``.

            
          

          - **BlueprintTypes** *(list) --* 

            ``BlueprintTypes`` is a list of templates that enable simplified canary creation. You can create canaries for common monitoring scenarios by providing only a JSON configuration file instead of writing custom scripts. The only supported value is ``multi-checks``.

             

            Multi-checks monitors HTTP/DNS/SSL/TCP endpoints with built-in authentication schemes (Basic, API Key, OAuth, SigV4) and assertion capabilities. When you specify ``BlueprintTypes``, the Handler field cannot be specified since the blueprint provides a pre-defined entry point.

             

            ``BlueprintTypes`` is supported only on canaries for syn-nodejs-3.0 runtime or later.

            
            

            - *(string) --* 
        
          

          - **Dependencies** *(list) --*

            - *(dict) --* 

              A structure that contains information about a dependency for a canary.

              
              

              - **Type** *(string) --* 

                The type of dependency. Valid value is ``LambdaLayer``.

                
              

              - **Reference** *(string) --* 

                The dependency reference. For Lambda layers, this is the ARN of the Lambda layer. For more information about Lambda ARN format, see `Lambda <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/api/API_Layer.html>`__.

                
          
        
      
        

        - **ExecutionRoleArn** *(string) --* 

          The ARN of the IAM role used to run the canary. This role must include ``lambda.amazonaws.com`` as a principal in the trust policy.

          
        

        - **Schedule** *(dict) --*

          - **Expression** *(string) --* 

            A ``rate`` expression or a ``cron`` expression that defines how often the canary is to run.

             

            For a rate expression, The syntax is ``rate(number unit)``. *unit* can be ``minute``, ``minutes``, or ``hour``.

             

            For example, ``rate(1 minute)`` runs the canary once a minute, ``rate(10 minutes)`` runs it once every 10 minutes, and ``rate(1 hour)`` runs it once every hour. You can specify a frequency between ``rate(1 minute)`` and ``rate(1 hour)``.

             

            Specifying ``rate(0 minute)`` or ``rate(0 hour)`` is a special value that causes the canary to run only once when it is started.

             

            Use ``cron(expression)`` to specify a cron expression. For information about the syntax for cron expressions, see `Scheduling canary runs using cron <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries_cron.html>`__.

          If the value of this parameter is ``OFF``, then the value of the ``DeleteLambda`` parameter of the `DeleteCanary <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonSynthetics/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteCanary.html>`__ operation determines whether the Lambda functions and layers will be deleted.

          
        

        - **BrowserConfigs** *(list) --* 

          A structure that specifies the browser type to use for a canary run. CloudWatch Synthetics supports running canaries on both ``CHROME`` and ``FIREFOX`` browsers.

           

          .. note::

            

            If not specified, ``browserConfigs`` defaults to Chrome.

            

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            A structure that specifies the browser type to use for a canary run.

            
            

            - **BrowserType** *(string) --* 

              The browser type associated with this browser configuration.

              
        
      
        

        - **EngineConfigs** *(list) --* 

          A list of engine configurations for the canary, one for each browser type that the canary is configured to run on.

           

          All runtime versions ``syn-nodejs-puppeteer-11.0`` and above, and ``syn-nodejs-playwright-3.0`` and above, use ``engineConfigs`` only. You can no longer use ``engineArn`` in these versions.

           

          Runtime versions older than ``syn-nodejs-puppeteer-11.0`` and ``syn-nodejs-playwright-3.0`` continue to support ``engineArn`` to ensure backward compatibility.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            A structure of engine configurations for the canary, one for each browser type that the canary is configured to run on.

            
            

            - **EngineArn** *(string) --* 

              Each engine configuration contains the ARN of the Lambda function that is used as the canary's engine for a specific browser type.

              
            

            - **BrowserType** *(string) --*

        - **VisualReferences** *(list) --* 

          A list of visual reference configurations for the canary, one for each browser type that the canary is configured to run on. Visual references are used for visual monitoring comparisons.

           

          ``syn-nodejs-puppeteer-11.0`` and above, and ``syn-nodejs-playwright-3.0`` and above, only supports ``visualReferences``. ``visualReference`` field is not supported.

           

          Versions older than ``syn-nodejs-puppeteer-11.0`` supports both ``visualReference`` and ``visualReferences`` for backward compatibility. It is recommended to use ``visualReferences`` for consistency and future compatibility.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            If this canary performs visual monitoring by comparing screenshots, this structure contains the ID of the canary run that is used as the baseline for screenshots, and the coordinates of any parts of those screenshots that are ignored during visual monitoring comparison.

             

            Visual monitoring is supported only on canaries running the **syn-puppeteer-node-3.2** runtime or later.

            
            

            - **BaseScreenshots** *(list) --* 

              An array of screenshots that are used as the baseline for comparisons during visual monitoring.

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                A structure representing a screenshot that is used as a baseline during visual monitoring comparisons made by the canary.

                
                

                - **ScreenshotName** *(string) --* 

                  The name of the screenshot. This is generated the first time the canary is run after the ``UpdateCanary`` operation that specified for this canary to perform visual monitoring.

                  
                

                - **IgnoreCoordinates** *(list) --* 

                  Coordinates that define the part of a screen to ignore during screenshot comparisons. To obtain the coordinates to use here, use the CloudWatch console to draw the boundaries on the screen.
