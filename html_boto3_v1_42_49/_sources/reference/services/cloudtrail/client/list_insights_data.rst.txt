******************



.. py:method:: CloudTrail.Client.list_insights_data(**kwargs)

  

  Returns Insights events generated on a trail that logs data events. You can list Insights events that occurred in a Region within the last 90 days.

   

  ListInsightsData supports the following Dimensions for Insights events:

   

  
  * Event ID
   
  * Event name
   
  * Event source
  

   

  All dimensions are optional. The default number of results returned is 50, with a maximum of 50 possible. The response includes a token that you can use to get the next page of results.

   

  The rate of ListInsightsData requests is limited to two per second, per account, per Region. If this limit is exceeded, a throttling error occurs.

        NextToken='string'
    )
    
  :type InsightSource: string
  :param InsightSource: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The Amazon Resource Name(ARN) of the trail for which you want to retrieve Insights events.

    

  
  :type DataType: string
  :param DataType: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies the category of events returned. To fetch Insights events, specify ``InsightsEvents`` as the value of ``DataType``

    

  
  :type Dimensions: dict
  :param Dimensions: 

    Contains a map of dimensions. Currently the map can contain only one item.

  :type StartTime: datetime
  :param StartTime: 

    Specifies that only events that occur after or at the specified time are returned. If the specified start time is after the specified end time, an error is returned.

    

  
  :type EndTime: datetime
  :param EndTime: 

    Specifies that only events that occur before or at the specified time are returned. If the specified end time is before the specified start time, an error is returned.

    

  
  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    The number of events to return. Possible values are 1 through 50. The default is 50.

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    The token to use to get the next page of results after a previous API call. This token must be passed in with the same parameters that were specified in the original call. For example, if the original call specified a EventName as a dimension with ``PutObject`` as a value, the call with NextToken should include those same parameters.

Some examples of resource types are: **Instance** for EC2, **Trail** for CloudTrail, **DBInstance** for Amazon RDS, and **AccessKey** for IAM. To learn more about how to look up and filter events by the resource types supported for a service, see `Filtering CloudTrail Events <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/view-cloudtrail-events-console.html#filtering-cloudtrail-events>`__.
