.. py:method:: CloudTrail.Client.update_event_data_store(**kwargs)

  

  Updates an event data store. The required ``EventDataStore`` value is an ARN or the ID portion of the ARN. Other parameters are optional, but at least one optional parameter must be specified, or CloudTrail throws an error. ``RetentionPeriod`` is in days, and valid values are integers between 7 and 3653 if the ``BillingMode`` is set to ``EXTENDABLE_RETENTION_PRICING``, or between 7 and 2557 if ``BillingMode`` is set to ``FIXED_RETENTION_PRICING``. By default, ``TerminationProtection`` is enabled.

   

  For event data stores for CloudTrail events, ``AdvancedEventSelectors`` includes or excludes management, data, or network activity events in your event data store. For more information about ``AdvancedEventSelectors``, see `AdvancedEventSelectors <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/APIReference/API_AdvancedEventSelector.html>`__.

   

  For event data stores for CloudTrail Insights events, Config configuration items, Audit Manager evidence, or non-Amazon Web Services events, ``AdvancedEventSelectors`` includes events of that type in your event data store.

  :type EventDataStore: string
  :param EventDataStore: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ARN (or the ID suffix of the ARN) of the event data store that you want to update.

    

  
  :type Name: string
  :param Name: 

    The event data store name.

    

  
  :type AdvancedEventSelectors: list
  :param AdvancedEventSelectors: 

    The advanced event selectors used to select events for the event data store. You can configure up to five advanced event selectors for each event data store.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      Advanced event selectors let you create fine-grained selectors for CloudTrail management, data, and network activity events. They help you control costs by logging only those events that are important to you. For more information about configuring advanced event selectors, see the `Logging data events <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-data-events-with-cloudtrail.html>`__, `Logging network activity events <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-network-events-with-cloudtrail.html>`__, and `Logging management events <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-management-events-with-cloudtrail.html>`__ topics in the *CloudTrail User Guide*.

       

      You cannot apply both event selectors and advanced event selectors to a trail.

       

      For information about configurable advanced event selector fields, see `AdvancedEventSelector <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/APIReference/API_AdvancedEventSelector.html>`__ in the *CloudTrail API Reference*.

      

    
      - **Name** *(string) --* 

        An optional, descriptive name for an advanced event selector, such as "Log data events for only two S3 buckets".

        

      
      - **FieldSelectors** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        Contains all selector statements in an advanced event selector.

        

      
        - *(dict) --* 

          A single selector statement in an advanced event selector.

          

        
          - **Field** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            A field in a CloudTrail event record on which to filter events to be logged. For event data stores for CloudTrail Insights events, Config configuration items, Audit Manager evidence, or events outside of Amazon Web Services, the field is used only for selecting events as filtering is not supported.

             

            For more information, see `AdvancedFieldSelector <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/APIReference/API_AdvancedFieldSelector.html>`__ in the *CloudTrail API Reference*.

             

            .. note::

              

              Selectors don't support the use of wildcards like ``*`` . To match multiple values with a single condition, you may use ``StartsWith``, ``EndsWith``, ``NotStartsWith``, or ``NotEndsWith`` to explicitly match the beginning or end of the event field.

              

            

          
          - **Equals** *(list) --* 

            An operator that includes events that match the exact value of the event record field specified as the value of ``Field``. This is the only valid operator that you can use with the ``readOnly``, ``eventCategory``, and ``resources.type`` fields.

            

          
            - *(string) --* 

            
        
          - **StartsWith** *(list) --* 

            An operator that includes events that match the first few characters of the event record field specified as the value of ``Field``.

            

          
            - *(string) --* 

            
        
          - **EndsWith** *(list) --* 

            An operator that includes events that match the last few characters of the event record field specified as the value of ``Field``.

            

          
            - *(string) --* 

            
        
          - **NotEquals** *(list) --* 

            An operator that excludes events that match the exact value of the event record field specified as the value of ``Field``.

            

          
            - *(string) --* 

            
        
          - **NotStartsWith** *(list) --* 

            An operator that excludes events that match the first few characters of the event record field specified as the value of ``Field``.

            

          
            - *(string) --* 

            
        
          - **NotEndsWith** *(list) --* 

            An operator that excludes events that match the last few characters of the event record field specified as the value of ``Field``.

            

          
            - *(string) --* 

            
        
        
    
    

  :type MultiRegionEnabled: boolean
  :param MultiRegionEnabled: 

    Specifies whether an event data store collects events from all Regions, or only from the Region in which it was created.

    

  
  :type OrganizationEnabled: boolean
  :param OrganizationEnabled: 

    Specifies whether an event data store collects events logged for an organization in Organizations.

     

    .. note::

      

      Only the management account for the organization can convert an organization event data store to a non-organization event data store, or convert a non-organization event data store to an organization event data store.

      

    

  
  :type RetentionPeriod: integer
  :param RetentionPeriod: 

    The retention period of the event data store, in days. If ``BillingMode`` is set to ``EXTENDABLE_RETENTION_PRICING``, you can set a retention period of up to 3653 days, the equivalent of 10 years. If ``BillingMode`` is set to ``FIXED_RETENTION_PRICING``, you can set a retention period of up to 2557 days, the equivalent of seven years.

     

    CloudTrail Lake determines whether to retain an event by checking if the ``eventTime`` of the event is within the specified retention period. For example, if you set a retention period of 90 days, CloudTrail will remove events when the ``eventTime`` is older than 90 days.

     

    .. note::

      

      If you decrease the retention period of an event data store, CloudTrail will remove any events with an ``eventTime`` older than the new retention period. For example, if the previous retention period was 365 days and you decrease it to 100 days, CloudTrail will remove events with an ``eventTime`` older than 100 days.

      

    

  
  :type TerminationProtectionEnabled: boolean
  :param TerminationProtectionEnabled: 

    Indicates that termination protection is enabled and the event data store cannot be automatically deleted.

    

  
  :type KmsKeyId: string
  :param KmsKeyId: 

    Specifies the KMS key ID to use to encrypt the events delivered by CloudTrail. The value can be an alias name prefixed by ``alias/``, a fully specified ARN to an alias, a fully specified ARN to a key, or a globally unique identifier.

     

    .. warning::

       

      Disabling or deleting the KMS key, or removing CloudTrail permissions on the key, prevents CloudTrail from logging events to the event data store, and prevents users from querying the data in the event data store that was encrypted with the key. After you associate an event data store with a KMS key, the KMS key cannot be removed or changed. Before you disable or delete a KMS key that you are using with an event data store, delete or back up your event data store.

       

     

    CloudTrail also supports KMS multi-Region keys. For more information about multi-Region keys, see `Using multi-Region keys <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html>`__ in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

     

    Examples:

     

    
    * ``alias/MyAliasName``
     
    * ``arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:alias/MyAliasName``
     
    * ``arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:key/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012``
     
    * ``12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012``
    

    

  
  :type BillingMode: string
  :param BillingMode: 

    .. note::

      

      You can't change the billing mode from ``EXTENDABLE_RETENTION_PRICING`` to ``FIXED_RETENTION_PRICING``. If ``BillingMode`` is set to ``EXTENDABLE_RETENTION_PRICING`` and you want to use ``FIXED_RETENTION_PRICING`` instead, you'll need to stop ingestion on the event data store and create a new event data store that uses ``FIXED_RETENTION_PRICING``.

      

     

    The billing mode for the event data store determines the cost for ingesting events and the default and maximum retention period for the event data store.

     

    The following are the possible values:

     

    
    * ``EXTENDABLE_RETENTION_PRICING`` - This billing mode is generally recommended if you want a flexible retention period of up to 3653 days (about 10 years). The default retention period for this billing mode is 366 days.
     
    * ``FIXED_RETENTION_PRICING`` - This billing mode is recommended if you expect to ingest more than 25 TB of event data per month and need a retention period of up to 2557 days (about 7 years). The default retention period for this billing mode is 2557 days.
