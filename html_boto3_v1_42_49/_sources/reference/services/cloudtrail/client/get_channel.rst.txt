    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **ChannelArn** *(string) --* 

        The ARN of an channel returned by a ``GetChannel`` request.

        
      

      - **Name** *(string) --* 

        The name of the CloudTrail channel. For service-linked channels, the name is ``aws-service-channel/service-name/custom-suffix`` where ``service-name`` represents the name of the Amazon Web Services service that created the channel and ``custom-suffix`` represents the suffix generated by the Amazon Web Services service.

        
      

      - **Source** *(string) --* 

        The source for the CloudTrail channel.

        
      

      - **SourceConfig** *(dict) --* 

        Provides information about the advanced event selectors configured for the channel, and whether the channel applies to all Regions or a single Region.

        
        

        - **ApplyToAllRegions** *(boolean) --* 

          Specifies whether the channel applies to a single Region or to all Regions.

          
        

        - **AdvancedEventSelectors** *(list) --* 

          The advanced event selectors that are configured for the channel.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            Advanced event selectors let you create fine-grained selectors for CloudTrail management, data, and network activity events. They help you control costs by logging only those events that are important to you. For more information about configuring advanced event selectors, see the `Logging data events <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-data-events-with-cloudtrail.html>`__, `Logging network activity events <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-network-events-with-cloudtrail.html>`__, and `Logging management events <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-management-events-with-cloudtrail.html>`__ topics in the *CloudTrail User Guide*.

             

            You cannot apply both event selectors and advanced event selectors to a trail.

             

            For information about configurable advanced event selector fields, see `AdvancedEventSelector <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/APIReference/API_AdvancedEventSelector.html>`__ in the *CloudTrail API Reference*.

            
            

            - **Name** *(string) --* 

              An optional, descriptive name for an advanced event selector, such as "Log data events for only two S3 buckets".

              
            

            - **FieldSelectors** *(list) --* 

              Contains all selector statements in an advanced event selector.

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                A single selector statement in an advanced event selector.

                
                

                - **Field** *(string) --* 

                  A field in a CloudTrail event record on which to filter events to be logged. For event data stores for CloudTrail Insights events, Config configuration items, Audit Manager evidence, or events outside of Amazon Web Services, the field is used only for selecting events as filtering is not supported.

                   

                  For more information, see `AdvancedFieldSelector <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/APIReference/API_AdvancedFieldSelector.html>`__ in the *CloudTrail API Reference*.

                   

                  .. note::

                    

                    Selectors don't support the use of wildcards like ``*`` . To match multiple values with a single condition, you may use ``StartsWith``, ``EndsWith``, ``NotStartsWith``, or ``NotEndsWith`` to explicitly match the beginning or end of the event field.

                  An operator that includes events that match the exact value of the event record field specified as the value of ``Field``. This is the only valid operator that you can use with the ``readOnly``, ``eventCategory``, and ``resources.type`` fields.

                  
                  

                  - *(string) --* 
              
                

                - **StartsWith** *(list) --* 

                  An operator that includes events that match the first few characters of the event record field specified as the value of ``Field``.

                  
                  

                  - *(string) --*

                  An operator that includes events that match the last few characters of the event record field specified as the value of ``Field``.

                  
                  

                  - *(string) --*
