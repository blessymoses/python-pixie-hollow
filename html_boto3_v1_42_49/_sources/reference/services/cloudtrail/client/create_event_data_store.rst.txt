  :type AdvancedEventSelectors: list
  :param AdvancedEventSelectors: 

    The advanced event selectors to use to select the events for the data store. You can configure up to five advanced event selectors for each event data store.

     

    For more information about how to use advanced event selectors to log CloudTrail events, see `Log events by using advanced event selectors <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-data-events-with-cloudtrail.html#creating-data-event-selectors-advanced>`__ in the CloudTrail User Guide.

     

    For more information about how to use advanced event selectors to include Config configuration items in your event data store, see `Create an event data store for Config configuration items <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/lake-eds-cli.html#lake-cli-create-eds-config>`__ in the CloudTrail User Guide.

     

    For more information about how to use advanced event selectors to include events outside of Amazon Web Services events in your event data store, see `Create an integration to log events from outside Amazon Web Services <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/lake-integrations-cli.html#lake-cli-create-integration>`__ in the CloudTrail User Guide.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      Advanced event selectors let you create fine-grained selectors for CloudTrail management, data, and network activity events. They help you control costs by logging only those events that are important to you. For more information about configuring advanced event selectors, see the `Logging data events <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-data-events-with-cloudtrail.html>`__, `Logging network activity events <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-network-events-with-cloudtrail.html>`__, and `Logging management events <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-management-events-with-cloudtrail.html>`__ topics in the *CloudTrail User Guide*.

       

      You cannot apply both event selectors and advanced event selectors to a trail.

       

      For information about configurable advanced event selector fields, see `AdvancedEventSelector <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/APIReference/API_AdvancedEventSelector.html>`__ in the *CloudTrail API Reference*.

      

    
      - **Name** *(string) --* 

        An optional, descriptive name for an advanced event selector, such as "Log data events for only two S3 buckets".

        

      
      - **FieldSelectors** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        Contains all selector statements in an advanced event selector.

        

      
        - *(dict) --* 

          A single selector statement in an advanced event selector.

          

        
          - **Field** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            A field in a CloudTrail event record on which to filter events to be logged. For event data stores for CloudTrail Insights events, Config configuration items, Audit Manager evidence, or events outside of Amazon Web Services, the field is used only for selecting events as filtering is not supported.

             

            For more information, see `AdvancedFieldSelector <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/APIReference/API_AdvancedFieldSelector.html>`__ in the *CloudTrail API Reference*.

             

            .. note::

              

              Selectors don't support the use of wildcards like ``*`` . To match multiple values with a single condition, you may use ``StartsWith``, ``EndsWith``, ``NotStartsWith``, or ``NotEndsWith`` to explicitly match the beginning or end of the event field.

              

            

          
          - **Equals** *(list) --* 

            An operator that includes events that match the exact value of the event record field specified as the value of ``Field``. This is the only valid operator that you can use with the ``readOnly``, ``eventCategory``, and ``resources.type`` fields.

            

          
            - *(string) --* 

            
        
          - **StartsWith** *(list) --* 

            An operator that includes events that match the first few characters of the event record field specified as the value of ``Field``.

            

          
            - *(string) --* 

            
        
          - **EndsWith** *(list) --* 

            An operator that includes events that match the last few characters of the event record field specified as the value of ``Field``.

            

          
            - *(string) --* 

            
        
          - **NotEquals** *(list) --* 

            An operator that excludes events that match the exact value of the event record field specified as the value of ``Field``.

            

          
            - *(string) --* 

            
        
          - **NotStartsWith** *(list) --* 

            An operator that excludes events that match the first few characters of the event record field specified as the value of ``Field``.

            

          
            - *(string) --* 

            
        
          - **NotEndsWith** *(list) --* 

            An operator that excludes events that match the last few characters of the event record field specified as the value of ``Field``.

            

          
            - *(string) --* 

            
        
        
    
    

  :type MultiRegionEnabled: boolean
  :param MultiRegionEnabled: 

    Specifies whether the event data store includes events from all Regions, or only from the Region in which the event data store is created.

    

  
  :type OrganizationEnabled: boolean
  :param OrganizationEnabled: 

    Specifies whether an event data store collects events logged for an organization in Organizations.

    

  
  :type RetentionPeriod: integer
  :param RetentionPeriod: 

    The retention period of the event data store, in days. If ``BillingMode`` is set to ``EXTENDABLE_RETENTION_PRICING``, you can set a retention period of up to 3653 days, the equivalent of 10 years. If ``BillingMode`` is set to ``FIXED_RETENTION_PRICING``, you can set a retention period of up to 2557 days, the equivalent of seven years.

     

    CloudTrail Lake determines whether to retain an event by checking if the ``eventTime`` of the event is within the specified retention period. For example, if you set a retention period of 90 days, CloudTrail will remove events when the ``eventTime`` is older than 90 days.

     

    .. note::

      

      If you plan to copy trail events to this event data store, we recommend that you consider both the age of the events that you want to copy as well as how long you want to keep the copied events in your event data store. For example, if you copy trail events that are 5 years old and specify a retention period of 7 years, the event data store will retain those events for two years.

      

    

  
  :type TerminationProtectionEnabled: boolean
  :param TerminationProtectionEnabled: 

    Specifies whether termination protection is enabled for the event data store. If termination protection is enabled, you cannot delete the event data store until termination protection is disabled.

    

  
  :type TagsList: list
  :param TagsList: 

    A list of tags.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      A custom key-value pair associated with a resource such as a CloudTrail trail, event data store, dashboard, or channel.

      

    
      - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The key in a key-value pair. The key must be must be no longer than 128 Unicode characters. The key must be unique for the resource to which it applies.

        

      
      - **Value** *(string) --* 

        The value in a key-value pair of a tag. The value must be no longer than 256 Unicode characters.

        

      
    

  :type KmsKeyId: string
  :param KmsKeyId: 

    Specifies the KMS key ID to use to encrypt the events delivered by CloudTrail. The value can be an alias name prefixed by ``alias/``, a fully specified ARN to an alias, a fully specified ARN to a key, or a globally unique identifier.

     

    .. warning::

       

      Disabling or deleting the KMS key, or removing CloudTrail permissions on the key, prevents CloudTrail from logging events to the event data store, and prevents users from querying the data in the event data store that was encrypted with the key. After you associate an event data store with a KMS key, the KMS key cannot be removed or changed. Before you disable or delete a KMS key that you are using with an event data store, delete or back up your event data store.

       

     

    CloudTrail also supports KMS multi-Region keys. For more information about multi-Region keys, see `Using multi-Region keys <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html>`__ in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

     

    Examples:

     

    
    * ``alias/MyAliasName``
     
    * ``arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:alias/MyAliasName``
     
    * ``arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:key/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012``
     
    * ``12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012``
    

    

  
  :type StartIngestion: boolean
  :param StartIngestion: 

    Specifies whether the event data store should start ingesting live events. The default is true.

    

  
  :type BillingMode: string
  :param BillingMode: 

    The billing mode for the event data store determines the cost for ingesting events and the default and maximum retention period for the event data store.

     

    The following are the possible values:

     

    
    * ``EXTENDABLE_RETENTION_PRICING`` - This billing mode is generally recommended if you want a flexible retention period of up to 3653 days (about 10 years). The default retention period for this billing mode is 366 days.
     
    * ``FIXED_RETENTION_PRICING`` - This billing mode is recommended if you expect to ingest more than 25 TB of event data per month and need a retention period of up to 2557 days (about 7 years). The default retention period for this billing mode is 2557 days.
    

     

    The default value is ``EXTENDABLE_RETENTION_PRICING``.
