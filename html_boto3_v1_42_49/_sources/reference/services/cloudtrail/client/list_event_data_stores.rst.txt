    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **EventDataStores** *(list) --* 

        Contains information about event data stores in the account, in the current Region.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          A storage lake of event data against which you can run complex SQL-based queries. An event data store can include events that you have logged on your account. To select events for an event data store, use `advanced event selectors <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-lake-concepts.html#adv-event-selectors>`__.

          
          

          - **EventDataStoreArn** *(string) --* 

            The ARN of the event data store.

            
          

          - **Name** *(string) --* 

            The name of the event data store.

            
          

          - **TerminationProtectionEnabled** *(boolean) --* 

            Indicates whether the event data store is protected from termination.

            
          

          - **Status** *(string) --* 

            The status of an event data store.

            
          

          - **AdvancedEventSelectors** *(list) --* 

            The advanced event selectors that were used to select events for the data store.

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

              Advanced event selectors let you create fine-grained selectors for CloudTrail management, data, and network activity events. They help you control costs by logging only those events that are important to you. For more information about configuring advanced event selectors, see the `Logging data events <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-data-events-with-cloudtrail.html>`__, `Logging network activity events <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-network-events-with-cloudtrail.html>`__, and `Logging management events <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-management-events-with-cloudtrail.html>`__ topics in the *CloudTrail User Guide*.

               

              You cannot apply both event selectors and advanced event selectors to a trail.

               

              For information about configurable advanced event selector fields, see `AdvancedEventSelector <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/APIReference/API_AdvancedEventSelector.html>`__ in the *CloudTrail API Reference*.

              
              

              - **Name** *(string) --* 

                An optional, descriptive name for an advanced event selector, such as "Log data events for only two S3 buckets".

                
              

              - **FieldSelectors** *(list) --* 

                Contains all selector statements in an advanced event selector.

                
                

                - *(dict) --* 

                  A single selector statement in an advanced event selector.

                  
                  

                  - **Field** *(string) --* 

                    A field in a CloudTrail event record on which to filter events to be logged. For event data stores for CloudTrail Insights events, Config configuration items, Audit Manager evidence, or events outside of Amazon Web Services, the field is used only for selecting events as filtering is not supported.

                     

                    For more information, see `AdvancedFieldSelector <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/APIReference/API_AdvancedFieldSelector.html>`__ in the *CloudTrail API Reference*.

                     

                    .. note::

                      

                      Selectors don't support the use of wildcards like ``*`` . To match multiple values with a single condition, you may use ``StartsWith``, ``EndsWith``, ``NotStartsWith``, or ``NotEndsWith`` to explicitly match the beginning or end of the event field.

                      

                    
                  

                  - **Equals** *(list) --* 

                    An operator that includes events that match the exact value of the event record field specified as the value of ``Field``. This is the only valid operator that you can use with the ``readOnly``, ``eventCategory``, and ``resources.type`` fields.

                    
                    

                    - *(string) --* 
                
                  

                  - **StartsWith** *(list) --* 

                    An operator that includes events that match the first few characters of the event record field specified as the value of ``Field``.

                    
                    

                    - *(string) --* 
                
                  

                  - **EndsWith** *(list) --* 

                    An operator that includes events that match the last few characters of the event record field specified as the value of ``Field``.

                    
                    

                    - *(string) --* 
                
                  

                  - **NotEquals** *(list) --* 

                    An operator that excludes events that match the exact value of the event record field specified as the value of ``Field``.

                    
                    

                    - *(string) --* 
                
                  

                  - **NotStartsWith** *(list) --* 

                    An operator that excludes events that match the first few characters of the event record field specified as the value of ``Field``.

                    
                    

                    - *(string) --* 
                
                  

                  - **NotEndsWith** *(list) --* 

                    An operator that excludes events that match the last few characters of the event record field specified as the value of ``Field``.

                    
                    

                    - *(string) --* 
                
              
            
          
        
          

          - **MultiRegionEnabled** *(boolean) --* 

            Indicates whether the event data store includes events from all Regions, or only from the Region in which it was created.

            
          

          - **OrganizationEnabled** *(boolean) --* 

            Indicates that an event data store is collecting logged events for an organization.

            The retention period, in days.

            
          

          - **CreatedTimestamp** *(datetime) --* 

            The timestamp of the event data store's creation.

            
          

          - **UpdatedTimestamp** *(datetime) --* 

            The timestamp showing when an event data store was updated, if applicable. ``UpdatedTimestamp`` is always either the same or newer than the time shown in ``CreatedTimestamp``.

            
      
    
      

      - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

        A token you can use to get the next page of results.
