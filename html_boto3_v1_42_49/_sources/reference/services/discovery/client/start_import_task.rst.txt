.. py:method:: ApplicationDiscoveryService.Client.start_import_task(**kwargs)

  

  Starts an import task, which allows you to import details of your on-premises environment directly into Amazon Web Services Migration Hub without having to use the Amazon Web Services Application Discovery Service (Application Discovery Service) tools such as the Amazon Web Services Application Discovery Service Agentless Collector or Application Discovery Agent. This gives you the option to perform migration assessment and planning directly from your imported data, including the ability to group your devices as applications and track their migration status.

   

  To start an import request, do this:

   

   
  * Download the specially formatted comma separated value (CSV) import template, which you can find here: `https\://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/templates-7cffcf56-bd96-4b1c-b45b-a5b42f282e46/import_template.csv <https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/templates-7cffcf56-bd96-4b1c-b45b-a5b42f282e46/import_template.csv>`__.
   
  * Fill out the template with your server and application data.
   
  * Upload your import file to an Amazon S3 bucket, and make a note of it's Object URL. Your import file must be in the CSV format.
   
  * Use the console or the ``StartImportTask`` command with the Amazon Web Services CLI or one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to import the records from your file.
   

   

  For more information, including step-by-step procedures, see `Migration Hub Import <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/latest/userguide/discovery-import.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services Application Discovery Service User Guide*.

   

  .. note::

    

    There are limits to the number of import tasks you can create (and delete) in an Amazon Web Services account. For more information, see `Amazon Web Services Application Discovery Service Limits <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/latest/userguide/ads_service_limits.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services Application Discovery Service User Guide*.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.start_import_task(
        clientRequestToken='string',
        name='string',
        importUrl='string'
    )
    
  :type clientRequestToken: string
  :param clientRequestToken: 

    Optional. A unique token that you can provide to prevent the same import request from occurring more than once. If you don't provide a token, a token is automatically generated.

     

    Sending more than one ``StartImportTask`` request with the same client request token will return information about the original import task with that client request token.

    This field is autopopulated if not provided.

  
  :type name: string
  :param name: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A descriptive name for this request. You can use this name to filter future requests related to this import task, such as identifying applications and servers that were included in this import task. We recommend that you use a meaningful name for each import task.

    

  
  :type importUrl: string
  :param importUrl: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The URL for your import file that you've uploaded to Amazon S3.

     

    .. note::

      

      If you're using the Amazon Web Services CLI, this URL is structured as follows: ``s3://BucketName/ImportFileName.CSV``

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **task** *(dict) --* 

        An array of information related to the import task request including status information, times, IDs, the Amazon S3 Object URL for the import file, and more.

        
        

        - **importTaskId** *(string) --* 

          The unique ID for a specific import task. These IDs aren't globally unique, but they are unique within an Amazon Web Services account.

          
        

        - **clientRequestToken** *(string) --* 

          A unique token used to prevent the same import request from occurring more than once. If you didn't provide a token, a token was automatically generated when the import task request was sent.

          
        

        - **name** *(string) --* 

          A descriptive name for an import task. You can use this name to filter future requests related to this import task, such as identifying applications and servers that were included in this import task. We recommend that you use a meaningful name for each import task.

          
        

        - **importUrl** *(string) --* 

          The URL for your import file that you've uploaded to Amazon S3.

          
        

        - **status** *(string) --* 

          The status of the import task. An import can have the status of ``IMPORT_COMPLETE`` and still have some records fail to import from the overall request. More information can be found in the downloadable archive defined in the ``errorsAndFailedEntriesZip`` field, or in the Migration Hub management console.

          
        

        - **importRequestTime** *(datetime) --* 

          The time that the import task request was made, presented in the Unix time stamp format.

          
        

        - **importCompletionTime** *(datetime) --* 

          The time that the import task request finished, presented in the Unix time stamp format.

          
        

        - **importDeletedTime** *(datetime) --* 

          The time that the import task request was deleted, presented in the Unix time stamp format.

          
        

        - **fileClassification** *(string) --* 

          The type of file detected by the import task.

          
        

        - **serverImportSuccess** *(integer) --* 

          The total number of server records in the import file that were successfully imported.

          
        

        - **serverImportFailure** *(integer) --* 

          The total number of server records in the import file that failed to be imported.

          
        

        - **applicationImportSuccess** *(integer) --* 

          The total number of application records in the import file that were successfully imported.

          
        

        - **applicationImportFailure** *(integer) --* 

          The total number of application records in the import file that failed to be imported.

          
        

        - **errorsAndFailedEntriesZip** *(string) --* 

          A link to a compressed archive folder (in the ZIP format) that contains an error log and a file of failed records. You can use these two files to quickly identify records that failed, why they failed, and correct those records. Afterward, you can upload the corrected file to your Amazon S3 bucket and create another import task request.

           

          This field also includes authorization information so you can confirm the authenticity of the compressed archive before you download it.

           

          If some records failed to be imported we recommend that you correct the records in the failed entries file and then imports that failed entries file. This prevents you from having to correct and update the larger original file and attempt importing it again.
