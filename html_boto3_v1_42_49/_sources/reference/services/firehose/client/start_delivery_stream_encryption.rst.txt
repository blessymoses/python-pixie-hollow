.. py:method:: Firehose.Client.start_delivery_stream_encryption(**kwargs)

  

  Enables server-side encryption (SSE) for the Firehose stream.

   

  This operation is asynchronous. It returns immediately. When you invoke it, Firehose first sets the encryption status of the stream to ``ENABLING``, and then to ``ENABLED``. The encryption status of a Firehose stream is the ``Status`` property in  DeliveryStreamEncryptionConfiguration. If the operation fails, the encryption status changes to ``ENABLING_FAILED``. You can continue to read and write data to your Firehose stream while the encryption status is ``ENABLING``, but the data is not encrypted. It can take up to 5 seconds after the encryption status changes to ``ENABLED`` before all records written to the Firehose stream are encrypted. To find out whether a record or a batch of records was encrypted, check the response elements  PutRecordOutput$Encrypted and  PutRecordBatchOutput$Encrypted, respectively.

   

  To check the encryption status of a Firehose stream, use  DescribeDeliveryStream.

   

  Even if encryption is currently enabled for a Firehose stream, you can still invoke this operation on it to change the ARN of the CMK or both its type and ARN. If you invoke this method to change the CMK, and the old CMK is of type ``CUSTOMER_MANAGED_CMK``, Firehose schedules the grant it had on the old CMK for retirement. If the new CMK is of type ``CUSTOMER_MANAGED_CMK``, Firehose creates a grant that enables it to use the new CMK to encrypt and decrypt data and to manage the grant.

   

  For the KMS grant creation to be successful, the Firehose API operations ``StartDeliveryStreamEncryption`` and ``CreateDeliveryStream`` should not be called with session credentials that are more than 6 hours old.

   

  If a Firehose stream already has encryption enabled and then you invoke this operation to change the ARN of the CMK or both its type and ARN and you get ``ENABLING_FAILED``, this only means that the attempt to change the CMK failed. In this case, encryption remains enabled with the old CMK.

   

  If the encryption status of your Firehose stream is ``ENABLING_FAILED``, you can invoke this operation again with a valid CMK. The CMK must be enabled and the key policy mustn't explicitly deny the permission for Firehose to invoke KMS encrypt and decrypt operations.

   

  You can enable SSE for a Firehose stream only if it's a Firehose stream that uses ``DirectPut`` as its source.

   

  The ``StartDeliveryStreamEncryption`` and ``StopDeliveryStreamEncryption`` operations have a combined limit of 25 calls per Firehose stream per 24 hours. For example, you reach the limit if you call ``StartDeliveryStreamEncryption`` 13 times and ``StopDeliveryStreamEncryption`` 12 times for the same Firehose stream in a 24-hour period.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.start_delivery_stream_encryption(
        DeliveryStreamName='string',
        DeliveryStreamEncryptionConfigurationInput={
            'KeyARN': 'string',
            'KeyType': 'AWS_OWNED_CMK'|'CUSTOMER_MANAGED_CMK'
        }
    )
    
  :type DeliveryStreamName: string
  :param DeliveryStreamName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of the Firehose stream for which you want to enable server-side encryption (SSE).

    

  
  :type DeliveryStreamEncryptionConfigurationInput: dict
  :param DeliveryStreamEncryptionConfigurationInput: 

    Used to specify the type and Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the KMS key needed for Server-Side Encryption (SSE).

    

  
    - **KeyARN** *(string) --* 

      If you set ``KeyType`` to ``CUSTOMER_MANAGED_CMK``, you must specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CMK. If you set ``KeyType`` to ``Amazon Web Services_OWNED_CMK``, Firehose uses a service-account CMK.

      

    
    - **KeyType** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      Indicates the type of customer master key (CMK) to use for encryption. The default setting is ``Amazon Web Services_OWNED_CMK``. For more information about CMKs, see `Customer Master Keys (CMKs) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#master_keys>`__. When you invoke  CreateDeliveryStream or  StartDeliveryStreamEncryption with ``KeyType`` set to CUSTOMER_MANAGED_CMK, Firehose invokes the Amazon KMS operation `CreateGrant <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_CreateGrant.html>`__ to create a grant that allows the Firehose service to use the customer managed CMK to perform encryption and decryption. Firehose manages that grant.

       

      When you invoke  StartDeliveryStreamEncryption to change the CMK for a Firehose stream that is encrypted with a customer managed CMK, Firehose schedules the grant it had on the old CMK for retirement.

       

      You can use a CMK of type CUSTOMER_MANAGED_CMK to encrypt up to 500 Firehose streams. If a  CreateDeliveryStream or  StartDeliveryStreamEncryption operation exceeds this limit, Firehose throws a ``LimitExceededException``.

       

      .. warning::

         

        To encrypt your Firehose stream, use symmetric CMKs. Firehose doesn't support asymmetric CMKs. For information about symmetric and asymmetric CMKs, see `About Symmetric and Asymmetric CMKs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symm-asymm-concepts.html>`__ in the Amazon Web Services Key Management Service developer guide.
