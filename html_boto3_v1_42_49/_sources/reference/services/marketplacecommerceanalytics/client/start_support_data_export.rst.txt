.. py:method:: MarketplaceCommerceAnalytics.Client.start_support_data_export(**kwargs)

  *This target has been deprecated.* Given a data set type and a from date, asynchronously publishes the requested customer support data to the specified S3 bucket and notifies the specified SNS topic once the data is available. Returns a unique request identifier that can be used to correlate requests with notifications from the SNS topic. Data sets will be published in comma-separated values (CSV) format with the file name {data_set_type}_YYYY-MM-DD'T'HH-mm-ss'Z'.csv. If a file with the same name already exists (e.g. if the same data set is requested twice), the original file will be overwritten by the new file. Requires a Role with an attached permissions policy providing Allow permissions for the following actions: s3:PutObject, s3:GetBucketLocation, sns:GetTopicAttributes, sns:Publish, iam:GetRolePolicy.

  .. danger::

        This operation is deprecated and may not function as expected. This operation should not be used going forward and is only kept for the purpose of backwards compatiblity.

  :type dataSetType: string
  :param dataSetType: **[REQUIRED]** 

    *This target has been deprecated.* Specifies the data set type to be written to the output csv file. The data set types customer_support_contacts_data and test_customer_support_contacts_data both result in a csv file containing the following fields: Product Id, Product Code, Customer Guid, Subscription Guid, Subscription Start Date, Organization, AWS Account Id, Given Name, Surname, Telephone Number, Email, Title, Country Code, ZIP Code, Operation Type, and Operation Time.

     

    

    
    * *customer_support_contacts_data* Customer support contact data. The data set will contain all changes (Creates, Updates, and Deletes) to customer support contact data from the date specified in the from_date parameter.
     
    * *test_customer_support_contacts_data* An example data set containing static test data in the same format as customer_support_contacts_data
    

    

    

  
  :type fromDate: datetime

If the prefix directory structure does not exist, it will be created. If no prefix is provided, the data set will be published to the S3 bucket root.

  
  :type snsTopicArn: string
  :param snsTopicArn: **[REQUIRED]** *This target has been deprecated.* Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the SNS Topic that will be notified when the data set has been published or if an error has occurred.
