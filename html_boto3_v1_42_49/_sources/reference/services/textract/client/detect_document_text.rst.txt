.. py:method:: Textract.Client.detect_document_text(**kwargs)

  

  Detects text in the input document. Amazon Textract can detect lines of text and the words that make up a line of text. The input document must be in one of the following image formats: JPEG, PNG, PDF, or TIFF. ``DetectDocumentText`` returns the detected text in an array of  Block objects.

   

  Each document page has as an associated ``Block`` of type PAGE. Each PAGE ``Block`` object is the parent of LINE ``Block`` objects that represent the lines of detected text on a page. A LINE ``Block`` object is a parent for each word that makes up the line. Words are represented by ``Block`` objects of type WORD.

   

  ``DetectDocumentText`` is a synchronous operation. To analyze documents asynchronously, use  StartDocumentTextDetection.

   

  For more information, see `Document Text Detection <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/textract/latest/dg/how-it-works-detecting.html>`__.

  :type Document: dict
  :param Document: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The input document as base64-encoded bytes or an Amazon S3 object. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Textract operations, you can't pass image bytes. The document must be an image in JPEG or PNG format.

     

    If you're using an AWS SDK to call Amazon Textract, you might not need to base64-encode image bytes that are passed using the ``Bytes`` field.

    

  
    - **Bytes** *(bytes) --* 

      A blob of base64-encoded document bytes. The maximum size of a document that's provided in a blob of bytes is 5 MB. The document bytes must be in PNG or JPEG format.

       

      If you're using an AWS SDK to call Amazon Textract, you might not need to base64-encode image bytes passed using the ``Bytes`` field.

      

    
    - **S3Object** *(dict) --* 

      Identifies an S3 object as the document source. The maximum size of a document that's stored in an S3 bucket is 5 MB.

      

    
      - **Bucket** *(string) --* 

        The name of the S3 bucket. Note that the # character is not valid in the file name.

        

      
      - **Name** *(string) --* 

        The file name of the input document. Image files may be in PDF, TIFF, JPEG, or PNG format.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **DocumentMetadata** *(dict) --* 

        Metadata about the document. It contains the number of pages that are detected in the document.

        
        

        - **Pages** *(integer) --* 

          The number of pages that are detected in the document.

          
    
      

      - **Blocks** *(list) --* 

        An array of ``Block`` objects that contain the text that's detected in the document.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          A ``Block`` represents items that are recognized in a document within a group of pixels close to each other. The information returned in a ``Block`` object depends on the type of operation. In text detection for documents (for example  DetectDocumentText), you get information about the detected words and lines of text. In text analysis (for example  AnalyzeDocument), you can also get information about the fields, tables, and selection elements that are detected in the document.

           

          An array of ``Block`` objects is returned by both synchronous and asynchronous operations. In synchronous operations, such as  DetectDocumentText, the array of ``Block`` objects is the entire set of results. In asynchronous operations, such as  GetDocumentAnalysis, the array is returned over one or more responses.

           

          For more information, see `How Amazon Textract Works <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/textract/latest/dg/how-it-works.html>`__.

          
          

          - **BlockType** *(string) --* 

            The type of text item that's recognized. In operations for text detection, the following types are returned:

             

            
            * *PAGE* - Contains a list of the LINE ``Block`` objects that are detected on a document page.
             
            * *WORD* - A word detected on a document page. A word is one or more ISO basic Latin script characters that aren't separated by spaces.
             
            * *LINE* - A string of space-delimited, contiguous words that are detected on a document page.

          - **Page** *(integer) --* 

            The page on which a block was detected. ``Page`` is returned by synchronous and asynchronous operations. Page values greater than 1 are only returned for multipage documents that are in PDF or TIFF format. A scanned image (JPEG/PNG) provided to an asynchronous operation, even if it contains multiple document pages, is considered a single-page document. This means that for scanned images the value of ``Page`` is always 1.

            - **Pages** *(list) --* 

              Pages is a parameter that the user inputs to specify which pages to apply a query to. The following is a list of rules for using this parameter.

               

              
              * If a page is not specified, it is set to ``["1"]`` by default.
               
              * The following characters are allowed in the parameter's string: ``0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 - *``. No whitespace is allowed.
               
              * When using * to indicate all pages, it must be the only element in the list.
               
              * You can use page intervals, such as ``[“1-3”, “1-1”, “4-*”]``. Where ``*`` indicates last page of document.
               
              * Specified pages must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to the number of pages in the document.
