.. py:method:: Textract.Client.analyze_document(**kwargs)

  

  Analyzes an input document for relationships between detected items.

   

  The types of information returned are as follows:

   

  
  * Form data (key-value pairs). The related information is returned in two  Block objects, each of type ``KEY_VALUE_SET``: a KEY ``Block`` object and a VALUE ``Block`` object. For example, *Name: Ana Silva Carolina* contains a key and value. *Name:* is the key. *Ana Silva Carolina* is the value.
   
  * Table and table cell data. A TABLE ``Block`` object contains information about a detected table. A CELL ``Block`` object is returned for each cell in a table.
   
  * Lines and words of text. A LINE ``Block`` object contains one or more WORD ``Block`` objects. All lines and words that are detected in the document are returned (including text that doesn't have a relationship with the value of ``FeatureTypes``).
   
  * Signatures. A SIGNATURE ``Block`` object contains the location information of a signature in a document. If used in conjunction with forms or tables, a signature can be given a Key-Value pairing or be detected in the cell of a table.
   
  * Query. A QUERY Block object contains the query text, alias and link to the associated Query results block object.
   
  * Query Result. A QUERY_RESULT Block object contains the answer to the query and an ID that connects it to the query asked. This Block also contains a confidence score.
  

   

  Selection elements such as check boxes and option buttons (radio buttons) can be detected in form data and in tables. A SELECTION_ELEMENT ``Block`` object contains information about a selection element, including the selection status.

   

  You can choose which type of analysis to perform by specifying the ``FeatureTypes`` list.

   

  The output is returned in a list of ``Block`` objects.

   

  ``AnalyzeDocument`` is a synchronous operation. To analyze documents asynchronously, use  StartDocumentAnalysis.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **DocumentMetadata** *(dict) --* 

        Metadata about the analyzed document. An example is the number of pages.

        
        

        - **Pages** *(integer) --* 

          The number of pages that are detected in the document.

          
    
      

      - **Blocks** *(list) --* 

        The items that are detected and analyzed by ``AnalyzeDocument``.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          A ``Block`` represents items that are recognized in a document within a group of pixels close to each other. The information returned in a ``Block`` object depends on the type of operation. In text detection for documents (for example  DetectDocumentText), you get information about the detected words and lines of text. In text analysis (for example  AnalyzeDocument), you can also get information about the fields, tables, and selection elements that are detected in the document.

           

          An array of ``Block`` objects is returned by both synchronous and asynchronous operations. In synchronous operations, such as  DetectDocumentText, the array of ``Block`` objects is the entire set of results. In asynchronous operations, such as  GetDocumentAnalysis, the array is returned over one or more responses.

           

          For more information, see `How Amazon Textract Works <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/textract/latest/dg/how-it-works.html>`__.

          
          

          - **BlockType** *(string) --* 

            The type of text item that's recognized. In operations for text detection, the following types are returned:

             

            
            * *PAGE* - Contains a list of the LINE ``Block`` objects that are detected on a document page.
             
            * *WORD* - A word detected on a document page. A word is one or more ISO basic Latin script characters that aren't separated by spaces.
             
            * *LINE* - A string of space-delimited, contiguous words that are detected on a document page.
            

             

            In text analysis operations, the following types are returned:

             

            
            * *PAGE* - Contains a list of child ``Block`` objects that are detected on a document page.
             
            * *KEY_VALUE_SET* - Stores the KEY and VALUE ``Block`` objects for linked text that's detected on a document page. Use the ``EntityType`` field to determine if a KEY_VALUE_SET object is a KEY ``Block`` object or a VALUE ``Block`` object.
             
            * *WORD* - A word that's detected on a document page. A word is one or more ISO basic Latin script characters that aren't separated by spaces.

            * *TABLE* - A table that's detected on a document page. A table is grid-based information with two or more rows or columns, with a cell span of one row and one column each.
             
            * *TABLE_TITLE* - The title of a table. A title is typically a line of text above or below a table, or embedded as the first row of a table.
             
            * *TABLE_FOOTER* - The footer associated with a table. A footer is typically a line or lines of text below a table or embedded as the last row of a table.
             
            * *CELL* - A cell within a detected table. The cell is the parent of the block that contains the text in the cell.
             
            * *MERGED_CELL* - A cell in a table whose content spans more than one row or column. The ``Relationships`` array for this cell contain data from individual cells.
             
            * *SELECTION_ELEMENT* - A selection element such as an option button (radio button) or a check box that's detected on a document page. Use the value of ``SelectionStatus`` to determine the status of the selection element.
             
            * *SIGNATURE* - The location and confidence score of a signature detected on a document page. Can be returned as part of a Key-Value pair or a detected cell.
             
            * *QUERY* - A question asked during the call of AnalyzeDocument. Contains an alias and an ID that attaches it to its answer.
             
            * *QUERY_RESULT* - A response to a question asked during the call of analyze document. Comes with an alias and ID for ease of locating in a response. Also contains location and confidence score.
            

             

            The following BlockTypes are only returned for Amazon Textract Layout.

             

            
            * ``LAYOUT_TITLE`` - The main title of the document.
             
            * ``LAYOUT_HEADER`` - Text located in the top margin of the document.

Page values greater than 1 are only returned for multipage documents that are in PDF or TIFF format. A scanned image (JPEG/PNG) provided to an asynchronous operation, even if it contains multiple document pages, is considered a single-page document. This means that for scanned images the value of ``Page`` is always 1.

              * When using * to indicate all pages, it must be the only element in the list.
               
              * You can use page intervals, such as ``[“1-3”, “1-1”, “4-*”]``. Where ``*`` indicates last page of document.
               
              * Specified pages must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to the number of pages in the document.
