.. py:method:: AccessAnalyzer.Client.validate_policy(**kwargs)

  

  Requests the validation of a policy and returns a list of findings. The findings help you identify issues and provide actionable recommendations to resolve the issue and enable you to author functional policies that meet security best practices.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.validate_policy(
        locale='DE'|'EN'|'ES'|'FR'|'IT'|'JA'|'KO'|'PT_BR'|'ZH_CN'|'ZH_TW',
        maxResults=123,
        nextToken='string',
        policyDocument='string',
        policyType='IDENTITY_POLICY'|'RESOURCE_POLICY'|'SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY'|'RESOURCE_CONTROL_POLICY',
        validatePolicyResourceType='AWS::S3::Bucket'|'AWS::S3::AccessPoint'|'AWS::S3::MultiRegionAccessPoint'|'AWS::S3ObjectLambda::AccessPoint'|'AWS::IAM::AssumeRolePolicyDocument'|'AWS::DynamoDB::Table'
    )
    
  :type locale: string
  :param locale: 

    The locale to use for localizing the findings.

    

  
  :type maxResults: integer
  :param maxResults: 

    The maximum number of results to return in the response.

    

  
  :type nextToken: string
  :param nextToken: 

    A token used for pagination of results returned.

    

  
  :type policyDocument: string
  :param policyDocument: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The JSON policy document to use as the content for the policy.

    

  
  :type policyType: string
  :param policyType: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The type of policy to validate. Identity policies grant permissions to IAM principals. Identity policies include managed and inline policies for IAM roles, users, and groups.

     

    Resource policies grant permissions on Amazon Web Services resources. Resource policies include trust policies for IAM roles and bucket policies for Amazon S3 buckets. You can provide a generic input such as identity policy or resource policy or a specific input such as managed policy or Amazon S3 bucket policy.

     

    Service control policies (SCPs) are a type of organization policy attached to an Amazon Web Services organization, organizational unit (OU), or an account.

    

  
  :type validatePolicyResourceType: string
  :param validatePolicyResourceType: 

    The type of resource to attach to your resource policy. Specify a value for the policy validation resource type only if the policy type is ``RESOURCE_POLICY``. For example, to validate a resource policy to attach to an Amazon S3 bucket, you can choose ``AWS::S3::Bucket`` for the policy validation resource type.

     

    For resource types not supported as valid values, IAM Access Analyzer runs policy checks that apply to all resource policies. For example, to validate a resource policy to attach to a KMS key, do not specify a value for the policy validation resource type and IAM Access Analyzer will run policy checks that apply to all resource policies.

        - *(dict) --* 

          A finding in a policy. Each finding is an actionable recommendation that can be used to improve the policy.

            Security warnings report when the policy allows access that we consider overly permissive.

             

            Errors report when a part of the policy is not functional.

             

            Warnings report non-security issues when a policy does not conform to policy writing best practices.

             

            Suggestions recommend stylistic improvements in the policy that do not impact access.

                  .. note::    This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the     following top level keys will be set: ``index``, ``key``, ``substring``, ``value``.     If a client receives an unknown member it will     set ``SDK_UNKNOWN_MEMBER`` as the top level key,     which maps to the name or tag of the unknown     member. The structure of ``SDK_UNKNOWN_MEMBER`` is     as follows::
