.. py:method:: ComprehendMedical.Client.infer_icd10_cm(**kwargs)

  

  InferICD10CM detects medical conditions as entities listed in a patient record and links those entities to normalized concept identifiers in the ICD-10-CM knowledge base from the Centers for Disease Control. Amazon Comprehend Medical only detects medical entities in English language texts.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **Entities** *(list) --* 

        The medical conditions detected in the text linked to ICD-10-CM concepts. If the action is successful, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response, as well as the entities detected.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          The collection of medical entities extracted from the input text and their associated information. For each entity, the response provides the entity text, the entity category, where the entity text begins and ends, and the level of confidence that Amazon Comprehend Medical has in the detection and analysis. Attributes and traits of the entity are also returned.

          
          

          - **Id** *(integer) --* 

            The numeric identifier for the entity. This is a monotonically increasing id unique within this response rather than a global unique identifier.

            
          

          - **Text** *(string) --*

          - **EndOffset** *(integer) --*
