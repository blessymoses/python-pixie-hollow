.. py:method:: ComprehendMedical.Client.infer_rx_norm(**kwargs)

  

  InferRxNorm detects medications as entities listed in a patient record and links to the normalized concept identifiers in the RxNorm database from the National Library of Medicine. Amazon Comprehend Medical only detects medical entities in English language texts.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **Entities** *(list) --* 

        The medication entities detected in the text linked to RxNorm concepts. If the action is successful, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response, as well as the entities detected.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          The collection of medical entities extracted from the input text and their associated information. For each entity, the response provides the entity text, the entity category, where the entity text begins and ends, and the level of confidence that Amazon Comprehend Medical has in the detection and analysis. Attributes and traits of the entity are also returned.

          
          

          - **Id** *(integer) --* 

            The numeric identifier for the entity. This is a monotonically increasing id unique within this response rather than a global unique identifier.

            
          

          - **Text** *(string) --* 

            The segment of input text extracted from which the entity was detected.

            
          

          - **Category** *(string) --*

          - **EndOffset** *(integer) --* 

            The 0-based character offset in the input text that shows where the entity ends. The offset returns the UTF-8 code point in the string.

            
          

          - **Attributes** *(list) --* 

            The extracted attributes that relate to the entity. The attributes recognized by InferRxNorm are ``DOSAGE``, ``DURATION``, ``FORM``, ``FREQUENCY``, ``RATE``, ``ROUTE_OR_MODE``, and ``STRENGTH``.
