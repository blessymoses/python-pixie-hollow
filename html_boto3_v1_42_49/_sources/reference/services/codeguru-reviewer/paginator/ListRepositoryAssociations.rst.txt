          }
      )
      
    :type ProviderTypes: list
    :param ProviderTypes: 

      List of provider types to use as a filter.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type States: list
    :param States: 

      List of repository association states to use as a filter.

       

      The valid repository association states are:

       

      
      * **Associated**: The repository association is complete.
       
      * **Associating**: CodeGuru Reviewer is: 

        
        * Setting up pull request notifications. This is required for pull requests to trigger a CodeGuru Reviewer review. 

        .. note::

          If your repository ``ProviderType`` is ``GitHub``, ``GitHub Enterprise Server``, or ``Bitbucket``, CodeGuru Reviewer creates webhooks in your repository to trigger CodeGuru Reviewer reviews. If you delete these webhooks, reviews of code in your repository cannot be triggered.

        
         
        * Setting up source code access. This is required for CodeGuru Reviewer to securely clone code in your repository.
        

      
       
      * **Failed**: The repository failed to associate or disassociate.
       
      * **Disassociating**: CodeGuru Reviewer is removing the repository's pull request notifications and source code access.
       
      * **Disassociated**: CodeGuru Reviewer successfully disassociated the repository. You can create a new association with this repository if you want to review source code in it later. You can control access to code reviews created in anassociated repository with tags after it has been disassociated. For more information, see `Using tags to control access to associated repositories <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/reviewer-ug/auth-and-access-control-using-tags.html>`__ in the *Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer User Guide*.

    :type Owners: list
    :param Owners: 

      List of owners to use as a filter. For Amazon Web Services CodeCommit, it is the name of the CodeCommit account that was used to associate the repository. For other repository source providers, such as Bitbucket and GitHub Enterprise Server, this is name of the account that was used to associate the repository.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type PaginationConfig: dict

      A dictionary that provides parameters to control pagination.

      

    
      - **MaxItems** *(integer) --* 

        The total number of items to return. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified in max-items then a ``NextToken`` will be provided in the output that you can use to resume pagination.

        

      
      - **PageSize** *(integer) --* 

        The size of each page.
