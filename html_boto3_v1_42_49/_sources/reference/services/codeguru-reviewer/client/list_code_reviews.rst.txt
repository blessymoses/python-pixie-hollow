            The owner of the repository. For an Amazon Web Services CodeCommit repository, this is the Amazon Web Services account ID of the account that owns the repository. For a GitHub, GitHub Enterprise Server, or Bitbucket repository, this is the username for the account that owns the repository. For an S3 repository, it can be the username or Amazon Web Services account ID.

            
          

          - **ProviderType** *(string) --* 

            The provider type of the repository association.

            
          

          - **State** *(string) --* 

            The state of the code review.

             

            The valid code review states are:

             

            
            * ``Completed``: The code review is complete.
             
            * ``Pending``: The code review started and has not completed or failed.
             
            * ``Failed``: The code review failed.
             
            * ``Deleting``: The code review is being deleted.
            

            
          

          - **CreatedTimeStamp** *(datetime) --* 

            The time, in milliseconds since the epoch, when the code review was created.

            
          

          - **LastUpdatedTimeStamp** *(datetime) --* 

            The time, in milliseconds since the epoch, when the code review was last updated.

            
          

          - **Type** *(string) --* 

            The type of the code review.

            
          

          - **PullRequestId** *(string) --* 

            The pull request ID for the code review.

            
          

          - **MetricsSummary** *(dict) --* 

            The statistics from the code review.

            
            

            - **MeteredLinesOfCodeCount** *(integer) --* 

              Lines of code metered in the code review. For the initial code review pull request and all subsequent revisions, this includes all lines of code in the files added to the pull request. In subsequent revisions, for files that already existed in the pull request, this includes only the changed lines of code. In both cases, this does not include non-code lines such as comments and import statements. For example, if you submit a pull request containing 5 files, each with 500 lines of code, and in a subsequent revision you added a new file with 200 lines of code, and also modified a total of 25 lines across the initial 5 files, ``MeteredLinesOfCodeCount`` includes the first 5 files (5 * 500 = 2,500 lines), the new file (200 lines) and the 25 changed lines of code for a total of 2,725 lines of code.

              
            

            - **SuppressedLinesOfCodeCount** *(integer) --* 

              Lines of code suppressed in the code review based on the ``excludeFiles`` element in the ``aws-codeguru-reviewer.yml`` file. For full repository analyses, this number includes all lines of code in the files that are suppressed. For pull requests, this number only includes the *changed* lines of code that are suppressed. In both cases, this number does not include non-code lines such as comments and import statements. For example, if you initiate a full repository analysis on a repository containing 5 files, each file with 100 lines of code, and 2 files are listed as excluded in the ``aws-codeguru-reviewer.yml`` file, then ``SuppressedLinesOfCodeCount`` returns 200 (2 * 100) as the total number of lines of code suppressed. However, if you submit a pull request for the same repository, then ``SuppressedLinesOfCodeCount`` only includes the lines in the 2 files that changed. If only 1 of the 2 files changed in the pull request, then ``SuppressedLinesOfCodeCount`` returns 100 (1 * 100) as the total number of lines of code suppressed.

              
            

            - **FindingsCount** *(integer) --* 

              Total number of recommendations found in the code review.
