    :type DBInstanceIdentifier: string
    :param DBInstanceIdentifier: 

      The ID of the DB instance to retrieve the list of DB snapshots for. This parameter isn't case-sensitive.

       

      Constraints:

       

      
      * If supplied, must match the identifier of an existing DBInstance.
      

      

    
    :type DBSnapshotIdentifier: string
    :param DBSnapshotIdentifier: 

      A specific DB snapshot identifier to describe. This value is stored as a lowercase string.

       

      Constraints:

       

      
      * If supplied, must match the identifier of an existing DBSnapshot.
       
      * If this identifier is for an automated snapshot, the ``SnapshotType`` parameter must also be specified.
      

      

    
    :type SnapshotType: string
    :param SnapshotType: 

      The type of snapshots to be returned. You can specify one of the following values:

       

      
      * ``automated`` - Return all DB snapshots that have been automatically taken by Amazon RDS for my Amazon Web Services account.
       
      * ``manual`` - Return all DB snapshots that have been taken by my Amazon Web Services account.
       
      * ``shared`` - Return all manual DB snapshots that have been shared to my Amazon Web Services account.
       
      * ``public`` - Return all DB snapshots that have been marked as public.
       
      * ``awsbackup`` - Return the DB snapshots managed by the Amazon Web Services Backup service. For information about Amazon Web Services Backup, see the `Amazon Web Services Backup Developer Guide. <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/whatisbackup.html>`__ The ``awsbackup`` type does not apply to Aurora.
      

       

      If you don't specify a ``SnapshotType`` value, then both automated and manual snapshots are returned. Shared and public DB snapshots are not included in the returned results by default. You can include shared snapshots with these results by enabling the ``IncludeShared`` parameter. You can include public snapshots with these results by enabling the ``IncludePublic`` parameter.

       

      The ``IncludeShared`` and ``IncludePublic`` parameters don't apply for ``SnapshotType`` values of ``manual`` or ``automated``. The ``IncludePublic`` parameter doesn't apply when ``SnapshotType`` is set to ``shared``. The ``IncludeShared`` parameter doesn't apply when ``SnapshotType`` is set to ``public``.

      

    
    :type Filters: list
    :param Filters: 

      A filter that specifies one or more DB snapshots to describe.

       

      Supported filters:

       

      
      * ``db-instance-id`` - Accepts DB instance identifiers and DB instance Amazon Resource Names (ARNs).
       
      * ``db-snapshot-id`` - Accepts DB snapshot identifiers.
       
      * ``dbi-resource-id`` - Accepts identifiers of source DB instances.
       
      * ``snapshot-type`` - Accepts types of DB snapshots.
       
      * ``engine`` - Accepts names of database engines.
      

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more specific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be used to match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as IDs. The filters supported by a describe operation are documented with the describe operation.

         

        .. note::

          

          Currently, wildcards are not supported in filters.

          

         

        The following actions can be filtered:

         

        
        * ``DescribeDBClusterBacktracks``
         
        * ``DescribeDBClusterEndpoints``
         
        * ``DescribeDBClusters``
         
        * ``DescribeDBInstances``
         
        * ``DescribeDBRecommendations``
         
        * ``DescribeDBShardGroups``
         
        * ``DescribePendingMaintenanceActions``
        

        

      
        - **Name** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

          

        
        - **Values** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          One or more filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

          

        
          - *(string) --* 

          
      
      
  
    :type MaxRecords: integer
    :param MaxRecords: 

      The maximum number of records to include in the response. If more records exist than the specified ``MaxRecords`` value, a pagination token called a marker is included in the response so that you can retrieve the remaining results.

       

      Default: 100

       

      Constraints: Minimum 20, maximum 100.

      

    
    :type Marker: string
    :param Marker: 

      An optional pagination token provided by a previous ``DescribeDBSnapshots`` request. If this parameter is specified, the response includes only records beyond the marker, up to the value specified by ``MaxRecords``.

      

    
    :type IncludeShared: boolean
    :param IncludeShared: 

      Specifies whether to include shared manual DB cluster snapshots from other Amazon Web Services accounts that this Amazon Web Services account has been given permission to copy or restore. By default, these snapshots are not included.

       

      You can give an Amazon Web Services account permission to restore a manual DB snapshot from another Amazon Web Services account by using the ``ModifyDBSnapshotAttribute`` API action.

       

      This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

      

    
    :type IncludePublic: boolean
    :param IncludePublic: 

      Specifies whether to include manual DB cluster snapshots that are public and can be copied or restored by any Amazon Web Services account. By default, the public snapshots are not included.

       

      You can share a manual DB snapshot as public by using the  ModifyDBSnapshotAttribute API.

       

      This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

      

    
    :type DbiResourceId: string
    :param DbiResourceId: 

      A specific DB resource ID to describe.

      

    
    :type WaiterConfig: dict
    :param WaiterConfig: 

      A dictionary that provides parameters to control waiting behavior.

      

    
      - **Delay** *(integer) --* 

        The amount of time in seconds to wait between attempts. Default: 15

        

      
      - **MaxAttempts** *(integer) --* 

        The maximum number of attempts to be made. Default: 40

        

      
    
    
    :returns: None
