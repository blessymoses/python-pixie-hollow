  :type DBProxyName: string
  :param DBProxyName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The identifier of the ``DBProxy`` associated with the target group.

    - *(dict) --* 

      A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more specific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be used to match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as IDs. The filters supported by a describe operation are documented with the describe operation.

       

      .. note::

        

        Currently, wildcards are not supported in filters.

        

       

      The following actions can be filtered:

       

      
      * ``DescribeDBClusterBacktracks``
       
      * ``DescribeDBClusterEndpoints``
       
      * ``DescribeDBClusters``

      * ``DescribePendingMaintenanceActions``
      

      

    
      - **Name** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

        

      
      - **Values** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        One or more filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
    
    

  :type Marker: string
  :param Marker: 

    An optional pagination token provided by a previous request. If this parameter is specified, the response includes only records beyond the marker, up to the value specified by ``MaxRecords``.

    

  
  :type MaxRecords: integer
  :param MaxRecords: 

    The maximum number of records to include in the response. If more records exist than the specified ``MaxRecords`` value, a pagination token called a marker is included in the response so that the remaining results can be retrieved.

     

    Default: 100

     

    Constraints: Minimum 20, maximum 100.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **TargetGroups** *(list) --* 

        An arbitrary number of ``DBProxyTargetGroup`` objects, containing details of the corresponding target groups.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          Represents a set of RDS DB instances, Aurora DB clusters, or both that a proxy can connect to. Currently, each target group is associated with exactly one RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster.

           

          This data type is used as a response element in the ``DescribeDBProxyTargetGroups`` action.

          
          

          - **DBProxyName** *(string) --* 

            The identifier for the RDS proxy associated with this target group.

            
          

          - **TargetGroupName** *(string) --* 

            The identifier for the target group. This name must be unique for all target groups owned by your Amazon Web Services account in the specified Amazon Web Services Region.

            
          

          - **TargetGroupArn** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) representing the target group.

            
          

          - **IsDefault** *(boolean) --* 

            Indicates whether this target group is the first one used for connection requests by the associated proxy. Because each proxy is currently associated with a single target group, currently this setting is always ``true``.

            
          

          - **Status** *(string) --* 

            The current status of this target group. A status of ``available`` means the target group is correctly associated with a database. Other values indicate that you must wait for the target group to be ready, or take some action to resolve an issue.

            
          

          - **ConnectionPoolConfig** *(dict) --* 

            The settings that determine the size and behavior of the connection pool for the target group.

            
            

            - **MaxConnectionsPercent** *(integer) --* 

              The maximum size of the connection pool for each target in a target group. The value is expressed as a percentage of the ``max_connections`` setting for the RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster used by the target group.

              
            

            - **MaxIdleConnectionsPercent** *(integer) --* 

              Controls how actively the proxy closes idle database connections in the connection pool. The value is expressed as a percentage of the ``max_connections`` setting for the RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster used by the target group. With a high value, the proxy leaves a high percentage of idle database connections open. A low value causes the proxy to close more idle connections and return them to the database.

              
            

            - **ConnectionBorrowTimeout** *(integer) --* 

              The number of seconds for a proxy to wait for a connection to become available in the connection pool. Only applies when the proxy has opened its maximum number of connections and all connections are busy with client sessions.

              
            

            - **SessionPinningFilters** *(list) --* 

              Each item in the list represents a class of SQL operations that normally cause all later statements in a session using a proxy to be pinned to the same underlying database connection. Including an item in the list exempts that class of SQL operations from the pinning behavior. This setting is only supported for MySQL engine family databases. Currently, the only allowed value is ``EXCLUDE_VARIABLE_SETS``.

              
              

              - *(string) --* 
          
            

            - **InitQuery** *(string) --* 

              One or more SQL statements for the proxy to run when opening each new database connection. The setting is typically used with ``SET`` statements to make sure that each connection has identical settings. The query added here must be valid. For including multiple variables in a single SET statement, use a comma separator. This is an optional field.

               

              For example: ``SET variable1=value1, variable2=value2``

               

              .. warning::

                 

                Since you can access initialization query as part of target group configuration, it is not protected by authentication or cryptographic methods. Anyone with access to view or manage your proxy target group configuration can view the initialization query. You should not add sensitive data, such as passwords or long-lived encryption keys, to this option.

                

              
        
          

          - **CreatedDate** *(datetime) --* 

            The date and time when the target group was first created.

            
          

          - **UpdatedDate** *(datetime) --* 

            The date and time when the target group was last updated.

            
      
    
      

      - **Marker** *(string) --* 

        An optional pagination token provided by a previous request. If this parameter is specified, the response includes only records beyond the marker, up to the value specified by ``MaxRecords``.
