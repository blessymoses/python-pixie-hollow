        MaxRecords=123,
        Marker='string'
    )
    
  :type DBClusterIdentifier: string
  :param DBClusterIdentifier: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The DB cluster identifier of the DB cluster to be described. This parameter is stored as a lowercase string.

     

    Constraints:

     

    
    * Must contain from 1 to 63 alphanumeric characters or hyphens.
     
    * First character must be a letter.
     
    * Can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.
    

     

    Example: ``my-cluster1``

    

  
  :type BacktrackIdentifier: string
  :param BacktrackIdentifier: 

    If specified, this value is the backtrack identifier of the backtrack to be described.

     

    Constraints:

     

    
    * Must contain a valid universally unique identifier (UUID). For more information about UUIDs, see `Universally unique identifier <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier>`__.
    

     

    Example: ``123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000``

    

  
  :type Filters: list
  :param Filters: 

    A filter that specifies one or more DB clusters to describe. Supported filters include the following:

     

    
    * ``db-cluster-backtrack-id`` - Accepts backtrack identifiers. The results list includes information about only the backtracks identified by these identifiers.
     
    * ``db-cluster-backtrack-status`` - Accepts any of the following backtrack status values: 

      
      * ``applying``
       
      * ``completed``
       
      * ``failed``
       
      * ``pending``
      

     

    The results list includes information about only the backtracks identified by these values.

    
    

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more specific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be used to match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as IDs. The filters supported by a describe operation are documented with the describe operation.

       

      .. note::

        

        Currently, wildcards are not supported in filters.

        

       

      The following actions can be filtered:

       

      
      * ``DescribeDBClusterBacktracks``
       
      * ``DescribeDBClusterEndpoints``
       
      * ``DescribeDBClusters``
       
      * ``DescribeDBInstances``
       
      * ``DescribeDBRecommendations``
       
      * ``DescribeDBShardGroups``
       
      * ``DescribePendingMaintenanceActions``
      

      

    
      - **Name** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

        

      
      - **Values** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        One or more filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
    
    

  :type MaxRecords: integer
  :param MaxRecords: 

    The maximum number of records to include in the response. If more records exist than the specified ``MaxRecords`` value, a pagination token called a marker is included in the response so you can retrieve the remaining results.

     

    Default: 100

     

    Constraints: Minimum 20, maximum 100.

    

  
  :type Marker: string
  :param Marker: 

    An optional pagination token provided by a previous ``DescribeDBClusterBacktracks`` request. If this parameter is specified, the response includes only records beyond the marker, up to the value specified by ``MaxRecords``.
