.. py:method:: RDS.Client.describe_pending_maintenance_actions(**kwargs)

  

  Returns a list of resources (for example, DB instances) that have at least one pending maintenance action.

   

  This API follows an eventual consistency model. This means that the result of the ``DescribePendingMaintenanceActions`` command might not be immediately visible to all subsequent RDS commands. Keep this in mind when you use ``DescribePendingMaintenanceActions`` immediately after using a previous API command such as ``ApplyPendingMaintenanceActions``.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.describe_pending_maintenance_actions(
        ResourceIdentifier='string',
        Filters=[
            {
                'Name': 'string',
                'Values': [
                    'string',
                ]
            },
        ],
        Marker='string',
        MaxRecords=123
    )
    
  :type ResourceIdentifier: string
  :param ResourceIdentifier: 

    The ARN of a resource to return pending maintenance actions for.

    

  
  :type Filters: list
  :param Filters: 

    A filter that specifies one or more resources to return pending maintenance actions for.

     

    Supported filters:

     

    
    * ``db-cluster-id`` - Accepts DB cluster identifiers and DB cluster Amazon Resource Names (ARNs). The results list only includes pending maintenance actions for the DB clusters identified by these ARNs.
     
    * ``db-instance-id`` - Accepts DB instance identifiers and DB instance ARNs. The results list only includes pending maintenance actions for the DB instances identified by these ARNs.
    

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more specific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be used to match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as IDs. The filters supported by a describe operation are documented with the describe operation.

       

      .. note::

        

        Currently, wildcards are not supported in filters.

        

       

      The following actions can be filtered:

       

      
      * ``DescribeDBClusterBacktracks``
       
      * ``DescribeDBClusterEndpoints``
       
      * ``DescribeDBClusters``
       
      * ``DescribeDBInstances``
       
      * ``DescribeDBRecommendations``
       
      * ``DescribeDBShardGroups``
       
      * ``DescribePendingMaintenanceActions``
      

      

    
      - **Name** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

        

      
      - **Values** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        One or more filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
    
    

  :type Marker: string
  :param Marker: 

    An optional pagination token provided by a previous ``DescribePendingMaintenanceActions`` request. If this parameter is specified, the response includes only records beyond the marker, up to a number of records specified by ``MaxRecords``.

    

  
  :type MaxRecords: integer
  :param MaxRecords: 

    The maximum number of records to include in the response. If more records exist than the specified ``MaxRecords`` value, a pagination token called a marker is included in the response so that you can retrieve the remaining results.

     

    Default: 100

     

    Constraints: Minimum 20, maximum 100.

                The effective date when the pending maintenance action is applied to the resource. This date takes into account opt-in requests received from the ``ApplyPendingMaintenanceAction`` API, the ``AutoAppliedAfterDate``, and the ``ForcedApplyDate``. This value is blank if an opt-in request has not been received and nothing has been specified as ``AutoAppliedAfterDate`` or ``ForcedApplyDate``.
