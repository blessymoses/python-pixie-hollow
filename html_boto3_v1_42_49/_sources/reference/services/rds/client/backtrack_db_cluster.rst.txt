.. py:method:: RDS.Client.backtrack_db_cluster(**kwargs)

  

  Backtracks a DB cluster to a specific time, without creating a new DB cluster.

   

  For more information on backtracking, see `Backtracking an Aurora DB Cluster <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/AuroraMySQL.Managing.Backtrack.html>`__ in the *Amazon Aurora User Guide*.

   

  .. note::

    

    This action applies only to Aurora MySQL DB clusters.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.backtrack_db_cluster(
        DBClusterIdentifier='string',
        BacktrackTo=datetime(2015, 1, 1),
        Force=True|False,
        UseEarliestTimeOnPointInTimeUnavailable=True|False
    )
    
  :type DBClusterIdentifier: string
  :param DBClusterIdentifier: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The DB cluster identifier of the DB cluster to be backtracked. This parameter is stored as a lowercase string.

     

    Constraints:

     

    
    * Must contain from 1 to 63 alphanumeric characters or hyphens.
     
    * First character must be a letter.
     
    * Can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.
    

     

    Example: ``my-cluster1``

    

  
  :type BacktrackTo: datetime
  :param BacktrackTo: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The timestamp of the time to backtrack the DB cluster to, specified in ISO 8601 format. For more information about ISO 8601, see the `ISO8601 Wikipedia page. <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601>`__

     

    .. note::

      

      If the specified time isn't a consistent time for the DB cluster, Aurora automatically chooses the nearest possible consistent time for the DB cluster.

      

     

    Constraints:

     

    
    * Must contain a valid ISO 8601 timestamp.
     
    * Can't contain a timestamp set in the future.
    

     

    Example: ``2017-07-08T18:00Z``

    

  
  :type Force: boolean
  :param Force: 

    Specifies whether to force the DB cluster to backtrack when binary logging is enabled. Otherwise, an error occurs when binary logging is enabled.

    

  
  :type UseEarliestTimeOnPointInTimeUnavailable: boolean
  :param UseEarliestTimeOnPointInTimeUnavailable: 

    Specifies whether to backtrack the DB cluster to the earliest possible backtrack time when *BacktrackTo* is set to a timestamp earlier than the earliest backtrack time. When this parameter is disabled and *BacktrackTo* is set to a timestamp earlier than the earliest backtrack time, an error occurs.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 

      This data type is used as a response element in the ``DescribeDBClusterBacktracks`` action.

      
      

      - **DBClusterIdentifier** *(string) --* 

        Contains a user-supplied DB cluster identifier. This identifier is the unique key that identifies a DB cluster.

        
      

      - **BacktrackIdentifier** *(string) --* 

        Contains the backtrack identifier.

        
      

      - **BacktrackTo** *(datetime) --* 

        The timestamp of the time to which the DB cluster was backtracked.

        
      

      - **BacktrackedFrom** *(datetime) --* 

        The timestamp of the time from which the DB cluster was backtracked.

        
      

      - **BacktrackRequestCreationTime** *(datetime) --* 

        The timestamp of the time at which the backtrack was requested.

        
      

      - **Status** *(string) --* 

        The status of the backtrack. This property returns one of the following values:

         

        
        * ``applying`` - The backtrack is currently being applied to or rolled back from the DB cluster.
         
        * ``completed`` - The backtrack has successfully been applied to or rolled back from the DB cluster.
         
        * ``failed`` - An error occurred while the backtrack was applied to or rolled back from the DB cluster.
         
        * ``pending`` - The backtrack is currently pending application to or rollback from the DB cluster.
        

        
  
  **Exceptions**
  
  *   :py:class:`RDS.Client.exceptions.InvalidDBClusterStateFault`

  
  *   :py:class:`RDS.Client.exceptions.DBClusterNotFoundFault`
