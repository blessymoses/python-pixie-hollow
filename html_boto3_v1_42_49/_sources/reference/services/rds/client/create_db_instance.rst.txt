.. py:method:: RDS.Client.create_db_instance(**kwargs)

  

  Creates a new DB instance.

   

  The new DB instance can be an RDS DB instance, or it can be a DB instance in an Aurora DB cluster. For an Aurora DB cluster, you can call this operation multiple times to add more than one DB instance to the cluster.

   

  For more information about creating an RDS DB instance, see `Creating an Amazon RDS DB instance <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_CreateDBInstance.html>`__ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.

   

  For more information about creating a DB instance in an Aurora DB cluster, see `Creating an Amazon Aurora DB cluster <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.CreateInstance.html>`__ in the *Amazon Aurora User Guide*.

  :type Iops: integer
  :param Iops: 

    The amount of Provisioned IOPS (input/output operations per second) to initially allocate for the DB instance. For information about valid IOPS values, see `Amazon RDS DB instance storage <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_Storage.html>`__ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.

     

    This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora DB instances. Storage is managed by the DB cluster.

     

    Constraints:

     

    
    * For RDS for Db2, MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL - Must be a multiple between .5 and 50 of the storage amount for the DB instance.
     
    * For RDS for SQL Server - Must be a multiple between 1 and 50 of the storage amount for the DB instance.
    

    

  
  :type StorageThroughput: integer
  :param StorageThroughput: 

    The storage throughput value, in mebibyte per second (MiBps), for the DB instance.

     

    This setting applies only to the ``gp3`` storage type.

     

    This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora or RDS Custom DB instances.

    

  
  :type OptionGroupName: string
  :param OptionGroupName: 

    The option group to associate the DB instance with.

     

    Permanent options, such as the TDE option for Oracle Advanced Security TDE, can't be removed from an option group. Also, that option group can't be removed from a DB instance after it is associated with a DB instance.

     

    This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora or RDS Custom DB instances.

    

  
  :type CharacterSetName: string
  :param CharacterSetName: 

    For supported engines, the character set ( ``CharacterSet``) to associate the DB instance with.

     

    This setting doesn't apply to the following DB instances:

     

    
    * Amazon Aurora - The character set is managed by the DB cluster. For more information, see ``CreateDBCluster``.
     
    * RDS Custom - However, if you need to change the character set, you can change it on the database itself.
    

    

  
  :type NcharCharacterSetName: string
  :param NcharCharacterSetName: 

    The name of the NCHAR character set for the Oracle DB instance.

     

    This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

    

  
  :type PubliclyAccessible: boolean
  :param PubliclyAccessible: 

    Specifies whether the DB instance is publicly accessible.

     

    When the DB instance is publicly accessible and you connect from outside of the DB instance's virtual private cloud (VPC), its domain name system (DNS) endpoint resolves to the public IP address. When you connect from within the same VPC as the DB instance, the endpoint resolves to the private IP address. Access to the DB instance is controlled by its security group settings.

     

    When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB instance with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address.

     

    The default behavior when ``PubliclyAccessible`` is not specified depends on whether a ``DBSubnetGroup`` is specified.

     

    If ``DBSubnetGroup`` isn't specified, ``PubliclyAccessible`` defaults to ``false`` for Aurora instances and ``true`` for non-Aurora instances.

     

    If ``DBSubnetGroup`` is specified, ``PubliclyAccessible`` defaults to ``false`` unless the value of ``DBSubnetGroup`` is ``default``, in which case ``PubliclyAccessible`` defaults to ``true``.

     

    If ``PubliclyAccessible`` is true and the VPC that the ``DBSubnetGroup`` is in doesn't have an internet gateway attached to it, Amazon RDS returns an error.

    

  
  :type Tags: list
  :param Tags: 

    Tags to assign to the DB instance.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      Metadata assigned to an Amazon RDS resource consisting of a key-value pair.

       

      For more information, see `Tagging Amazon RDS resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_Tagging.html>`__ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide* or `Tagging Amazon Aurora and Amazon RDS resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_Tagging.html>`__ in the *Amazon Aurora User Guide*.

      

    
      - **Key** *(string) --* 

        A key is the required name of the tag. The string value can be from 1 to 128 Unicode characters in length and can't be prefixed with ``aws:`` or ``rds:``. The string can only contain only the set of Unicode letters, digits, white-space, '_', '.', ':', '/', '=', '+', '-', '@' (Java regex: "^([\\p{L}\\p{Z}\\p{N}_.:/=+\\-@]*)$").

        

      
      - **Value** *(string) --* 

        A value is the optional value of the tag. The string value can be from 1 to 256 Unicode characters in length and can't be prefixed with ``aws:`` or ``rds:``. The string can only contain only the set of Unicode letters, digits, white-space, '_', '.', ':', '/', '=', '+', '-', '@' (Java regex: "^([\\p{L}\\p{Z}\\p{N}_.:/=+\\-@]*)$").

        

      
    

  :type DBClusterIdentifier: string
  :param DBClusterIdentifier: 

    The identifier of the DB cluster that this DB instance will belong to.

     

    This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

    

  
  :type StorageType: string
  :param StorageType: 

    The storage type to associate with the DB instance.

     

    If you specify ``io1``, ``io2``, or ``gp3``, you must also include a value for the ``Iops`` parameter.

     

    This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora DB instances. Storage is managed by the DB cluster.

     

    Valid Values: ``gp2 | gp3 | io1 | io2 | standard``

     

    Default: ``io1``, if the ``Iops`` parameter is specified. Otherwise, ``gp3``.

    

  
  :type TdeCredentialArn: string
  :param TdeCredentialArn: 

    The ARN from the key store with which to associate the instance for TDE encryption.

     

    This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora or RDS Custom DB instances.

    

  
  :type TdeCredentialPassword: string
  :param TdeCredentialPassword: 

    The password for the given ARN from the key store in order to access the device.

     

    This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

    

  
  :type StorageEncrypted: boolean
  :param StorageEncrypted: 

    Specifes whether the DB instance is encrypted. By default, it isn't encrypted.

     

    For RDS Custom DB instances, either enable this setting or leave it unset. Otherwise, Amazon RDS reports an error.

     

    This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora DB instances. The encryption for DB instances is managed by the DB cluster.

    

  
  :type KmsKeyId: string
  :param KmsKeyId: 

    The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for an encrypted DB instance.

     

    The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key. To use a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account, specify the key ARN or alias ARN.

     

    This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora DB instances. The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is managed by the DB cluster. For more information, see ``CreateDBCluster``.

     

    If ``StorageEncrypted`` is enabled, and you do not specify a value for the ``KmsKeyId`` parameter, then Amazon RDS uses your default KMS key. There is a default KMS key for your Amazon Web Services account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a different default KMS key for each Amazon Web Services Region.

     

    For Amazon RDS Custom, a KMS key is required for DB instances. For most RDS engines, if you leave this parameter empty while enabling ``StorageEncrypted``, the engine uses the default KMS key. However, RDS Custom doesn't use the default key when this parameter is empty. You must explicitly specify a key.

    

  
  :type Domain: string
  :param Domain: 

    The Active Directory directory ID to create the DB instance in. Currently, you can create only Db2, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, and PostgreSQL DB instances in an Active Directory Domain.

    Example: ``OU=mymanagedADtestOU,DC=mymanagedADtest,DC=mymanagedAD,DC=mydomain``

    

  
  :type DomainAuthSecretArn: string
  :param DomainAuthSecretArn: 

    The ARN for the Secrets Manager secret with the credentials for the user joining the domain.

     

    Example: ``arn:aws:secretsmanager:region:account-number:secret:myselfmanagedADtestsecret-123456``

    

  
  :type DomainDnsIps: list
  :param DomainDnsIps: 

    The IPv4 DNS IP addresses of your primary and secondary Active Directory domain controllers.

     

    Constraints:

     

    
    * Two IP addresses must be provided. If there isn't a secondary domain controller, use the IP address of the primary domain controller for both entries in the list.
    

     

    Example: ``123.124.125.126,234.235.236.237``

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type CopyTagsToSnapshot: boolean
  :param CopyTagsToSnapshot: 

    Specifies whether to copy tags from the DB instance to snapshots of the DB instance. By default, tags are not copied.

     

    This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora DB instances. Copying tags to snapshots is managed by the DB cluster. Setting this value for an Aurora DB instance has no effect on the DB cluster setting.

    

  
  :type MonitoringInterval: integer
  :param MonitoringInterval: 

    The interval, in seconds, between points when Enhanced Monitoring metrics are collected for the DB instance. To disable collection of Enhanced Monitoring metrics, specify ``0``.

     

    If ``MonitoringRoleArn`` is specified, then you must set ``MonitoringInterval`` to a value other than ``0``.

     

    This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

     

    Valid Values: ``0 | 1 | 5 | 10 | 15 | 30 | 60``

     

    Default: ``0``

    

  
  :type MonitoringRoleArn: string
  :param MonitoringRoleArn: 

    The ARN for the IAM role that permits RDS to send enhanced monitoring metrics to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. For example, ``arn:aws:iam:123456789012:role/emaccess``. For information on creating a monitoring role, see `Setting Up and Enabling Enhanced Monitoring <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_Monitoring.OS.html#USER_Monitoring.OS.Enabling>`__ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.

     

    If ``MonitoringInterval`` is set to a value other than ``0``, then you must supply a ``MonitoringRoleArn`` value.

     

    This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

    

  
  :type DomainIAMRoleName: string
  :param DomainIAMRoleName: 

    The name of the IAM role to use when making API calls to the Directory Service.

     

    This setting doesn't apply to the following DB instances:

     

    
    * Amazon Aurora (The domain is managed by the DB cluster.)
     
    * RDS Custom
    

    

  
  :type PromotionTier: integer
  :param PromotionTier: 

    The order of priority in which an Aurora Replica is promoted to the primary instance after a failure of the existing primary instance.

    * Amazon Aurora (Mapping Amazon Web Services IAM accounts to database accounts is managed by the DB cluster.)
     
    * RDS Custom
    

    

  
  :type DatabaseInsightsMode: string
  :param DatabaseInsightsMode: 

    The mode of Database Insights to enable for the DB instance.

     

    .. note::

      

      Aurora DB instances inherit this value from the DB cluster, so you can't change this value.

      

    

  
  :type EnablePerformanceInsights: boolean
  :param EnablePerformanceInsights: 

    Specifies whether to enable Performance Insights for the DB instance. For more information, see `Using Amazon Performance Insights <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_PerfInsights.html>`__ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.

    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type ProcessorFeatures: list
  :param ProcessorFeatures: 

    The number of CPU cores and the number of threads per core for the DB instance class of the DB instance.

     

    This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora or RDS Custom DB instances.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      Contains the processor features of a DB instance class.

       

      To specify the number of CPU cores, use the ``coreCount`` feature name for the ``Name`` parameter. To specify the number of threads per core, use the ``threadsPerCore`` feature name for the ``Name`` parameter.

       

      You can set the processor features of the DB instance class for a DB instance when you call one of the following actions:

    * Amazon Aurora (Storage is managed by the DB cluster.)
     
    * RDS Custom
    

    

  
  :type EnableCustomerOwnedIp: boolean
  :param EnableCustomerOwnedIp: 

    Specifies whether to enable a customer-owned IP address (CoIP) for an RDS on Outposts DB instance.

     

    A *CoIP* provides local or external connectivity to resources in your Outpost subnets through your on-premises network. For some use cases, a CoIP can provide lower latency for connections to the DB instance from outside of its virtual private cloud (VPC) on your local network.

     

    For more information about RDS on Outposts, see `Working with Amazon RDS on Amazon Web Services Outposts <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-on-outposts.html>`__ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.

     

    For more information about CoIPs, see `Customer-owned IP addresses <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/outposts/latest/userguide/routing.html#ip-addressing>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services Outposts User Guide*.

    

  
  :type NetworkType: string
  :param NetworkType: 

    The network type of the DB instance.

     

    The network type is determined by the ``DBSubnetGroup`` specified for the DB instance. A ``DBSubnetGroup`` can support only the IPv4 protocol or the IPv4 and the IPv6 protocols ( ``DUAL``).

     

    For more information, see `Working with a DB instance in a VPC <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_VPC.WorkingWithRDSInstanceinaVPC.html>`__ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.*

     

    Valid Values: ``IPV4 | DUAL``

    

  
  :type BackupTarget: string
  :param BackupTarget: 

    The location for storing automated backups and manual snapshots.

    * ``outposts`` (Amazon Web Services Outposts)
     
    * ``region`` (Amazon Web Services Region)
    

     

    Default: ``region``

     

    For more information, see `Working with Amazon RDS on Amazon Web Services Outposts <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-on-outposts.html>`__ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.

    

  
  :type CustomIamInstanceProfile: string
  :param CustomIamInstanceProfile: 

    The instance profile associated with the underlying Amazon EC2 instance of an RDS Custom DB instance.

     

    This setting is required for RDS Custom.

     

    Constraints:

     

    
    * The profile must exist in your account.
     
    * The profile must have an IAM role that Amazon EC2 has permissions to assume.
     
    * The instance profile name and the associated IAM role name must start with the prefix ``AWSRDSCustom``.
    

     

    For the list of permissions required for the IAM role, see `Configure IAM and your VPC <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/custom-setup-orcl.html#custom-setup-orcl.iam-vpc>`__ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.

    

  
  :type DBSystemId: string
  :param DBSystemId: 

    The Oracle system identifier (SID), which is the name of the Oracle database instance that manages your database files. In this context, the term "Oracle database instance" refers exclusively to the system global area (SGA) and Oracle background processes. If you don't specify a SID, the value defaults to ``RDSCDB``. The Oracle SID is also the name of your CDB.

    

  
  :type CACertificateIdentifier: string
  :param CACertificateIdentifier: 

    The CA certificate identifier to use for the DB instance's server certificate.

     

    This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

     

    For more information, see `Using SSL/TLS to encrypt a connection to a DB instance <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html>`__ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide* and `Using SSL/TLS to encrypt a connection to a DB cluster <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html>`__ in the *Amazon Aurora User Guide*.

    

  
  :type ManageMasterUserPassword: boolean
  :param ManageMasterUserPassword: 

    Specifies whether to manage the master user password with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager.

     

    For more information, see `Password management with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-secrets-manager.html>`__ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.*

     

    Constraints:

     

    
    * Can't manage the master user password with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager if ``MasterUserPassword`` is specified.
    

    

  
  :type MasterUserSecretKmsKeyId: string
  :param MasterUserSecretKmsKeyId: 

    The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier to encrypt a secret that is automatically generated and managed in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager.

     

    This setting is valid only if the master user password is managed by RDS in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager for the DB instance.

     

    The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key. To use a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account, specify the key ARN or alias ARN.

     

    If you don't specify ``MasterUserSecretKmsKeyId``, then the ``aws/secretsmanager`` KMS key is used to encrypt the secret. If the secret is in a different Amazon Web Services account, then you can't use the ``aws/secretsmanager`` KMS key to encrypt the secret, and you must use a customer managed KMS key.

     

    There is a default KMS key for your Amazon Web Services account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a different default KMS key for each Amazon Web Services Region.

    

  
  :type MultiTenant: boolean
  :param MultiTenant: 

    Specifies whether to use the multi-tenant configuration or the single-tenant configuration (default). This parameter only applies to RDS for Oracle container database (CDB) engines.

     

    Note the following restrictions:

     

    
    * The DB engine that you specify in the request must support the multi-tenant configuration. If you attempt to enable the multi-tenant configuration on a DB engine that doesn't support it, the request fails.
     
    * If you specify the multi-tenant configuration when you create your DB instance, you can't later modify this DB instance to use the single-tenant configuration.
    

    

  
  :type DedicatedLogVolume: boolean
  :param DedicatedLogVolume: 

    Indicates whether the DB instance has a dedicated log volume (DLV) enabled.

    

  
  :type EngineLifecycleSupport: string
  :param EngineLifecycleSupport: 

    The life cycle type for this DB instance.

     

    .. note::

      

      By default, this value is set to ``open-source-rds-extended-support``, which enrolls your DB instance into Amazon RDS Extended Support. At the end of standard support, you can avoid charges for Extended Support by setting the value to ``open-source-rds-extended-support-disabled``. In this case, creating the DB instance will fail if the DB major version is past its end of standard support date.

      

     

    This setting applies only to RDS for MySQL and RDS for PostgreSQL. For Amazon Aurora DB instances, the life cycle type is managed by the DB cluster.

     

    You can use this setting to enroll your DB instance into Amazon RDS Extended Support. With RDS Extended Support, you can run the selected major engine version on your DB instance past the end of standard support for that engine version. For more information, see `Amazon RDS Extended Support with Amazon RDS <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/extended-support.html>`__ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.

     

    Valid Values: ``open-source-rds-extended-support | open-source-rds-extended-support-disabled``

     

    Default: ``open-source-rds-extended-support``

    

  
  :type AdditionalStorageVolumes: list

            - *(dict) --* 

              Contains the processor features of a DB instance class.

               

              To specify the number of CPU cores, use the ``coreCount`` feature name for the ``Name`` parameter. To specify the number of threads per core, use the ``threadsPerCore`` feature name for the ``Name`` parameter.

               

              You can set the processor features of the DB instance class for a DB instance when you call one of the following actions:

               

              
              * ``CreateDBInstance``
               
              * ``ModifyDBInstance``
               
              * ``RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot``
               
              * ``RestoreDBInstanceFromS3``
               
              * ``RestoreDBInstanceToPointInTime``
              

               

              You can view the valid processor values for a particular instance class by calling the ``DescribeOrderableDBInstanceOptions`` action and specifying the instance class for the ``DBInstanceClass`` parameter.

               

              In addition, you can use the following actions for DB instance class processor information:

               

              
              * ``DescribeDBInstances``
               
              * ``DescribeDBSnapshots``
               
              * ``DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications``
              

               

              If you call ``DescribeDBInstances``, ``ProcessorFeature`` returns non-null values only if the following conditions are met:

               

              
              * You are accessing an Oracle or SQL Server DB instance.
               
              * Your Oracle or SQL Server DB instance class supports configuring the number of CPU cores and threads per core.
               
              * The current number CPU cores and threads is set to a non-default value.

When you connect from within the same VPC as the DB instance, the endpoint resolves to the private IP address. Access to the DB cluster is ultimately controlled by the security group it uses. That public access isn't permitted if the security group assigned to the DB cluster doesn't permit it.

           

          When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB instance with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address.

            Contains the processor features of a DB instance class.

             

            To specify the number of CPU cores, use the ``coreCount`` feature name for the ``Name`` parameter. To specify the number of threads per core, use the ``threadsPerCore`` feature name for the ``Name`` parameter.

             

            You can set the processor features of the DB instance class for a DB instance when you call one of the following actions:

             

            
            * ``CreateDBInstance``
             
            * ``ModifyDBInstance``

            You can view the valid processor values for a particular instance class by calling the ``DescribeOrderableDBInstanceOptions`` action and specifying the instance class for the ``DBInstanceClass`` parameter.

             

            In addition, you can use the following actions for DB instance class processor information:

             

            
            * ``DescribeDBInstances``
             
            * ``DescribeDBSnapshots``
             
            * ``DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications``
            

             

            If you call ``DescribeDBInstances``, ``ProcessorFeature`` returns non-null values only if the following conditions are met:

             

            
            * You are accessing an Oracle or SQL Server DB instance.
             
            * Your Oracle or SQL Server DB instance class supports configuring the number of CPU cores and threads per core.
             
            * The current number CPU cores and threads is set to a non-default value.

            - **VolumeName** *(string) --* 

              The name of the additional storage volume.

              
            

            - **StorageVolumeStatus** *(string) --* 

              The status of the additional storage volume.

               

              Valid Values: ``ACTIVE | CREATING | DELETING | MODIFYING | NOT-IN-USE | STORAGE-OPTIMIZATION | VOLUME-FULL``

              
            

            - **AllocatedStorage** *(integer) --* 

              The amount of storage allocated for the additional storage volume, in gibibytes (GiB). The minimum is 20 GiB. The maximum is 65,536 GiB (64 TiB).

              
            

            - **IOPS** *(integer) --* 

              The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS) provisioned for the additional storage volume.

              
            

            - **MaxAllocatedStorage** *(integer) --* 

              The upper limit in gibibytes (GiB) to which RDS can automatically scale the storage of the additional storage volume.

              
            

            - **StorageThroughput** *(integer) --* 

              The storage throughput value for the additional storage volume, in mebibytes per second (MiBps).

              
            

            - **StorageType** *(string) --*

  **Examples**

  This example creates a DB instance.
  ::

    response = client.create_db_instance(
        AllocatedStorage=5,
        DBInstanceClass='db.t2.micro',
        DBInstanceIdentifier='mymysqlinstance',
        Engine='MySQL',
        MasterUserPassword='MyPassword',
        MasterUsername='MyUser',
    )
    
    print(response)

  
  Expected Output:
  ::

    {
        'DBInstance': {
        },
        'ResponseMetadata': {
            '...': '...',
        },
    }
