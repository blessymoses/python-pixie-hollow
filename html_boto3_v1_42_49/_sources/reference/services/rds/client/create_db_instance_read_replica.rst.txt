.. py:method:: RDS.Client.create_db_instance_read_replica(**kwargs)

  

  Creates a new DB instance that acts as a read replica for an existing source DB instance or Multi-AZ DB cluster. You can create a read replica for a DB instance running Db2, MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server. You can create a read replica for a Multi-AZ DB cluster running MySQL or PostgreSQL. For more information, see `Working with read replicas <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ReadRepl.html>`__ and `Migrating from a Multi-AZ DB cluster to a DB instance using a read replica <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/multi-az-db-clusters-concepts.html#multi-az-db-clusters-migrating-to-instance-with-read-replica>`__ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.

   

  Amazon Aurora doesn't support this operation. To create a DB instance for an Aurora DB cluster, use the ``CreateDBInstance`` operation.

   

  RDS creates read replicas with backups disabled. All other attributes (including DB security groups and DB parameter groups) are inherited from the source DB instance or cluster, except as specified.

   

  .. warning::

     

    Your source DB instance or cluster must have backup retention enabled.

  :type DBInstanceIdentifier: string
  :param DBInstanceIdentifier: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The DB instance identifier of the read replica. This identifier is the unique key that identifies a DB instance. This parameter is stored as a lowercase string.

    

  
  :type SourceDBInstanceIdentifier: string
  :param SourceDBInstanceIdentifier: 

    The identifier of the DB instance that will act as the source for the read replica. Each DB instance can have up to 15 read replicas, except for the following engines:

     

    
    * Db2 - Can have up to three replicas.
     
    * Oracle - Can have up to five read replicas.
     
    * SQL Server - Can have up to five read replicas.
    

     

    Constraints:

     

    
    * Must be the identifier of an existing Db2, MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server DB instance.
     
    * Can't be specified if the ``SourceDBClusterIdentifier`` parameter is also specified.
     
    * For the limitations of Oracle read replicas, see `Version and licensing considerations for RDS for Oracle replicas <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/oracle-read-replicas.limitations.html#oracle-read-replicas.limitations.versions-and-licenses>`__ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.
     
    * For the limitations of SQL Server read replicas, see `Read replica limitations with SQL Server <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/SQLServer.ReadReplicas.html#SQLServer.ReadReplicas.Limitations>`__ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.
     
    * The specified DB instance must have automatic backups enabled, that is, its backup retention period must be greater than 0.
     
    * If the source DB instance is in the same Amazon Web Services Region as the read replica, specify a valid DB instance identifier.
     
    * If the source DB instance is in a different Amazon Web Services Region from the read replica, specify a valid DB instance ARN. For more information, see `Constructing an ARN for Amazon RDS <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_Tagging.ARN.html#USER_Tagging.ARN.Constructing>`__ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*. This doesn't apply to SQL Server or RDS Custom, which don't support cross-Region replicas.
    

    

  
  :type DBInstanceClass: string
  :param DBInstanceClass: 

    The compute and memory capacity of the read replica, for example db.m4.large. Not all DB instance classes are available in all Amazon Web Services Regions, or for all database engines. For the full list of DB instance classes, and availability for your engine, see `DB Instance Class <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.DBInstanceClass.html>`__ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.

     

    Default: Inherits the value from the source DB instance.

    

  
  :type AvailabilityZone: string
  :param AvailabilityZone: 

    The Availability Zone (AZ) where the read replica will be created.

     

    Default: A random, system-chosen Availability Zone in the endpoint's Amazon Web Services Region.

     

    Example: ``us-east-1d``

    

  
  :type Port: integer
  :param Port: 

    The port number that the DB instance uses for connections.

     

    Valid Values: ``1150-65535``

     

    Default: Inherits the value from the source DB instance.

    

  
  :type MultiAZ: boolean
  :param MultiAZ: 

    Specifies whether the read replica is in a Multi-AZ deployment.

     

    You can create a read replica as a Multi-AZ DB instance. RDS creates a standby of your replica in another Availability Zone for failover support for the replica. Creating your read replica as a Multi-AZ DB instance is independent of whether the source is a Multi-AZ DB instance or a Multi-AZ DB cluster.

     

    This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

    

  
  :type AutoMinorVersionUpgrade: boolean
  :param AutoMinorVersionUpgrade: 

    Specifies whether to automatically apply minor engine upgrades to the read replica during the maintenance window.

     

    This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

     

    Default: Inherits the value from the source DB instance.

     

    For more information about automatic minor version upgrades, see `Automatically upgrading the minor engine version <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_UpgradeDBInstance.Upgrading.html#USER_UpgradeDBInstance.Upgrading.AutoMinorVersionUpgrades>`__.

    

  
  :type Iops: integer
  :param Iops: 

    The amount of Provisioned IOPS (input/output operations per second) to initially allocate for the DB instance.

    

  
  :type StorageThroughput: integer
  :param StorageThroughput: 

    Specifies the storage throughput value for the read replica.

     

    This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom or Amazon Aurora DB instances.

    

  
  :type OptionGroupName: string
  :param OptionGroupName: 

    The option group to associate the DB instance with. If not specified, RDS uses the option group associated with the source DB instance or cluster.

     

    .. note::

      

      For SQL Server, you must use the option group associated with the source.

      

     

    This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

    

  
  :type DBParameterGroupName: string
  :param DBParameterGroupName: 

    The name of the DB parameter group to associate with this read replica DB instance.

     

    For the Db2 DB engine, if your source DB instance uses the bring your own license (BYOL) model, then a custom parameter group must be associated with the replica. For a same Amazon Web Services Region replica, if you don't specify a custom parameter group, Amazon RDS associates the custom parameter group associated with the source DB instance. For a cross-Region replica, you must specify a custom parameter group. This custom parameter group must include your IBM Site ID and IBM Customer ID. For more information, see `IBM IDs for bring your own license (BYOL) for Db2 <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/db2-licensing.html#db2-prereqs-ibm-info>`__.

     

    For Single-AZ or Multi-AZ DB instance read replica instances, if you don't specify a value for ``DBParameterGroupName``, then Amazon RDS uses the ``DBParameterGroup`` of the source DB instance for a same Region read replica, or the default ``DBParameterGroup`` for the specified DB engine for a cross-Region read replica.

     

    For Multi-AZ DB cluster same Region read replica instances, if you don't specify a value for ``DBParameterGroupName``, then Amazon RDS uses the default ``DBParameterGroup``.

     

    Specifying a parameter group for this operation is only supported for MySQL DB instances for cross-Region read replicas, for Multi-AZ DB cluster read replica instances, for Db2 DB instances, and for Oracle DB instances. It isn't supported for MySQL DB instances for same Region read replicas or for RDS Custom.

     

    Constraints:

     

    
    * Must be 1 to 255 letters, numbers, or hyphens.
     
    * First character must be a letter.
     
    * Can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.
    

    

  
  :type PubliclyAccessible: boolean
  :param PubliclyAccessible: 

    Specifies whether the DB instance is publicly accessible.

     

    When the DB cluster is publicly accessible, its Domain Name System (DNS) endpoint resolves to the private IP address from within the DB cluster's virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves to the public IP address from outside of the DB cluster's VPC. Access to the DB cluster is ultimately controlled by the security group it uses. That public access isn't permitted if the security group assigned to the DB cluster doesn't permit it.

     

    When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB instance with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address.

     

    For more information, see  CreateDBInstance.

    

  
  :type Tags: list
  :param Tags: 

    A list of tags.

     

    For more information, see `Tagging Amazon RDS resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_Tagging.html>`__ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide* or `Tagging Amazon Aurora and Amazon RDS resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_Tagging.html>`__ in the *Amazon Aurora User Guide*.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      Metadata assigned to an Amazon RDS resource consisting of a key-value pair.

       

      For more information, see `Tagging Amazon RDS resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_Tagging.html>`__ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide* or `Tagging Amazon Aurora and Amazon RDS resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_Tagging.html>`__ in the *Amazon Aurora User Guide*.

      

    
      - **Key** *(string) --* 

        A key is the required name of the tag. The string value can be from 1 to 128 Unicode characters in length and can't be prefixed with ``aws:`` or ``rds:``. The string can only contain only the set of Unicode letters, digits, white-space, '_', '.', ':', '/', '=', '+', '-', '@' (Java regex: "^([\\p{L}\\p{Z}\\p{N}_.:/=+\\-@]*)$").

        

      
      - **Value** *(string) --* 

        A value is the optional value of the tag. The string value can be from 1 to 256 Unicode characters in length and can't be prefixed with ``aws:`` or ``rds:``. The string can only contain only the set of Unicode letters, digits, white-space, '_', '.', ':', '/', '=', '+', '-', '@' (Java regex: "^([\\p{L}\\p{Z}\\p{N}_.:/=+\\-@]*)$").

        

      
    

  :type DBSubnetGroupName: string
  :param DBSubnetGroupName: 

    A DB subnet group for the DB instance. The new DB instance is created in the VPC associated with the DB subnet group. If no DB subnet group is specified, then the new DB instance isn't created in a VPC.

     

    Constraints:

     

    
    * If supplied, must match the name of an existing DB subnet group.
     
    * The specified DB subnet group must be in the same Amazon Web Services Region in which the operation is running.
     
    * All read replicas in one Amazon Web Services Region that are created from the same source DB instance must either: 

      
      * Specify DB subnet groups from the same VPC. All these read replicas are created in the same VPC.
       
      * Not specify a DB subnet group. All these read replicas are created outside of any VPC.
      

    
    

     

    Example: ``mydbsubnetgroup``

    

  
  :type VpcSecurityGroupIds: list
  :param VpcSecurityGroupIds: 

    A list of Amazon EC2 VPC security groups to associate with the read replica.

     

    This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

     

    Default: The default EC2 VPC security group for the DB subnet group's VPC.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type StorageType: string
  :param StorageType: 

    The storage type to associate with the read replica.

     

    If you specify ``io1``, ``io2``, or ``gp3``, you must also include a value for the ``Iops`` parameter.

     

    Valid Values: ``gp2 | gp3 | io1 | io2 | standard``

     

    Default: ``io1`` if the ``Iops`` parameter is specified. Otherwise, ``gp3``.

    

  
  :type CopyTagsToSnapshot: boolean
  :param CopyTagsToSnapshot: 

    Specifies whether to copy all tags from the read replica to snapshots of the read replica. By default, tags aren't copied.

    

  
  :type MonitoringInterval: integer
  :param MonitoringInterval: 

    The interval, in seconds, between points when Enhanced Monitoring metrics are collected for the read replica. To disable collection of Enhanced Monitoring metrics, specify ``0``. The default is ``0``.

     

    If ``MonitoringRoleArn`` is specified, then you must set ``MonitoringInterval`` to a value other than ``0``.

     

    This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

     

    Valid Values: ``0, 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60``

     

    Default: ``0``

    

  
  :type MonitoringRoleArn: string
  :param MonitoringRoleArn: 

    The ARN for the IAM role that permits RDS to send enhanced monitoring metrics to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. For example, ``arn:aws:iam:123456789012:role/emaccess``. For information on creating a monitoring role, go to `To create an IAM role for Amazon RDS Enhanced Monitoring <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_Monitoring.html#USER_Monitoring.OS.IAMRole>`__ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.

     

    If ``MonitoringInterval`` is set to a value other than 0, then you must supply a ``MonitoringRoleArn`` value.

     

    This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

    

  
  :type KmsKeyId: string
  :param KmsKeyId: 

    The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for an encrypted read replica.

     

    The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key.

     

    If you create an encrypted read replica in the same Amazon Web Services Region as the source DB instance or Multi-AZ DB cluster, don't specify a value for this parameter. A read replica in the same Amazon Web Services Region is always encrypted with the same KMS key as the source DB instance or cluster.

     

    If you create an encrypted read replica in a different Amazon Web Services Region, then you must specify a KMS key identifier for the destination Amazon Web Services Region. KMS keys are specific to the Amazon Web Services Region that they are created in, and you can't use KMS keys from one Amazon Web Services Region in another Amazon Web Services Region.

     

    You can't create an encrypted read replica from an unencrypted DB instance or Multi-AZ DB cluster.

     

    This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom, which uses the same KMS key as the primary replica.

    

  
  :type PreSignedUrl: string
  :param PreSignedUrl: 

    When you are creating a read replica from one Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region to another or from one China Amazon Web Services Region to another, the URL that contains a Signature Version 4 signed request for the ``CreateDBInstanceReadReplica`` API operation in the source Amazon Web Services Region that contains the source DB instance.

     

    This setting applies only to Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Regions and China Amazon Web Services Regions. It's ignored in other Amazon Web Services Regions.

     

    This setting applies only when replicating from a source DB *instance*. Source DB clusters aren't supported in Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Regions and China Amazon Web Services Regions.

     

    You must specify this parameter when you create an encrypted read replica from another Amazon Web Services Region by using the Amazon RDS API. Don't specify ``PreSignedUrl`` when you are creating an encrypted read replica in the same Amazon Web Services Region.

     

    The presigned URL must be a valid request for the ``CreateDBInstanceReadReplica`` API operation that can run in the source Amazon Web Services Region that contains the encrypted source DB instance. The presigned URL request must contain the following parameter values:

     

    
    * ``DestinationRegion`` - The Amazon Web Services Region that the encrypted read replica is created in. This Amazon Web Services Region is the same one where the ``CreateDBInstanceReadReplica`` operation is called that contains this presigned URL. For example, if you create an encrypted DB instance in the us-west-1 Amazon Web Services Region, from a source DB instance in the us-east-2 Amazon Web Services Region, then you call the ``CreateDBInstanceReadReplica`` operation in the us-east-1 Amazon Web Services Region and provide a presigned URL that contains a call to the ``CreateDBInstanceReadReplica`` operation in the us-west-2 Amazon Web Services Region. For this example, the ``DestinationRegion`` in the presigned URL must be set to the us-east-1 Amazon Web Services Region.
     
    * ``KmsKeyId`` - The KMS key identifier for the key to use to encrypt the read replica in the destination Amazon Web Services Region. This is the same identifier for both the ``CreateDBInstanceReadReplica`` operation that is called in the destination Amazon Web Services Region, and the operation contained in the presigned URL.
     
    * ``SourceDBInstanceIdentifier`` - The DB instance identifier for the encrypted DB instance to be replicated. This identifier must be in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for the source Amazon Web Services Region. For example, if you are creating an encrypted read replica from a DB instance in the us-west-2 Amazon Web Services Region, then your ``SourceDBInstanceIdentifier`` looks like the following example: ``arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:instance:mysql-instance1-20161115``.
    

     

    To learn how to generate a Signature Version 4 signed request, see `Authenticating Requests\: Using Query Parameters (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-query-string-auth.html>`__ and `Signature Version 4 Signing Process <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html>`__.

     

    .. note::

      

      If you are using an Amazon Web Services SDK tool or the CLI, you can specify ``SourceRegion`` (or ``--source-region`` for the CLI) instead of specifying ``PreSignedUrl`` manually. Specifying ``SourceRegion`` autogenerates a presigned URL that is a valid request for the operation that can run in the source Amazon Web Services Region.

      

     

    This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

        Please note that this parameter is automatically populated if it is not provided. Including this parameter is not required



  
  :type EnableIAMDatabaseAuthentication: boolean
  :param EnableIAMDatabaseAuthentication: 

    Specifies whether to enable mapping of Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management (IAM) accounts to database accounts. By default, mapping isn't enabled.

     

    For more information about IAM database authentication, see `IAM Database Authentication for MySQL and PostgreSQL <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.IAMDBAuth.html>`__ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.

     

    This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

    

  
  :type DatabaseInsightsMode: string
  :param DatabaseInsightsMode: 

    The mode of Database Insights to enable for the read replica.

     

    .. note::

      

      This setting isn't supported.

      

    

  
  :type EnablePerformanceInsights: boolean
  :param EnablePerformanceInsights: 

    Specifies whether to enable Performance Insights for the read replica.

     

    For more information, see `Using Amazon Performance Insights <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_PerfInsights.html>`__ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.

     

    This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

    

  
  :type PerformanceInsightsKMSKeyId: string
  :param PerformanceInsightsKMSKeyId: 

    The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for encryption of Performance Insights data.

     

    The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key.

     

    If you do not specify a value for ``PerformanceInsightsKMSKeyId``, then Amazon RDS uses your default KMS key. There is a default KMS key for your Amazon Web Services account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a different default KMS key for each Amazon Web Services Region.

     

    This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

    

  
  :type PerformanceInsightsRetentionPeriod: integer
  :param PerformanceInsightsRetentionPeriod: 

    The number of days to retain Performance Insights data.

     

    This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

     

    Valid Values:

     

    
    * ``7``
     
    * *month* * 31, where *month* is a number of months from 1-23. Examples: ``93`` (3 months * 31), ``341`` (11 months * 31), ``589`` (19 months * 31)
     
    * ``731``
    

     

    Default: ``7`` days

     

    If you specify a retention period that isn't valid, such as ``94``, Amazon RDS returns an error.

    

  
  :type EnableCloudwatchLogsExports: list
  :param EnableCloudwatchLogsExports: 

    The list of logs that the new DB instance is to export to CloudWatch Logs. The values in the list depend on the DB engine being used. For more information, see `Publishing Database Logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_LogAccess.html#USER_LogAccess.Procedural.UploadtoCloudWatch>`__ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.

    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type ProcessorFeatures: list
  :param ProcessorFeatures: 

    The number of CPU cores and the number of threads per core for the DB instance class of the DB instance.

     

    This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      Contains the processor features of a DB instance class.

       

      To specify the number of CPU cores, use the ``coreCount`` feature name for the ``Name`` parameter. To specify the number of threads per core, use the ``threadsPerCore`` feature name for the ``Name`` parameter.

       

      You can set the processor features of the DB instance class for a DB instance when you call one of the following actions:

       

      
      * ``CreateDBInstance``
       
      * ``ModifyDBInstance``
       
      * ``RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot``
       
      * ``RestoreDBInstanceFromS3``
       
      * ``RestoreDBInstanceToPointInTime``
      

       

      You can view the valid processor values for a particular instance class by calling the ``DescribeOrderableDBInstanceOptions`` action and specifying the instance class for the ``DBInstanceClass`` parameter.

       

      In addition, you can use the following actions for DB instance class processor information:

       

      
      * ``DescribeDBInstances``
       
      * ``DescribeDBSnapshots``
       
      * ``DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications``
      

       

      If you call ``DescribeDBInstances``, ``ProcessorFeature`` returns non-null values only if the following conditions are met:

       

      
      * You are accessing an Oracle or SQL Server DB instance.
       
      * Your Oracle or SQL Server DB instance class supports configuring the number of CPU cores and threads per core.
       
      * The current number CPU cores and threads is set to a non-default value.

  :type ReplicaMode: string
  :param ReplicaMode: 

    The open mode of the replica database.

     

    This parameter is only supported for Db2 DB instances and Oracle DB instances.

      Db2  

    Standby DB replicas are included in Db2 Advanced Edition (AE) and Db2 Standard Edition (SE). The main use case for standby replicas is cross-Region disaster recovery. Because it doesn't accept user connections, a standby replica can't serve a read-only workload.

     

    You can create a combination of standby and read-only DB replicas for the same primary DB instance. For more information, see `Working with replicas for Amazon RDS for Db2 <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/db2-replication.html>`__ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.

     

    To create standby DB replicas for RDS for Db2, set this parameter to ``mounted``.

      Oracle  

    Mounted DB replicas are included in Oracle Database Enterprise Edition. The main use case for mounted replicas is cross-Region disaster recovery. The primary database doesn't use Active Data Guard to transmit information to the mounted replica. Because it doesn't accept user connections, a mounted replica can't serve a read-only workload.

     

    You can create a combination of mounted and read-only DB replicas for the same primary DB instance. For more information, see `Working with read replicas for Amazon RDS for Oracle <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/oracle-read-replicas.html>`__ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.

     

    For RDS Custom, you must specify this parameter and set it to ``mounted``. The value won't be set by default. After replica creation, you can manage the open mode manually.

    

  
  :type EnableCustomerOwnedIp: boolean
  :param EnableCustomerOwnedIp: 

    Specifies whether to enable a customer-owned IP address (CoIP) for an RDS on Outposts read replica.

     

    A *CoIP* provides local or external connectivity to resources in your Outpost subnets through your on-premises network. For some use cases, a CoIP can provide lower latency for connections to the read replica from outside of its virtual private cloud (VPC) on your local network.

     

    For more information about RDS on Outposts, see `Working with Amazon RDS on Amazon Web Services Outposts <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-on-outposts.html>`__ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.

     

    For more information about CoIPs, see `Customer-owned IP addresses <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/outposts/latest/userguide/routing.html#ip-addressing>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services Outposts User Guide*.

    

  
  :type NetworkType: string

    * The instance profile name and the associated IAM role name must start with the prefix ``AWSRDSCustom``.
    

     

    For the list of permissions required for the IAM role, see `Configure IAM and your VPC <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/custom-setup-orcl.html#custom-setup-orcl.iam-vpc>`__ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.

     

    This setting is required for RDS Custom DB instances.

    

  
  :type AllocatedStorage: integer
  :param AllocatedStorage: 

    The amount of storage (in gibibytes) to allocate initially for the read replica. Follow the allocation rules specified in ``CreateDBInstance``.

     

    This setting isn't valid for RDS for SQL Server.

     

    .. note::

      

      Be sure to allocate enough storage for your read replica so that the create operation can succeed. You can also allocate additional storage for future growth.

      

    

  
  :type SourceDBClusterIdentifier: string
  :param SourceDBClusterIdentifier: 

    The identifier of the Multi-AZ DB cluster that will act as the source for the read replica. Each DB cluster can have up to 15 read replicas.

            - *(dict) --* 

              Contains the processor features of a DB instance class.

               

              To specify the number of CPU cores, use the ``coreCount`` feature name for the ``Name`` parameter. To specify the number of threads per core, use the ``threadsPerCore`` feature name for the ``Name`` parameter.

               

              You can set the processor features of the DB instance class for a DB instance when you call one of the following actions:

               

              
              * ``CreateDBInstance``
               
              * ``ModifyDBInstance``
               
              * ``RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot``
               
              * ``RestoreDBInstanceFromS3``
               
              * ``RestoreDBInstanceToPointInTime``
              

               

              You can view the valid processor values for a particular instance class by calling the ``DescribeOrderableDBInstanceOptions`` action and specifying the instance class for the ``DBInstanceClass`` parameter.

               

              In addition, you can use the following actions for DB instance class processor information:

               

              
              * ``DescribeDBInstances``
               
              * ``DescribeDBSnapshots``
               
              * ``DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications``
              

               

              If you call ``DescribeDBInstances``, ``ProcessorFeature`` returns non-null values only if the following conditions are met:

               

              
              * You are accessing an Oracle or SQL Server DB instance.
               
              * Your Oracle or SQL Server DB instance class supports configuring the number of CPU cores and threads per core.
               
              * The current number CPU cores and threads is set to a non-default value.

          The secret managed by RDS in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager for the master user password.

           

          For more information, see `Password management with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-secrets-manager.html>`__ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.*

          
          

          - **SecretArn** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the secret.

            
          

          - **SecretStatus** *(string) --* 

            The status of the secret.

             

            The possible status values include the following:

             

            
            * ``creating`` - The secret is being created.
             
            * ``active`` - The secret is available for normal use and rotation.
             
            * ``rotating`` - The secret is being rotated.
             
            * ``impaired`` - The secret can be used to access database credentials, but it can't be rotated. A secret might have this status if, for example, permissions are changed so that RDS can no longer access either the secret or the KMS key for the secret. When a secret has this status, you can correct the condition that caused the status. Alternatively, modify the DB instance to turn off automatic management of database credentials, and then modify the DB instance again to turn on automatic management of database credentials.
            

            
          

          - **KmsKeyId** *(string) --*

        CopyTagsToSnapshot=True,
        DBInstanceClass='db.t2.micro',
        DBInstanceIdentifier='mydbreadreplica',
        PubliclyAccessible=True,
        SourceDBInstanceIdentifier='mymysqlinstance',
        StorageType='gp2',
        Tags=[
            {
                'Key': 'mydbreadreplicakey',
                'Value': 'mydbreadreplicavalue',
            },
        ],
    )
