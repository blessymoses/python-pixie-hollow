.. py:method:: RDS.Client.restore_db_instance_to_point_in_time(**kwargs)

  

  Restores a DB instance to an arbitrary point in time. You can restore to any point in time before the time identified by the ``LatestRestorableTime`` property. You can restore to a point up to the number of days specified by the ``BackupRetentionPeriod`` property.

   

  The target database is created with most of the original configuration, but in a system-selected Availability Zone, with the default security group, the default subnet group, and the default DB parameter group. By default, the new DB instance is created as a single-AZ deployment except when the instance is a SQL Server instance that has an option group that is associated with mirroring; in this case, the instance becomes a mirrored deployment and not a single-AZ deployment.

   

  .. note::

    

    This operation doesn't apply to Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL. For Aurora, use ``RestoreDBClusterToPointInTime``.

      You can view the valid processor values for a particular instance class by calling the ``DescribeOrderableDBInstanceOptions`` action and specifying the instance class for the ``DBInstanceClass`` parameter.

       

      In addition, you can use the following actions for DB instance class processor information:

       

      
      * ``DescribeDBInstances``
       
      * ``DescribeDBSnapshots``
       
      * ``DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications``
      

       

      If you call ``DescribeDBInstances``, ``ProcessorFeature`` returns non-null values only if the following conditions are met:

       

      
      * You are accessing an Oracle or SQL Server DB instance.
       
      * Your Oracle or SQL Server DB instance class supports configuring the number of CPU cores and threads per core.
       
      * The current number CPU cores and threads is set to a non-default value.
      

       

      For more information, see `Configuring the processor for a DB instance class in RDS for Oracle <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.DBInstanceClass.html#USER_ConfigureProcessor>`__, `Optimizing your RDS for SQL Server CPU <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/SQLServer.Concepts.General.OptimizeCPU.html>`__, and `DB instance classes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.DBInstanceClass.html>`__ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.*

  :type BackupRetentionPeriod: integer
  :param BackupRetentionPeriod: 

    The number of days to retain automated backups. Setting this parameter to a positive number enables backups. Setting this parameter to 0 disables automated backups.

     

    .. note::

      

      Enabling and disabling backups can result in a brief I/O suspension that lasts from a few seconds to a few minutes, depending on the size and class of your DB instance.

      

     

    This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora DB instances. The retention period for automated backups is managed by the DB cluster. For more information, see ``ModifyDBCluster``.

    Constraints:

     

    
    * Must be a value from 0 to 35.
     
    * Can't be set to 0 if the DB instance is a source to read replicas.
     
    * Can't be set to 0 for an RDS Custom for Oracle DB instance.
    

    

  
  :type PreferredBackupWindow: string
  :param PreferredBackupWindow: 

    The daily time range during which automated backups are created if automated backups are enabled, as determined by the ``BackupRetentionPeriod`` parameter. Changing this parameter doesn't result in an outage and the change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible. The default is a 30-minute window selected at random from an 8-hour block of time for each Amazon Web Services Region. For more information, see `Backup window <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_WorkingWithAutomatedBackups.html#USER_WorkingWithAutomatedBackups.BackupWindow>`__ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.

     

    This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora DB instances. The daily time range for creating automated backups is managed by the DB cluster. For more information, see ``ModifyDBCluster``.

     

    Constraints:

     

    
    * Must be in the format ``hh24:mi-hh24:mi``.
     
    * Must be in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).
     
    * Must not conflict with the preferred maintenance window.
     
    * Must be at least 30 minutes.

  :type EngineLifecycleSupport: string
  :param EngineLifecycleSupport: 

    The life cycle type for this DB instance.

     

    .. note::

      

      By default, this value is set to ``open-source-rds-extended-support``, which enrolls your DB instance into Amazon RDS Extended Support. At the end of standard support, you can avoid charges for Extended Support by setting the value to ``open-source-rds-extended-support-disabled``. In this case, RDS automatically upgrades your restored DB instance to a higher engine version, if the major engine version is past its end of standard support date.

      

     

    You can use this setting to enroll your DB instance into Amazon RDS Extended Support. With RDS Extended Support, you can run the selected major engine version on your DB instance past the end of standard support for that engine version. For more information, see `Amazon RDS Extended Support with Amazon RDS <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/extended-support.html>`__ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.

            - *(dict) --* 

              Contains the processor features of a DB instance class.

               

              To specify the number of CPU cores, use the ``coreCount`` feature name for the ``Name`` parameter. To specify the number of threads per core, use the ``threadsPerCore`` feature name for the ``Name`` parameter.

               

              You can set the processor features of the DB instance class for a DB instance when you call one of the following actions:

               

              
              * ``CreateDBInstance``
               
              * ``ModifyDBInstance``
               
              * ``RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot``
               
              * ``RestoreDBInstanceFromS3``
               
              * ``RestoreDBInstanceToPointInTime``
              

               

              You can view the valid processor values for a particular instance class by calling the ``DescribeOrderableDBInstanceOptions`` action and specifying the instance class for the ``DBInstanceClass`` parameter.

               

              In addition, you can use the following actions for DB instance class processor information:

               

              
              * ``DescribeDBInstances``
               
              * ``DescribeDBSnapshots``
               
              * ``DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications``
              

               

              If you call ``DescribeDBInstances``, ``ProcessorFeature`` returns non-null values only if the following conditions are met:

               

              
              * You are accessing an Oracle or SQL Server DB instance.
               
              * Your Oracle or SQL Server DB instance class supports configuring the number of CPU cores and threads per core.
               
              * The current number CPU cores and threads is set to a non-default value.

            Contains the processor features of a DB instance class.

             

            To specify the number of CPU cores, use the ``coreCount`` feature name for the ``Name`` parameter. To specify the number of threads per core, use the ``threadsPerCore`` feature name for the ``Name`` parameter.

             

            You can set the processor features of the DB instance class for a DB instance when you call one of the following actions:

             

            
            * ``CreateDBInstance``
             
            * ``ModifyDBInstance``

            You can view the valid processor values for a particular instance class by calling the ``DescribeOrderableDBInstanceOptions`` action and specifying the instance class for the ``DBInstanceClass`` parameter.

             

            In addition, you can use the following actions for DB instance class processor information:

             

            
            * ``DescribeDBInstances``
             
            * ``DescribeDBSnapshots``
             
            * ``DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications``
            

             

            If you call ``DescribeDBInstances``, ``ProcessorFeature`` returns non-null values only if the following conditions are met:

             

            
            * You are accessing an Oracle or SQL Server DB instance.
             
            * Your Oracle or SQL Server DB instance class supports configuring the number of CPU cores and threads per core.
             
            * The current number CPU cores and threads is set to a non-default value.

  **Examples**

  The following example restores a DB instance to a new DB instance at a point in time from the source DB instance.
  ::

    response = client.restore_db_instance_to_point_in_time(
        RestoreTime=datetime(2016, 9, 13, 18, 45, 0, 1, 257, 0),
        SourceDBInstanceIdentifier='mysql-sample',
        TargetDBInstanceIdentifier='mysql-sample-restored',
    )
    
    print(response)
