.. py:method:: RDS.Client.restore_db_instance_from_s3(**kwargs)

  

  Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) supports importing MySQL databases by using backup files. You can create a backup of your on-premises database, store it on Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), and then restore the backup file onto a new Amazon RDS DB instance running MySQL. For more information, see `Restoring a backup into an Amazon RDS for MySQL DB instance <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/MySQL.Procedural.Importing.html>`__ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.*

   

  This operation doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

  :type DatabaseInsightsMode: string
  :param DatabaseInsightsMode: 

    Specifies the mode of Database Insights to enable for the DB instance.

     

    .. note::

      

      Aurora DB instances inherit this value from the DB cluster, so you can't change this value.

      

    

  
  :type EnablePerformanceInsights: boolean
  :param EnablePerformanceInsights: 

    Specifies whether to enable Performance Insights for the DB instance.

     

    For more information, see `Using Amazon Performance Insights <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_PerfInsights.html>`__ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.

    For example, the following values are valid:

     

    
    * 93 (3 months * 31)
     
    * 341 (11 months * 31)
     
    * 589 (19 months * 31)
     
    * 731
    

     

    If you specify a retention period such as 94, which isn't a valid value, RDS issues an error.

    

  
  :type EnableCloudwatchLogsExports: list
  :param EnableCloudwatchLogsExports: 

    The list of logs that the restored DB instance is to export to CloudWatch Logs. The values in the list depend on the DB engine being used.

      Contains the processor features of a DB instance class.

       

      To specify the number of CPU cores, use the ``coreCount`` feature name for the ``Name`` parameter. To specify the number of threads per core, use the ``threadsPerCore`` feature name for the ``Name`` parameter.

       

      You can set the processor features of the DB instance class for a DB instance when you call one of the following actions:

       

      
      * ``CreateDBInstance``
       
      * ``ModifyDBInstance``
       
      * ``RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot``
       
      * ``RestoreDBInstanceFromS3``
       
      * ``RestoreDBInstanceToPointInTime``
      

       

      You can view the valid processor values for a particular instance class by calling the ``DescribeOrderableDBInstanceOptions`` action and specifying the instance class for the ``DBInstanceClass`` parameter.

       

      In addition, you can use the following actions for DB instance class processor information:

       

      
      * ``DescribeDBInstances``
       
      * ``DescribeDBSnapshots``
       
      * ``DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications``
      

       

      If you call ``DescribeDBInstances``, ``ProcessorFeature`` returns non-null values only if the following conditions are met:

       

      
      * You are accessing an Oracle or SQL Server DB instance.
       
      * Your Oracle or SQL Server DB instance class supports configuring the number of CPU cores and threads per core.

      - **Name** *(string) --* 

        The name of the processor feature. Valid names are ``coreCount`` and ``threadsPerCore``.

        

      
      - **Value** *(string) --* 

        The value of a processor feature.

        

      
    

  :type UseDefaultProcessorFeatures: boolean
  :param UseDefaultProcessorFeatures: 

    Specifies whether the DB instance class of the DB instance uses its default processor features.

    

  
  :type DeletionProtection: boolean
  :param DeletionProtection: 

    Specifies whether to enable deletion protection for the DB instance. The database can't be deleted when deletion protection is enabled. By default, deletion protection isn't enabled. For more information, see `Deleting a DB Instance <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_DeleteInstance.html>`__.

    

  
  :type MaxAllocatedStorage: integer
  :param MaxAllocatedStorage: 

    The upper limit in gibibytes (GiB) to which Amazon RDS can automatically scale the storage of the DB instance.

     

    For more information about this setting, including limitations that apply to it, see `Managing capacity automatically with Amazon RDS storage autoscaling <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_PIOPS.StorageTypes.html#USER_PIOPS.Autoscaling>`__ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.

    

  
  :type NetworkType: string
  :param NetworkType: 

    The network type of the DB instance.

     

    Valid Values:

     

    
    * ``IPV4``
     
    * ``DUAL``
    

     

    The network type is determined by the ``DBSubnetGroup`` specified for the DB instance. A ``DBSubnetGroup`` can support only the IPv4 protocol or the IPv4 and the IPv6 protocols ( ``DUAL``).

     

    For more information, see `Working with a DB instance in a VPC <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_VPC.WorkingWithRDSInstanceinaVPC.html>`__ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.*

    

  
  :type ManageMasterUserPassword: boolean
  :param ManageMasterUserPassword: 

    Specifies whether to manage the master user password with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager.

     

    For more information, see `Password management with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-secrets-manager.html>`__ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.*

     

    Constraints:

     

    
    * Can't manage the master user password with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager if ``MasterUserPassword`` is specified.
    

    

  
  :type MasterUserSecretKmsKeyId: string
  :param MasterUserSecretKmsKeyId: 

    The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier to encrypt a secret that is automatically generated and managed in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager.

     

    This setting is valid only if the master user password is managed by RDS in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager for the DB instance.

     

    The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key. To use a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account, specify the key ARN or alias ARN.

     

    If you don't specify ``MasterUserSecretKmsKeyId``, then the ``aws/secretsmanager`` KMS key is used to encrypt the secret. If the secret is in a different Amazon Web Services account, then you can't use the ``aws/secretsmanager`` KMS key to encrypt the secret, and you must use a customer managed KMS key.

     

    There is a default KMS key for your Amazon Web Services account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a different default KMS key for each Amazon Web Services Region.

    

  
  :type DedicatedLogVolume: boolean
  :param DedicatedLogVolume: 

    Specifies whether to enable a dedicated log volume (DLV) for the DB instance.

    

  
  :type CACertificateIdentifier: string
  :param CACertificateIdentifier: 

    The CA certificate identifier to use for the DB instance's server certificate.

     

    This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

     

    For more information, see `Using SSL/TLS to encrypt a connection to a DB instance <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html>`__ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide* and `Using SSL/TLS to encrypt a connection to a DB cluster <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html>`__ in the *Amazon Aurora User Guide*.

    

  
  :type EngineLifecycleSupport: string
  :param EngineLifecycleSupport: 

    The life cycle type for this DB instance.

     

    .. note::

      

      By default, this value is set to ``open-source-rds-extended-support``, which enrolls your DB instance into Amazon RDS Extended Support. At the end of standard support, you can avoid charges for Extended Support by setting the value to ``open-source-rds-extended-support-disabled``. In this case, RDS automatically upgrades your restored DB instance to a higher engine version, if the major engine version is past its end of standard support date.

      

     

    You can use this setting to enroll your DB instance into Amazon RDS Extended Support. With RDS Extended Support, you can run the selected major engine version on your DB instance past the end of standard support for that engine version. For more information, see `Amazon RDS Extended Support Amazon RDS <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/extended-support.html>`__ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.

     

    This setting applies only to RDS for MySQL and RDS for PostgreSQL. For Amazon Aurora DB instances, the life cycle type is managed by the DB cluster.

     

    Valid Values: ``open-source-rds-extended-support | open-source-rds-extended-support-disabled``

     

    Default: ``open-source-rds-extended-support``

            - *(dict) --* 

              Contains the processor features of a DB instance class.

               

              To specify the number of CPU cores, use the ``coreCount`` feature name for the ``Name`` parameter. To specify the number of threads per core, use the ``threadsPerCore`` feature name for the ``Name`` parameter.

               

              You can set the processor features of the DB instance class for a DB instance when you call one of the following actions:

               

              
              * ``CreateDBInstance``
               
              * ``ModifyDBInstance``
               
              * ``RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot``
               
              * ``RestoreDBInstanceFromS3``
               
              * ``RestoreDBInstanceToPointInTime``
              

               

              You can view the valid processor values for a particular instance class by calling the ``DescribeOrderableDBInstanceOptions`` action and specifying the instance class for the ``DBInstanceClass`` parameter.

               

              In addition, you can use the following actions for DB instance class processor information:

               

              
              * ``DescribeDBInstances``
               
              * ``DescribeDBSnapshots``
               
              * ``DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications``
              

               

              If you call ``DescribeDBInstances``, ``ProcessorFeature`` returns non-null values only if the following conditions are met:

               

              
              * You are accessing an Oracle or SQL Server DB instance.
               
              * Your Oracle or SQL Server DB instance class supports configuring the number of CPU cores and threads per core.
               
              * The current number CPU cores and threads is set to a non-default value.

When you connect from within the same VPC as the DB instance, the endpoint resolves to the private IP address. Access to the DB cluster is ultimately controlled by the security group it uses. That public access isn't permitted if the security group assigned to the DB cluster doesn't permit it.

           

          When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB instance with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address.

          - *(dict) --* 

            Contains the processor features of a DB instance class.

             

            To specify the number of CPU cores, use the ``coreCount`` feature name for the ``Name`` parameter. To specify the number of threads per core, use the ``threadsPerCore`` feature name for the ``Name`` parameter.

             

            You can set the processor features of the DB instance class for a DB instance when you call one of the following actions:

             

            
            * ``CreateDBInstance``
             
            * ``ModifyDBInstance``

            * ``RestoreDBInstanceToPointInTime``
            

             

            You can view the valid processor values for a particular instance class by calling the ``DescribeOrderableDBInstanceOptions`` action and specifying the instance class for the ``DBInstanceClass`` parameter.

             

            In addition, you can use the following actions for DB instance class processor information:

             

            
            * ``DescribeDBInstances``
             
            * ``DescribeDBSnapshots``
             
            * ``DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications``
            

             

            If you call ``DescribeDBInstances``, ``ProcessorFeature`` returns non-null values only if the following conditions are met:

             

            
            * You are accessing an Oracle or SQL Server DB instance.
             
            * Your Oracle or SQL Server DB instance class supports configuring the number of CPU cores and threads per core.
             
            * The current number CPU cores and threads is set to a non-default value.
