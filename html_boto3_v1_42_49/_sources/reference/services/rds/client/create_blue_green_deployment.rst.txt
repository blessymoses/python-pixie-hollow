.. py:method:: RDS.Client.create_blue_green_deployment(**kwargs)

  

  Creates a blue/green deployment.

   

  A blue/green deployment creates a staging environment that copies the production environment. In a blue/green deployment, the blue environment is the current production environment. The green environment is the staging environment, and it stays in sync with the current production environment.

   

  You can make changes to the databases in the green environment without affecting production workloads. For example, you can upgrade the major or minor DB engine version, change database parameters, or make schema changes in the staging environment. You can thoroughly test changes in the green environment. When ready, you can switch over the environments to promote the green environment to be the new production environment. The switchover typically takes under a minute.

  :type BlueGreenDeploymentName: string
  :param BlueGreenDeploymentName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of the blue/green deployment.

     

    Constraints:

     

    
    * Can't be the same as an existing blue/green deployment name in the same account and Amazon Web Services Region.
    

    

  
  :type Source: string
  :param Source: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the source production database.

     

    Specify the database that you want to clone. The blue/green deployment creates this database in the green environment. You can make updates to the database in the green environment, such as an engine version upgrade. When you are ready, you can switch the database in the green environment to be the production database.

    

  
  :type TargetEngineVersion: string
  :param TargetEngineVersion: 

    The engine version of the database in the green environment.

     

    Specify the engine version to upgrade to in the green environment.

    

  
  :type TargetDBParameterGroupName: string
  :param TargetDBParameterGroupName: 

    The DB parameter group associated with the DB instance in the green environment.

     

    To test parameter changes, specify a DB parameter group that is different from the one associated with the source DB instance.

    

  
  :type TargetDBClusterParameterGroupName: string
  :param TargetDBClusterParameterGroupName: 

    The DB cluster parameter group associated with the Aurora DB cluster in the green environment.

     

    To test parameter changes, specify a DB cluster parameter group that is different from the one associated with the source DB cluster.

    

  
  :type Tags: list
  :param Tags: 

    Tags to assign to the blue/green deployment.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      Metadata assigned to an Amazon RDS resource consisting of a key-value pair.

       

      For more information, see `Tagging Amazon RDS resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_Tagging.html>`__ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide* or `Tagging Amazon Aurora and Amazon RDS resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_Tagging.html>`__ in the *Amazon Aurora User Guide*.

      

    
      - **Key** *(string) --* 

        A key is the required name of the tag. The string value can be from 1 to 128 Unicode characters in length and can't be prefixed with ``aws:`` or ``rds:``. The string can only contain only the set of Unicode letters, digits, white-space, '_', '.', ':', '/', '=', '+', '-', '@' (Java regex: "^([\\p{L}\\p{Z}\\p{N}_.:/=+\\-@]*)$").

        

      
      - **Value** *(string) --* 

        A value is the optional value of the tag. The string value can be from 1 to 256 Unicode characters in length and can't be prefixed with ``aws:`` or ``rds:``. The string can only contain only the set of Unicode letters, digits, white-space, '_', '.', ':', '/', '=', '+', '-', '@' (Java regex: "^([\\p{L}\\p{Z}\\p{N}_.:/=+\\-@]*)$").

        

      
    

  :type TargetDBInstanceClass: string
  :param TargetDBInstanceClass: 

    Specify the DB instance class for the databases in the green environment.

     

    This parameter only applies to RDS DB instances, because DB instances within an Aurora DB cluster can have multiple different instance classes. If you're creating a blue/green deployment from an Aurora DB cluster, don't specify this parameter. After the green environment is created, you can individually modify the instance classes of the DB instances within the green DB cluster.

    

  
  :type UpgradeTargetStorageConfig: boolean
  :param UpgradeTargetStorageConfig: 

    Whether to upgrade the storage file system configuration on the green database. This option migrates the green DB instance from the older 32-bit file system to the preferred configuration. For more information, see `Upgrading the storage file system for a DB instance <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_PIOPS.StorageTypes.html#USER_PIOPS.UpgradeFileSystem>`__.

    

  
  :type TargetIops: integer
  :param TargetIops: 

    The amount of Provisioned IOPS (input/output operations per second) to allocate for the green DB instance. For information about valid IOPS values, see `Amazon RDS DB instance storage <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_Storage.html>`__ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.

     

    This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora blue/green deployments.

    

  
  :type TargetStorageType: string
  :param TargetStorageType: 

    The storage type to associate with the green DB instance.

     

    Valid Values: ``gp2 | gp3 | io1 | io2``

     

    This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora blue/green deployments.

    

  
  :type TargetAllocatedStorage: integer
  :param TargetAllocatedStorage: 

    The amount of storage in gibibytes (GiB) to allocate for the green DB instance. You can choose to increase or decrease the allocated storage on the green DB instance.

     

    This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora blue/green deployments.

    

  
  :type TargetStorageThroughput: integer
  :param TargetStorageThroughput: 

    The storage throughput value for the green DB instance.

     

    This setting applies only to the ``gp3`` storage type.

     

    This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora blue/green deployments.
