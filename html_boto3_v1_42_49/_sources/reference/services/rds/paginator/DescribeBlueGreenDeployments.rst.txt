    :type BlueGreenDeploymentIdentifier: string
    :param BlueGreenDeploymentIdentifier: 

      The blue/green deployment identifier. If you specify this parameter, the response only includes information about the specific blue/green deployment. This parameter isn't case-sensitive.

       

      Constraints:

       

      
      * Must match an existing blue/green deployment identifier.
      

      

    
    :type Filters: list
    :param Filters: 

      A filter that specifies one or more blue/green deployments to describe.

       

      Valid Values:

       

      
      * ``blue-green-deployment-identifier`` - Accepts system-generated identifiers for blue/green deployments. The results list only includes information about the blue/green deployments with the specified identifiers.

      * ``source`` - Accepts source databases for a blue/green deployment. The results list only includes information about the blue/green deployments with the specified source databases.
       
      * ``target`` - Accepts target databases for a blue/green deployment. The results list only includes information about the blue/green deployments with the specified target databases.
      

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more specific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be used to match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as IDs. The filters supported by a describe operation are documented with the describe operation.

         

        .. note::

          

          Currently, wildcards are not supported in filters.
