.. py:method:: Snowball.Client.create_job(**kwargs)

  

  Creates a job to import or export data between Amazon S3 and your on-premises data center. Your Amazon Web Services account must have the right trust policies and permissions in place to create a job for a Snow device. If you're creating a job for a node in a cluster, you only need to provide the ``clusterId`` value; the other job attributes are inherited from the cluster.

   

  .. note::

    

    Only the Snowball; Edge device type is supported when ordering clustered jobs.

     

    The device capacity is optional.

     

    Availability of device types differ by Amazon Web Services Region. For more information about Region availability, see `Amazon Web Services Regional Services <https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/?p=ngi&loc=4>`__.

    Allows you to securely operate and manage Snowcone devices remotely from outside of your internal network. When set to ``INSTALLED_AUTOSTART``, remote management will automatically be available when the device arrives at your location. Otherwise, you need to use the Snowball Edge client to manage the device. When set to ``NOT_INSTALLED``, remote management will not be available on the device.

  **Examples**

  Creates a job to import or export data between Amazon S3 and your on-premises data center. Your AWS account must have the right trust policies and permissions in place to create a job for Snowball. If you're creating a job for a node in a cluster, you only need to provide the clusterId value; the other job attributes are inherited from the cluster.
