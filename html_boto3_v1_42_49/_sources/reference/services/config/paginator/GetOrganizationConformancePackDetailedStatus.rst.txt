    :type OrganizationConformancePackName: string
    :param OrganizationConformancePackName: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The name of organization conformance pack for which you want status details for member accounts.

      

    
    :type Filters: dict
    :param Filters: 

      An ``OrganizationResourceDetailedStatusFilters`` object.

      

    
      - **AccountId** *(string) --* 

        The 12-digit account ID of the member account within an organization.

        

      
      - **Status** *(string) --* 

        Indicates deployment status for conformance pack in a member account. When management account calls ``PutOrganizationConformancePack`` action for the first time, conformance pack status is created in the member account. When management account calls ``PutOrganizationConformancePack`` action for the second time, conformance pack status is updated in the member account. Conformance pack status is deleted when the management account deletes ``OrganizationConformancePack`` and disables service access for ``config-multiaccountsetup.amazonaws.com``.

         

        Config sets the state of the conformance pack to:

         

        
        * ``CREATE_SUCCESSFUL`` when conformance pack has been created in the member account.
         
        * ``CREATE_IN_PROGRESS`` when conformance pack is being created in the member account.
         
        * ``CREATE_FAILED`` when conformance pack creation has failed in the member account.
         
        * ``DELETE_FAILED`` when conformance pack deletion has failed in the member account.
         
        * ``DELETE_IN_PROGRESS`` when conformance pack is being deleted in the member account.
         
        * ``DELETE_SUCCESSFUL`` when conformance pack has been deleted in the member account.
         
        * ``UPDATE_SUCCESSFUL`` when conformance pack has been updated in the member account.
         
        * ``UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS`` when conformance pack is being updated in the member account.
         
        * ``UPDATE_FAILED`` when conformance pack deletion has failed in the member account.
        

        

      
    
    :type PaginationConfig: dict
    :param PaginationConfig: 

      A dictionary that provides parameters to control pagination.

      

    
      - **MaxItems** *(integer) --* 

        The total number of items to return. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified in max-items then a ``NextToken`` will be provided in the output that you can use to resume pagination.

        

      
      - **PageSize** *(integer) --* 

        The size of each page.

        

      
      - **StartingToken** *(string) --* 

        A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previous response.
