        },

        NextToken='string'
    )
    
  :type OrganizationConfigRuleName: string
  :param OrganizationConfigRuleName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of your organization Config rule for which you want status details for member accounts.

    

  
  :type Filters: dict
  :param Filters: 

    A ``StatusDetailFilters`` object.

    

  
    - **AccountId** *(string) --* 

      The 12-digit account ID of the member account within an organization.

      

    
    - **MemberAccountRuleStatus** *(string) --* 

      Indicates deployment status for Config rule in the member account. When management account calls ``PutOrganizationConfigRule`` action for the first time, Config rule status is created in the member account. When management account calls ``PutOrganizationConfigRule`` action for the second time, Config rule status is updated in the member account. Config rule status is deleted when the management account deletes ``OrganizationConfigRule`` and disables service access for ``config-multiaccountsetup.amazonaws.com``.

       

      Config sets the state of the rule to:

       

      
      * ``CREATE_SUCCESSFUL`` when Config rule has been created in the member account.
       
      * ``CREATE_IN_PROGRESS`` when Config rule is being created in the member account.
       
      * ``CREATE_FAILED`` when Config rule creation has failed in the member account.
       
      * ``DELETE_FAILED`` when Config rule deletion has failed in the member account.
       
      * ``DELETE_IN_PROGRESS`` when Config rule is being deleted in the member account.
       
      * ``DELETE_SUCCESSFUL`` when Config rule has been deleted in the member account.
       
      * ``UPDATE_SUCCESSFUL`` when Config rule has been updated in the member account.
       
      * ``UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS`` when Config rule is being updated in the member account.
       
      * ``UPDATE_FAILED`` when Config rule deletion has failed in the member account.
      

      

    
  
  :type Limit: integer
  :param Limit: 

    The maximum number of ``OrganizationConfigRuleDetailedStatus`` returned on each page. If you do not specify a number, Config uses the default. The default is 100.

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    The ``nextToken`` string returned on a previous page that you use to get the next page of results in a paginated response.
