.. py:method:: ConfigService.Client.delete_conformance_pack(**kwargs)

  

  Deletes the specified conformance pack and all the Config rules, remediation actions, and all evaluation results within that conformance pack.

   

  Config sets the conformance pack to ``DELETE_IN_PROGRESS`` until the deletion is complete. You cannot update a conformance pack while it is in this state.

   

  .. note::

    

    Recommendation: Consider excluding the ``AWS::Config::ResourceCompliance`` resource type from recording before deleting rules

     

    Deleting rules creates configuration items (CIs) for ``AWS::Config::ResourceCompliance`` that can affect your costs for the configuration recorder. If you are deleting rules which evaluate a large number of resource types, this can lead to a spike in the number of CIs recorded.

     

    To avoid the associated costs, you can opt to disable recording for the ``AWS::Config::ResourceCompliance`` resource type before deleting rules, and re-enable recording after the rules have been deleted.

     

    However, since deleting rules is an asynchronous process, it might take an hour or more to complete. During the time when recording is disabled for ``AWS::Config::ResourceCompliance``, rule evaluations will not be recorded in the associated resource’s history.
