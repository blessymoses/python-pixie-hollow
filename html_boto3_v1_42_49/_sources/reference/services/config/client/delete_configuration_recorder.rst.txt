.. py:method:: ConfigService.Client.delete_configuration_recorder(**kwargs)

  

  Deletes the customer managed configuration recorder.

You will be able to access the previously recorded information by using the `GetResourceConfigHistory <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/APIReference/API_GetResourceConfigHistory.html>`__ operation, but you will not be able to access this information in the Config console until you have created a new customer managed configuration recorder.
