.. py:method:: ConfigService.Client.describe_compliance_by_resource(**kwargs)

  

  Indicates whether the specified Amazon Web Services resources are compliant. If a resource is noncompliant, this operation returns the number of Config rules that the resource does not comply with.

   

  A resource is compliant if it complies with all the Config rules that evaluate it. It is noncompliant if it does not comply with one or more of these rules.

   

  If Config has no current evaluation results for the resource, it returns ``INSUFFICIENT_DATA``. This result might indicate one of the following conditions about the rules that evaluate the resource:

   

  
  * Config has never invoked an evaluation for the rule. To check whether it has, use the ``DescribeConfigRuleEvaluationStatus`` action to get the ``LastSuccessfulInvocationTime`` and ``LastFailedInvocationTime``.
   
  * The rule's Lambda function is failing to send evaluation results to Config. Verify that the role that you assigned to your configuration recorder includes the ``config:PutEvaluations`` permission. If the rule is a custom rule, verify that the Lambda execution role includes the ``config:PutEvaluations`` permission.
   
  * The rule's Lambda function has returned ``NOT_APPLICABLE`` for all evaluation results. This can occur if the resources were deleted or removed from the rule's scope.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.describe_compliance_by_resource(
        ResourceType='string',
        ResourceId='string',
        ComplianceTypes=[
            'COMPLIANT'|'NON_COMPLIANT'|'NOT_APPLICABLE'|'INSUFFICIENT_DATA',
        ],
        Limit=123,
        NextToken='string'
    )
    
  :type ResourceType: string
  :param ResourceType: 

    The types of Amazon Web Services resources for which you want compliance information (for example, ``AWS::EC2::Instance``). For this operation, you can specify that the resource type is an Amazon Web Services account by specifying ``AWS::::Account``.

    

  
  :type ResourceId: string
  :param ResourceId: 

    The ID of the Amazon Web Services resource for which you want compliance information. You can specify only one resource ID. If you specify a resource ID, you must also specify a type for ``ResourceType``.

    

  
  :type ComplianceTypes: list
  :param ComplianceTypes: 

    Filters the results by compliance.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type Limit: integer
  :param Limit: 

    The maximum number of evaluation results returned on each page. The default is 10. You cannot specify a number greater than 100. If you specify 0, Config uses the default.

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    The ``nextToken`` string returned on a previous page that you use to get the next page of results in a paginated response.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **ComplianceByResources** *(list) --* 

        Indicates whether the specified Amazon Web Services resource complies with all of the Config rules that evaluate it.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          Indicates whether an Amazon Web Services resource that is evaluated according to one or more Config rules is compliant. A resource is compliant if it complies with all of the rules that evaluate it. A resource is noncompliant if it does not comply with one or more of these rules.

          
          

          - **ResourceType** *(string) --* 

            The type of the Amazon Web Services resource that was evaluated.

            
          

          - **ResourceId** *(string) --* 

            The ID of the Amazon Web Services resource that was evaluated.

            
          

          - **Compliance** *(dict) --* 

            Indicates whether the Amazon Web Services resource complies with all of the Config rules that evaluated it.

            
            

            - **ComplianceType** *(string) --* 

              Indicates whether an Amazon Web Services resource or Config rule is compliant.

               

              A resource is compliant if it complies with all of the Config rules that evaluate it. A resource is noncompliant if it does not comply with one or more of these rules.

               

              A rule is compliant if all of the resources that the rule evaluates comply with it. A rule is noncompliant if any of these resources do not comply.

               

              Config returns the ``INSUFFICIENT_DATA`` value when no evaluation results are available for the Amazon Web Services resource or Config rule.

               

              For the ``Compliance`` data type, Config supports only ``COMPLIANT``, ``NON_COMPLIANT``, and ``INSUFFICIENT_DATA`` values. Config does not support the ``NOT_APPLICABLE`` value for the ``Compliance`` data type.

              
            

            - **ComplianceContributorCount** *(dict) --* 

              The number of Amazon Web Services resources or Config rules that cause a result of ``NON_COMPLIANT``, up to a maximum number.

              
              

              - **CappedCount** *(integer) --* 

                The number of Amazon Web Services resources or Config rules responsible for the current compliance of the item.
