.. py:method:: ConfigService.Client.delete_organization_conformance_pack(**kwargs)

  

  Deletes the specified organization conformance pack and all of the Config rules and remediation actions from all member accounts in that organization.

   

  Only a management account or a delegated administrator account can delete an organization conformance pack. When calling this API with a delegated administrator, you must ensure Organizations ``ListDelegatedAdministrator`` permissions are added.

   

  Config sets the state of a conformance pack to DELETE_IN_PROGRESS until the deletion is complete. You cannot update a conformance pack while it is in this state.

   

  .. note::

    

    Recommendation: Consider excluding the ``AWS::Config::ResourceCompliance`` resource type from recording before deleting rules

     

    Deleting rules creates configuration items (CIs) for ``AWS::Config::ResourceCompliance`` that can affect your costs for the configuration recorder. If you are deleting rules which evaluate a large number of resource types, this can lead to a spike in the number of CIs recorded.

     

    To avoid the associated costs, you can opt to disable recording for the ``AWS::Config::ResourceCompliance`` resource type before deleting rules, and re-enable recording after the rules have been deleted.

     

    However, since deleting rules is an asynchronous process, it might take an hour or more to complete. During the time when recording is disabled for ``AWS::Config::ResourceCompliance``, rule evaluations will not be recorded in the associated resource’s history.
