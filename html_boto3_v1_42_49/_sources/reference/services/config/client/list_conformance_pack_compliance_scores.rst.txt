.. py:method:: ConfigService.Client.list_conformance_pack_compliance_scores(**kwargs)

  

  Returns a list of conformance pack compliance scores. A compliance score is the percentage of the number of compliant rule-resource combinations in a conformance pack compared to the number of total possible rule-resource combinations in the conformance pack. This metric provides you with a high-level view of the compliance state of your conformance packs. You can use it to identify, investigate, and understand the level of compliance in your conformance packs.

   

  .. note::

    

    Conformance packs with no evaluation results will have a compliance score of ``INSUFFICIENT_DATA``.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_conformance_pack_compliance_scores(
        Filters={
            'ConformancePackNames': [
                'string',
            ]
        },
        SortOrder='ASCENDING'|'DESCENDING',
        SortBy='SCORE',
        Limit=123,
        NextToken='string'
    )
    
  :type Filters: dict
  :param Filters: 

    Filters the results based on the ``ConformancePackComplianceScoresFilters``.

    

  
    - **ConformancePackNames** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The names of the conformance packs whose compliance scores you want to include in the conformance pack compliance score result set. You can include up to 25 conformance packs in the ``ConformancePackNames`` array of strings, each with a character limit of 256 characters for the conformance pack name.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
  
  :type SortOrder: string
  :param SortOrder: 

    Determines the order in which conformance pack compliance scores are sorted. Either in ascending or descending order.

     

    By default, conformance pack compliance scores are sorted in alphabetical order by name of the conformance pack. Conformance pack compliance scores are sorted in reverse alphabetical order if you enter ``DESCENDING``.

     

    You can sort conformance pack compliance scores by the numerical value of the compliance score by entering ``SCORE`` in the ``SortBy`` action. When compliance scores are sorted by ``SCORE``, conformance packs with a compliance score of ``INSUFFICIENT_DATA`` will be last when sorting by ascending order and first when sorting by descending order.

    

  
  :type SortBy: string
  :param SortBy: 

    Sorts your conformance pack compliance scores in either ascending or descending order, depending on ``SortOrder``.

     

    By default, conformance pack compliance scores are sorted in alphabetical order by name of the conformance pack. Enter ``SCORE``, to sort conformance pack compliance scores by the numerical value of the compliance score.

    

  
  :type Limit: integer
  :param Limit: 

    The maximum number of conformance pack compliance scores returned on each page.

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    The ``nextToken`` string in a prior request that you can use to get the paginated response for the next set of conformance pack compliance scores.
