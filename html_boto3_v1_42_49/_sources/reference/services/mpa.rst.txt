Client

.. py:class:: MultipartyApproval.Client

  A low-level client representing AWS Multi-party Approval
  

  Multi-party approval is a capability of `Organizations <http://aws.amazon.com/organizations>`__ that allows you to protect a predefined list of operations through a distributed approval process. Use Multi-party approval to establish approval workflows and transform security processes into team-based decisions.

   

  **When to use Multi-party approval**:

   

  
  * You need to align with the Zero Trust principle of "never trust, always verify"
   
  * You need to make sure that the right humans have access to the right things in the right way
   
  * You need distributed decision-making for sensitive or critical operations
   
  * You need to protect against unintended operations on sensitive or critical resources
   
  * You need formal reviews and approvals for auditing or compliance reasons
  

   

  For more information, see `What is Multi-party approval <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mpa/latest/userguide/what-is.html>`__ in the *Multi-party approval User Guide*.
