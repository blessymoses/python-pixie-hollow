    * Letters a through z. Domain names are not case sensitive.
     
    * Numbers 0 through 9.
     
    * Hyphen (-). You can't specify a hyphen at the beginning or end of a label.
     
    * Period (.) to separate the labels in the name, such as the ``.`` in ``example.com``.
    

    

  
  :type AuthCode: string
  :param AuthCode:
