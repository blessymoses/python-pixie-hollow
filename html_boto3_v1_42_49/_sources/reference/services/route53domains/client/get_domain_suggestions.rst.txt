  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.get_domain_suggestions(
        DomainName='string',
        SuggestionCount=123,
        OnlyAvailable=True|False
    )
    
  :type DomainName: string
  :param DomainName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A domain name that you want to use as the basis for a list of possible domain names. The top-level domain (TLD), such as .com, must be a TLD that Route 53 supports. For a list of supported TLDs, see `Domains that You Can Register with Amazon Route 53 <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/registrar-tld-list.html>`__ in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide*.

     

    The domain name can contain only the following characters:

     

    
    * Letters a through z. Domain names are not case sensitive.
     
    * Numbers 0 through 9.
     
    * Hyphen (-). You can't specify a hyphen at the beginning or end of a label.
     
    * Period (.) to separate the labels in the name, such as the ``.`` in ``example.com``.
    

     

    Internationalized domain names are not supported for some top-level domains. To determine whether the TLD that you want to use supports internationalized domain names, see `Domains that You Can Register with Amazon Route 53 <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/registrar-tld-list.html>`__.

    

  
  :type SuggestionCount: integer
  :param SuggestionCount: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The number of suggested domain names that you want Route 53 to return. Specify a value between 1 and 50.

    

  
  :type OnlyAvailable: boolean
  :param OnlyAvailable: **[REQUIRED]** 

    If ``OnlyAvailable`` is ``true``, Route 53 returns only domain names that are available. If ``OnlyAvailable`` is ``false``, Route 53 returns domain names without checking whether they're available to be registered. To determine whether the domain is available, you can call ``checkDomainAvailability`` for each suggestion.

    ::

      {

              {

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **SuggestionsList** *(list) --* 

        A list of possible domain names. If you specified ``true`` for ``OnlyAvailable`` in the request, the list contains only domains that are available for registration.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          Information about one suggested domain name.

          
          

          - **DomainName** *(string) --* 

            A suggested domain name.

            
          

          - **Availability** *(string) --* 

            Whether the domain name is available for registering.

             

            .. note::

              

              You can register only the domains that are designated as ``AVAILABLE``.

              

             

            Valid values:

              AVAILABLE  

            The domain name is available.

              AVAILABLE_RESERVED  

            The domain name is reserved under specific conditions.

              AVAILABLE_PREORDER  

            The domain name is available and can be preordered.

              DONT_KNOW  

            The TLD registry didn't reply with a definitive answer about whether the domain name is available. Route 53 can return this response for a variety of reasons, for example, the registry is performing maintenance. Try again later.

              PENDING  

            The TLD registry didn't return a response in the expected amount of time. When the response is delayed, it usually takes just a few extra seconds. You can resubmit the request immediately.

              RESERVED  

            The domain name has been reserved for another person or organization.

              UNAVAILABLE  

            The domain name is not available.

              UNAVAILABLE_PREMIUM  

            The domain name is not available.

              UNAVAILABLE_RESTRICTED  

            The domain name is forbidden.
