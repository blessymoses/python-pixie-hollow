.. py:method:: CognitoIdentityProvider.Client.set_user_pool_mfa_config(**kwargs)

  

  Sets user pool multi-factor authentication (MFA) and passkey configuration. For more information about user pool MFA, see `Adding MFA <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-mfa.html>`__. For more information about WebAuthn passkeys see `Authentication flows <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/amazon-cognito-user-pools-authentication-flow-methods.html#amazon-cognito-user-pools-authentication-flow-methods-passkey>`__.

   

  .. note::

    

    This action might generate an SMS text message. Starting June 1, 2021, US telecom carriers require you to register an origination phone number before you can send SMS messages to US phone numbers. If you use SMS text messages in Amazon Cognito, you must register a phone number with `Amazon Pinpoint <https://console.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/home/>`__. Amazon Cognito uses the registered number automatically. Otherwise, Amazon Cognito users who must receive SMS messages might not be able to sign up, activate their accounts, or sign in.

     

    If you have never used SMS text messages with Amazon Cognito or any other Amazon Web Services service, Amazon Simple Notification Service might place your account in the SMS sandbox. In `sandbox mode <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-sms-sandbox.html>`__ , you can send messages only to verified phone numbers. After you test your app while in the sandbox environment, you can move out of the sandbox and into production. For more information, see `SMS message settings for Amazon Cognito user pools <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-sms-settings.html>`__ in the *Amazon Cognito Developer Guide*.

    )
    
  :type UserPoolId: string
  :param UserPoolId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The user pool ID.

    

  
  :type SmsMfaConfiguration: dict
  :param SmsMfaConfiguration: 

    Configures user pool SMS messages for MFA. Sets the message template and the SMS message sending configuration for Amazon SNS.

    

  
    - **SmsAuthenticationMessage** *(string) --* 

      The SMS authentication message that will be sent to users with the code they must sign in with. The message must contain the ``{####}`` placeholder. Your user pool replaces the placeholder with the MFA code. If this parameter isn't provided, your user pool sends a default message.

      

    
    - **SmsConfiguration** *(dict) --* 

      User pool configuration for delivery of SMS messages with Amazon Simple Notification Service. To send SMS messages with Amazon SNS in the Amazon Web Services Region that you want, the Amazon Cognito user pool uses an Identity and Access Management (IAM) role in your Amazon Web Services account.

       

      You can set ``SmsConfiguration`` in ``CreateUserPool`` and ``UpdateUserPool``, or in ``SetUserPoolMfaConfig``.

      

    
      - **SnsCallerArn** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon SNS caller. This is the ARN of the IAM role in your Amazon Web Services account that Amazon Cognito will use to send SMS messages. SMS messages are subject to a `spending limit <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-email-phone-verification.html>`__.

        

      
      - **ExternalId** *(string) --* 

        The external ID provides additional security for your IAM role. You can use an ``ExternalId`` with the IAM role that you use with Amazon SNS to send SMS messages for your user pool. If you provide an ``ExternalId``, your Amazon Cognito user pool includes it in the request to assume your IAM role. You can configure the role trust policy to require that Amazon Cognito, and any principal, provide the ``ExternalID``. If you use the Amazon Cognito Management Console to create a role for SMS multi-factor authentication (MFA), Amazon Cognito creates a role with the required permissions and a trust policy that demonstrates use of the ``ExternalId``.

         

        For more information about the ``ExternalId`` of a role, see `How to use an external ID when granting access to your Amazon Web Services resources to a third party <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user_externalid.html>`__.

        

      
      - **SnsRegion** *(string) --* 

        The Amazon Web Services Region to use with Amazon SNS integration. You can choose the same Region as your user pool, or a supported **Legacy Amazon SNS alternate Region**.

         

        Amazon Cognito resources in the Asia Pacific (Seoul) Amazon Web Services Region must use your Amazon SNS configuration in the Asia Pacific (Tokyo) Region. For more information, see `SMS message settings for Amazon Cognito user pools <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-sms-settings.html>`__.

        

      
    
  
  :type SoftwareTokenMfaConfiguration: dict
  :param SoftwareTokenMfaConfiguration: 

    Configures a user pool for time-based one-time password (TOTP) MFA. Enables or disables TOTP.

    

  
    - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

      The activation state of TOTP MFA.

      

    
  
  :type EmailMfaConfiguration: dict
  :param EmailMfaConfiguration: 

    Sets configuration for user pool email message MFA and sign-in with one-time passwords (OTPs). Includes the subject and body of the email message template for sign-in and MFA messages. To activate this setting, your user pool must be in the `Essentials tier <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/feature-plans-features-essentials.html>`__ or higher.

    

  
    - **Message** *(string) --* 

      The template for the email messages that your user pool sends to users with codes for MFA and sign-in with email OTPs. The message must contain the ``{####}`` placeholder. In the message, Amazon Cognito replaces this placeholder with the code. If you don't provide this parameter, Amazon Cognito sends messages in the default format.

      

    
    - **Subject** *(string) --* 

      The subject of the email messages that your user pool sends to users with codes for MFA and email OTP sign-in.

      

    
  
  :type MfaConfiguration: string
  :param MfaConfiguration: 

    Sets multi-factor authentication (MFA) to be on, off, or optional. When ``ON``, all users must set up MFA before they can sign in. When ``OPTIONAL``, your application must make a client-side determination of whether a user wants to register an MFA device. For user pools with adaptive authentication with threat protection, choose ``OPTIONAL``.

     

    When ``MfaConfiguration`` is ``OPTIONAL``, managed login doesn't automatically prompt users to set up MFA. Amazon Cognito generates MFA prompts in API responses and in managed login for users who have chosen and configured a preferred MFA factor.

    

  
  :type WebAuthnConfiguration: dict
  :param WebAuthnConfiguration: 

    The configuration of your user pool for passkey, or WebAuthn, authentication and registration. You can set this configuration independent of the MFA configuration options in this operation.

    

  
    - **RelyingPartyId** *(string) --* 

      Sets or displays the authentication domain, typically your user pool domain, that passkey providers must use as a relying party (RP) in their configuration.

       

      Under the following conditions, the passkey relying party ID must be the fully-qualified domain name of your custom domain:

       

      
      * The user pool is configured for passkey authentication.
       
      * The user pool has a custom domain, whether or not it also has a prefix domain.
       
      * Your application performs authentication with managed login or the classic hosted UI.
      

      

    
    - **UserVerification** *(string) --* 

      When ``required``, users can only register and sign in users with passkeys that are capable of `user verification <https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#enum-userVerificationRequirement>`__. When ``preferred``, your user pool doesn't require the use of authenticators with user verification but encourages it.
