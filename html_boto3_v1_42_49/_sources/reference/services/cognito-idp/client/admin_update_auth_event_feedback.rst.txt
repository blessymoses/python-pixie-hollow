.. py:method:: CognitoIdentityProvider.Client.admin_update_auth_event_feedback(**kwargs)

  

  Provides the feedback for an authentication event generated by threat protection features. Your response indicates that you think that the event either was from a valid user or was an unwanted authentication attempt. This feedback improves the risk evaluation decision for the user pool as part of Amazon Cognito threat protection. To activate this setting, your user pool must be on the `Plus tier <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/feature-plans-features-plus.html>`__.

   

  To train the threat-protection model to recognize trusted and untrusted sign-in characteristics, configure threat protection in audit-only mode and provide a mechanism for users or administrators to submit feedback. Your feedback can tell Amazon Cognito that a risk rating was assigned at a level you don't agree with.

   

  .. note::

    

    Amazon Cognito evaluates Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies in requests for this API operation. For this operation, you must use IAM credentials to authorize requests, and you must grant yourself the corresponding IAM permission in a policy.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.admin_update_auth_event_feedback(
        UserPoolId='string',
        Username='string',
        EventId='string',
        FeedbackValue='Valid'|'Invalid'
    )
    
  :type UserPoolId: string
  :param UserPoolId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ID of the user pool where you want to submit authentication-event feedback.

    

  
  :type Username: string
  :param Username: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of the user that you want to query or modify. The value of this parameter is typically your user's username, but it can be any of their alias attributes. If ``username`` isn't an alias attribute in your user pool, this value must be the ``sub`` of a local user or the username of a user from a third-party IdP.

    

  
  :type EventId: string
  :param EventId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ID of the threat protection authentication event that you want to update.

    

  
  :type FeedbackValue: string
  :param FeedbackValue: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Your feedback to the authentication event. When you provide a ``FeedbackValue`` value of ``valid``, you tell Amazon Cognito that you trust a user session where Amazon Cognito has evaluated some level of risk. When you provide a ``FeedbackValue`` value of ``invalid``, you tell Amazon Cognito that you don't trust a user session, or you don't believe that Amazon Cognito evaluated a high-enough risk level.
