.. py:method:: CognitoIdentityProvider.Client.admin_respond_to_auth_challenge(**kwargs)

  

  Some API operations in a user pool generate a challenge, like a prompt for an MFA code, for device authentication that bypasses MFA, or for a custom authentication challenge. An ``AdminRespondToAuthChallenge`` API request provides the answer to that challenge, like a code or a secure remote password (SRP). The parameters of a response to an authentication challenge vary with the type of challenge.

   

  For more information about custom authentication challenges, see `Custom authentication challenge Lambda triggers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-lambda-challenge.html>`__.

   

  .. note::

    

    This action might generate an SMS text message. Starting June 1, 2021, US telecom carriers require you to register an origination phone number before you can send SMS messages to US phone numbers. If you use SMS text messages in Amazon Cognito, you must register a phone number with `Amazon Pinpoint <https://console.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/home/>`__. Amazon Cognito uses the registered number automatically. Otherwise, Amazon Cognito users who must receive SMS messages might not be able to sign up, activate their accounts, or sign in.

     

    If you have never used SMS text messages with Amazon Cognito or any other Amazon Web Services service, Amazon Simple Notification Service might place your account in the SMS sandbox. In `sandbox mode <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-sms-sandbox.html>`__ , you can send messages only to verified phone numbers. After you test your app while in the sandbox environment, you can move out of the sandbox and into production. For more information, see `SMS message settings for Amazon Cognito user pools <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-sms-settings.html>`__ in the *Amazon Cognito Developer Guide*.

    

   

  .. note::

    

    Amazon Cognito evaluates Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies in requests for this API operation. For this operation, you must use IAM credentials to authorize requests, and you must grant yourself the corresponding IAM permission in a policy.

  :type UserPoolId: string
  :param UserPoolId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ID of the user pool where you want to respond to an authentication challenge.

    

  
  :type ClientId: string
  :param ClientId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ID of the app client where you initiated sign-in.

    

  
  :type ChallengeName: string
  :param ChallengeName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of the challenge that you are responding to.

     

    Possible challenges include the following:

     

    .. note::

      

      All of the following challenges require ``USERNAME`` and, when the app client has a client secret, ``SECRET_HASH`` in the parameters. Include a ``DEVICE_KEY`` for device authentication.

      

     

    
    * ``WEB_AUTHN``: Respond to the challenge with the results of a successful authentication with a WebAuthn authenticator, or passkey, as ``CREDENTIAL``. Examples of WebAuthn authenticators include biometric devices and security keys.
     
    * ``PASSWORD``: Respond with the user's password as ``PASSWORD``.
     
    * ``PASSWORD_SRP``: Respond with the initial SRP secret as ``SRP_A``.
     
    * ``SELECT_CHALLENGE``: Respond with a challenge selection as ``ANSWER``. It must be one of the challenge types in the ``AvailableChallenges`` response parameter. Add the parameters of the selected challenge, for example ``USERNAME`` and ``SMS_OTP``.
     
    * ``SMS_MFA``: Respond with the code that your user pool delivered in an SMS message, as ``SMS_MFA_CODE``
     
    * ``EMAIL_MFA``: Respond with the code that your user pool delivered in an email message, as ``EMAIL_MFA_CODE``
     
    * ``EMAIL_OTP``: Respond with the code that your user pool delivered in an email message, as ``EMAIL_OTP_CODE`` .
     
    * ``SMS_OTP``: Respond with the code that your user pool delivered in an SMS message, as ``SMS_OTP_CODE``.
     
    * ``PASSWORD_VERIFIER``: Respond with the second stage of SRP secrets as ``PASSWORD_CLAIM_SIGNATURE``, ``PASSWORD_CLAIM_SECRET_BLOCK``, and ``TIMESTAMP``.
     
    * ``CUSTOM_CHALLENGE``: This is returned if your custom authentication flow determines that the user should pass another challenge before tokens are issued. The parameters of the challenge are determined by your Lambda function and issued in the ``ChallengeParameters`` of a challenge response.
     
    * ``DEVICE_SRP_AUTH``: Respond with the initial parameters of device SRP authentication. For more information, see `Signing in with a device <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/amazon-cognito-user-pools-device-tracking.html#user-pools-remembered-devices-signing-in-with-a-device>`__.
     
    * ``DEVICE_PASSWORD_VERIFIER``: Respond with ``PASSWORD_CLAIM_SIGNATURE``, ``PASSWORD_CLAIM_SECRET_BLOCK``, and ``TIMESTAMP`` after client-side SRP calculations. For more information, see `Signing in with a device <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/amazon-cognito-user-pools-device-tracking.html#user-pools-remembered-devices-signing-in-with-a-device>`__.
     
    * ``NEW_PASSWORD_REQUIRED``: For users who are required to change their passwords after successful first login. Respond to this challenge with ``NEW_PASSWORD`` and any required attributes that Amazon Cognito returned in the ``requiredAttributes`` parameter. You can also set values for attributes that aren't required by your user pool and that your app client can write. Amazon Cognito only returns this challenge for users who have temporary passwords. When you create passwordless users, you must provide values for all required attributes. 

    .. note::

      In a ``NEW_PASSWORD_REQUIRED`` challenge response, you can't modify a required attribute that already has a value. In ``AdminRespondToAuthChallenge`` or ``RespondToAuthChallenge``, set a value for any keys that Amazon Cognito returned in the ``requiredAttributes`` parameter, then use the ``AdminUpdateUserAttributes`` or ``UpdateUserAttributes`` API operation to modify the value of any additional attributes.

    
     
    * ``MFA_SETUP``: For users who are required to setup an MFA factor before they can sign in. The MFA types activated for the user pool will be listed in the challenge parameters ``MFAS_CAN_SETUP`` value. To set up time-based one-time password (TOTP) MFA, use the session returned in this challenge from ``InitiateAuth`` or ``AdminInitiateAuth`` as an input to ``AssociateSoftwareToken``. Then, use the session returned by ``VerifySoftwareToken`` as an input to ``RespondToAuthChallenge`` or ``AdminRespondToAuthChallenge`` with challenge name ``MFA_SETUP`` to complete sign-in. To set up SMS or email MFA, collect a ``phone_number`` or ``email`` attribute for the user. Then restart the authentication flow with an ``InitiateAuth`` or ``AdminInitiateAuth`` request.
    

    

  
  :type ChallengeResponses: dict
  :param ChallengeResponses: 

    The responses to the challenge that you received in the previous request. Each challenge has its own required response parameters. The following examples are partial JSON request bodies that highlight challenge-response parameters.

     

    .. warning::

       

      You must provide a SECRET_HASH parameter in all challenge responses to an app client that has a client secret. Include a ``DEVICE_KEY`` for device authentication.

       

      SELECT_CHALLENGE  

    ``"ChallengeName": "SELECT_CHALLENGE", "ChallengeResponses": { "USERNAME": "[username]", "ANSWER": "[Challenge name]"}``

     

    Available challenges are ``PASSWORD``, ``PASSWORD_SRP``, ``EMAIL_OTP``, ``SMS_OTP``, and ``WEB_AUTHN``.

     

    Complete authentication in the ``SELECT_CHALLENGE`` response for ``PASSWORD``, ``PASSWORD_SRP``, and ``WEB_AUTHN``:

     

    
    * ``"ChallengeName": "SELECT_CHALLENGE", "ChallengeResponses": { "ANSWER": "WEB_AUTHN", "USERNAME": "[username]", "CREDENTIAL": "[AuthenticationResponseJSON]"}`` See `AuthenticationResponseJSON <https://www.w3.org/TR/WebAuthn-3/#dictdef-authenticationresponsejson>`__.
     
    * ``"ChallengeName": "SELECT_CHALLENGE", "ChallengeResponses": { "ANSWER": "PASSWORD", "USERNAME": "[username]", "PASSWORD": "[password]"}``
     
    * ``"ChallengeName": "SELECT_CHALLENGE", "ChallengeResponses": { "ANSWER": "PASSWORD_SRP", "USERNAME": "[username]", "SRP_A": "[SRP_A]"}``
    

     

    For ``SMS_OTP`` and ``EMAIL_OTP``, respond with the username and answer. Your user pool will send a code for the user to submit in the next challenge response.

     

    
    * ``"ChallengeName": "SELECT_CHALLENGE", "ChallengeResponses": { "ANSWER": "SMS_OTP", "USERNAME": "[username]"}``
     
    * ``"ChallengeName": "SELECT_CHALLENGE", "ChallengeResponses": { "ANSWER": "EMAIL_OTP", "USERNAME": "[username]"}``
    

      WEB_AUTHN  

    ``"ChallengeName": "WEB_AUTHN", "ChallengeResponses": { "USERNAME": "[username]", "CREDENTIAL": "[AuthenticationResponseJSON]"}``

     

    See `AuthenticationResponseJSON <https://www.w3.org/TR/WebAuthn-3/#dictdef-authenticationresponsejson>`__.

      PASSWORD  

    ``"ChallengeName": "PASSWORD", "ChallengeResponses": { "USERNAME": "[username]", "PASSWORD": "[password]"}``

      PASSWORD_SRP  

    ``"ChallengeName": "PASSWORD_SRP", "ChallengeResponses": { "USERNAME": "[username]", "SRP_A": "[SRP_A]"}``

      SMS_OTP  

    ``"ChallengeName": "SMS_OTP", "ChallengeResponses": {"SMS_OTP_CODE": "[code]", "USERNAME": "[username]"}``

      EMAIL_OTP  

    ``"ChallengeName": "EMAIL_OTP", "ChallengeResponses": {"EMAIL_OTP_CODE": "[code]", "USERNAME": "[username]"}``

      SMS_MFA  

    ``"ChallengeName": "SMS_MFA", "ChallengeResponses": {"SMS_MFA_CODE": "[code]", "USERNAME": "[username]"}``

      PASSWORD_VERIFIER  

    This challenge response is part of the SRP flow. Amazon Cognito requires that your application respond to this challenge within a few seconds. When the response time exceeds this period, your user pool returns a ``NotAuthorizedException`` error.

     

    ``"ChallengeName": "PASSWORD_VERIFIER", "ChallengeResponses": {"PASSWORD_CLAIM_SIGNATURE": "[claim_signature]", "PASSWORD_CLAIM_SECRET_BLOCK": "[secret_block]", "TIMESTAMP": [timestamp], "USERNAME": "[username]"}``

      CUSTOM_CHALLENGE  

    ``"ChallengeName": "CUSTOM_CHALLENGE", "ChallengeResponses": {"USERNAME": "[username]", "ANSWER": "[challenge_answer]"}``

      NEW_PASSWORD_REQUIRED  

    ``"ChallengeName": "NEW_PASSWORD_REQUIRED", "ChallengeResponses": {"NEW_PASSWORD": "[new_password]", "USERNAME": "[username]"}``

     

    To set any required attributes that ``InitiateAuth`` returned in an ``requiredAttributes`` parameter, add ``"userAttributes.[attribute_name]": "[attribute_value]"``. This parameter can also set values for writable attributes that aren't required by your user pool.

     

    .. note::

      

      In a ``NEW_PASSWORD_REQUIRED`` challenge response, you can't modify a required attribute that already has a value. In ``AdminRespondToAuthChallenge`` or ``RespondToAuthChallenge``, set a value for any keys that Amazon Cognito returned in the ``requiredAttributes`` parameter, then use the ``AdminUpdateUserAttributes`` or ``UpdateUserAttributes`` API operation to modify the value of any additional attributes.

      

      SOFTWARE_TOKEN_MFA  

    ``"ChallengeName": "SOFTWARE_TOKEN_MFA", "ChallengeResponses": {"USERNAME": "[username]", "SOFTWARE_TOKEN_MFA_CODE": [authenticator_code]}``

      - *(string) --* 

      


  :type Session: string
  :param Session: 

    The session identifier that maintains the state of authentication requests and challenge responses. If an ``AdminInitiateAuth`` or ``AdminRespondToAuthChallenge`` API request results in a determination that your application must pass another challenge, Amazon Cognito returns a session with other challenge parameters. Send this session identifier, unmodified, to the next ``AdminRespondToAuthChallenge`` request.

    

  
  :type AnalyticsMetadata: dict
  :param AnalyticsMetadata: 

    Information that supports analytics outcomes with Amazon Pinpoint, including the user's endpoint ID. The endpoint ID is a destination for Amazon Pinpoint push notifications, for example a device identifier, email address, or phone number.

    

  
    - **AnalyticsEndpointId** *(string) --* 

      The endpoint ID. Information that you want to pass to Amazon Pinpoint about where to send notifications.

      

    
  
  :type ContextData: dict
  :param ContextData: 

    Contextual data about your user session like the device fingerprint, IP address, or location. Amazon Cognito threat protection evaluates the risk of an authentication event based on the context that your app generates and passes to Amazon Cognito when it makes API requests.

     

    For more information, see `Collecting data for threat protection in applications <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-viewing-threat-protection-app.html>`__.

    

  
    - **IpAddress** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The source IP address of your user's device.

      

    
    - **ServerName** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The name of your application's service endpoint.

      

    
    - **ServerPath** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The path of your application's service endpoint.

      

    
    - **HttpHeaders** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The HTTP headers from your user's authentication request.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        The HTTP header in the ``ContextData`` parameter.

        

      
        - **headerName** *(string) --* 

          The header name.

          

        
        - **headerValue** *(string) --* 

          The header value.

          

        
      
  
    - **EncodedData** *(string) --* 

      Encoded device-fingerprint details that your app collected with the Amazon Cognito context data collection library. For more information, see `Adding user device and session data to API requests <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pool-settings-adaptive-authentication.html#user-pool-settings-adaptive-authentication-device-fingerprint>`__.

      

    
  
  :type ClientMetadata: dict
  :param ClientMetadata: 

    A map of custom key-value pairs that you can provide as input for any custom workflows that this action triggers.

     

    You create custom workflows by assigning Lambda functions to user pool triggers. When you use the AdminRespondToAuthChallenge API action, Amazon Cognito invokes any functions that you have assigned to the following triggers:

     

    
    * Pre sign-up
     
    * custom message
     
    * Post authentication
     
    * User migration
     
    * Pre token generation
     
    * Define auth challenge
     
    * Create auth challenge
     
    * Verify auth challenge response
    

     

    When Amazon Cognito invokes any of these functions, it passes a JSON payload, which the function receives as input. This payload contains a ``clientMetadata`` attribute that provides the data that you assigned to the ClientMetadata parameter in your AdminRespondToAuthChallenge request. In your function code in Lambda, you can process the ``clientMetadata`` value to enhance your workflow for your specific needs.

     

    For more information, see `Using Lambda triggers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools-working-with-aws-lambda-triggers.html>`__ in the *Amazon Cognito Developer Guide*.

     

    .. note::

      

      When you use the ``ClientMetadata`` parameter, note that Amazon Cognito won't do the following:

       

      
      * Store the ``ClientMetadata`` value. This data is available only to Lambda triggers that are assigned to a user pool to support custom workflows. If your user pool configuration doesn't include triggers, the ``ClientMetadata`` parameter serves no purpose.
       
      * Validate the ``ClientMetadata`` value.
       
      * Encrypt the ``ClientMetadata`` value. Don't send sensitive information in this parameter.

        Possible challenges include the following:

         

        .. note::

          

          All of the following challenges require ``USERNAME`` and, when the app client has a client secret, ``SECRET_HASH`` in the parameters. Include a ``DEVICE_KEY`` for device authentication.

          

         

        
        * ``WEB_AUTHN``: Respond to the challenge with the results of a successful authentication with a WebAuthn authenticator, or passkey, as ``CREDENTIAL``. Examples of WebAuthn authenticators include biometric devices and security keys.
         
        * ``PASSWORD``: Respond with the user's password as ``PASSWORD``.
         
        * ``PASSWORD_SRP``: Respond with the initial SRP secret as ``SRP_A``.
         
        * ``SELECT_CHALLENGE``: Respond with a challenge selection as ``ANSWER``. It must be one of the challenge types in the ``AvailableChallenges`` response parameter. Add the parameters of the selected challenge, for example ``USERNAME`` and ``SMS_OTP``.
         
        * ``SMS_MFA``: Respond with the code that your user pool delivered in an SMS message, as ``SMS_MFA_CODE``
         
        * ``EMAIL_MFA``: Respond with the code that your user pool delivered in an email message, as ``EMAIL_MFA_CODE``

        * ``PASSWORD_VERIFIER``: Respond with the second stage of SRP secrets as ``PASSWORD_CLAIM_SIGNATURE``, ``PASSWORD_CLAIM_SECRET_BLOCK``, and ``TIMESTAMP``.
         
        * ``CUSTOM_CHALLENGE``: This is returned if your custom authentication flow determines that the user should pass another challenge before tokens are issued. The parameters of the challenge are determined by your Lambda function and issued in the ``ChallengeParameters`` of a challenge response.
         
        * ``DEVICE_SRP_AUTH``: Respond with the initial parameters of device SRP authentication. For more information, see `Signing in with a device <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/amazon-cognito-user-pools-device-tracking.html#user-pools-remembered-devices-signing-in-with-a-device>`__.
         
        * ``DEVICE_PASSWORD_VERIFIER``: Respond with ``PASSWORD_CLAIM_SIGNATURE``, ``PASSWORD_CLAIM_SECRET_BLOCK``, and ``TIMESTAMP`` after client-side SRP calculations. For more information, see `Signing in with a device <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/amazon-cognito-user-pools-device-tracking.html#user-pools-remembered-devices-signing-in-with-a-device>`__.
         
        * ``NEW_PASSWORD_REQUIRED``: For users who are required to change their passwords after successful first login. Respond to this challenge with ``NEW_PASSWORD`` and any required attributes that Amazon Cognito returned in the ``requiredAttributes`` parameter. You can also set values for attributes that aren't required by your user pool and that your app client can write. Amazon Cognito only returns this challenge for users who have temporary passwords. When you create passwordless users, you must provide values for all required attributes. 

        .. note::

          In a ``NEW_PASSWORD_REQUIRED`` challenge response, you can't modify a required attribute that already has a value. In ``AdminRespondToAuthChallenge`` or ``RespondToAuthChallenge``, set a value for any keys that Amazon Cognito returned in the ``requiredAttributes`` parameter, then use the ``AdminUpdateUserAttributes`` or ``UpdateUserAttributes`` API operation to modify the value of any additional attributes.

        
         
        * ``MFA_SETUP``: For users who are required to setup an MFA factor before they can sign in. The MFA types activated for the user pool will be listed in the challenge parameters ``MFAS_CAN_SETUP`` value. To set up time-based one-time password (TOTP) MFA, use the session returned in this challenge from ``InitiateAuth`` or ``AdminInitiateAuth`` as an input to ``AssociateSoftwareToken``. Then, use the session returned by ``VerifySoftwareToken`` as an input to ``RespondToAuthChallenge`` or ``AdminRespondToAuthChallenge`` with challenge name ``MFA_SETUP`` to complete sign-in. To set up SMS or email MFA, collect a ``phone_number`` or ``email`` attribute for the user. Then restart the authentication flow with an ``InitiateAuth`` or ``AdminInitiateAuth`` request.
