.. py:method:: CognitoIdentityProvider.Client.confirm_sign_up(**kwargs)

  

  Confirms the account of a new user. This public API operation submits a code that Amazon Cognito sent to your user when they signed up in your user pool. After your user enters their code, they confirm ownership of the email address or phone number that they provided, and their user account becomes active. Depending on your user pool configuration, your users will receive their confirmation code in an email or SMS message.

   

  Local users who signed up in your user pool are the only type of user who can confirm sign-up with a code. Users who federate through an external identity provider (IdP) have already been confirmed by their IdP.

   

  .. note::

    

    Amazon Cognito doesn't evaluate Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies in requests for this API operation. For this operation, you can't use IAM credentials to authorize requests, and you can't grant IAM permissions in policies. For more information about authorization models in Amazon Cognito, see `Using the Amazon Cognito user pools API and user pool endpoints <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pools-API-operations.html>`__.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.confirm_sign_up(
        ClientId='string',
        SecretHash='string',
        Username='string',
        ConfirmationCode='string',
        ForceAliasCreation=True|False,
        AnalyticsMetadata={
            'AnalyticsEndpointId': 'string'
        },
        UserContextData={
            'IpAddress': 'string',
            'EncodedData': 'string'
        },
        ClientMetadata={
            'string': 'string'
        },
        Session='string'
    )
    
  :type ClientId: string
  :param ClientId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ID of the app client associated with the user pool.

    

  
  :type SecretHash: string
  :param SecretHash: 

    A keyed-hash message authentication code (HMAC) calculated using the secret key of a user pool client and username plus the client ID in the message. For more information about ``SecretHash``, see `Computing secret hash values <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/signing-up-users-in-your-app.html#cognito-user-pools-computing-secret-hash>`__.

    

  
  :type Username: string
  :param Username: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of the user that you want to query or modify. The value of this parameter is typically your user's username, but it can be any of their alias attributes. If ``username`` isn't an alias attribute in your user pool, this value must be the ``sub`` of a local user or the username of a user from a third-party IdP.

    

  
  :type ConfirmationCode: string
  :param ConfirmationCode: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The confirmation code that your user pool sent in response to the ``SignUp`` request.

    

  
  :type ForceAliasCreation: boolean
  :param ForceAliasCreation: 

    When ``true``, forces user confirmation despite any existing aliases. Defaults to ``false``. A value of ``true`` migrates the alias from an existing user to the new user if an existing user already has the phone number or email address as an alias.

     

    Say, for example, that an existing user has an ``email`` attribute of ``bob@example.com`` and email is an alias in your user pool. If the new user also has an email of ``bob@example.com`` and your ``ConfirmSignUp`` response sets ``ForceAliasCreation`` to ``true``, the new user can sign in with a username of ``bob@example.com`` and the existing user can no longer do so.

     

    If ``false`` and an attribute belongs to an existing alias, this request returns an **AliasExistsException** error.

     

    For more information about sign-in aliases, see `Customizing sign-in attributes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-attributes.html#user-pool-settings-aliases>`__.

    

  
  :type AnalyticsMetadata: dict
  :param AnalyticsMetadata: 

    Information that supports analytics outcomes with Amazon Pinpoint, including the user's endpoint ID. The endpoint ID is a destination for Amazon Pinpoint push notifications, for example a device identifier, email address, or phone number.

    

  
    - **AnalyticsEndpointId** *(string) --* 

      The endpoint ID. Information that you want to pass to Amazon Pinpoint about where to send notifications.

      

    
  
  :type UserContextData: dict
  :param UserContextData: 

    Contextual data about your user session like the device fingerprint, IP address, or location. Amazon Cognito threat protection evaluates the risk of an authentication event based on the context that your app generates and passes to Amazon Cognito when it makes API requests.

     

    For more information, see `Collecting data for threat protection in applications <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-viewing-threat-protection-app.html>`__.

    

  
    - **IpAddress** *(string) --* 

      The source IP address of your user's device.

      

    
    - **EncodedData** *(string) --* 

      Encoded device-fingerprint details that your app collected with the Amazon Cognito context data collection library. For more information, see `Adding user device and session data to API requests <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pool-settings-adaptive-authentication.html#user-pool-settings-adaptive-authentication-device-fingerprint>`__.

      

    
  
  :type ClientMetadata: dict
  :param ClientMetadata: 

    A map of custom key-value pairs that you can provide as input for any custom workflows that this action triggers.

     

    You create custom workflows by assigning Lambda functions to user pool triggers. When you use the ConfirmSignUp API action, Amazon Cognito invokes the function that is assigned to the *post confirmation* trigger. When Amazon Cognito invokes this function, it passes a JSON payload, which the function receives as input. This payload contains a ``clientMetadata`` attribute, which provides the data that you assigned to the ClientMetadata parameter in your ConfirmSignUp request. In your function code in Lambda, you can process the ``clientMetadata`` value to enhance your workflow for your specific needs.

     

    For more information, see `Using Lambda triggers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools-working-with-aws-lambda-triggers.html>`__ in the *Amazon Cognito Developer Guide*.

     

    .. note::

      

      When you use the ``ClientMetadata`` parameter, note that Amazon Cognito won't do the following:

       

      
      * Store the ``ClientMetadata`` value. This data is available only to Lambda triggers that are assigned to a user pool to support custom workflows. If your user pool configuration doesn't include triggers, the ``ClientMetadata`` parameter serves no purpose.
       
      * Validate the ``ClientMetadata`` value.
       
      * Encrypt the ``ClientMetadata`` value. Don't send sensitive information in this parameter.

      - *(string) --* 

      


  :type Session: string
  :param Session: 

    The optional session ID from a ``SignUp`` API request. You can sign in a user directly from the sign-up process with the ``USER_AUTH`` authentication flow.

    

  
  
  :rtype: dict
  :returns:

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 

      Represents the response from the server for the registration confirmation.

      
      

      - **Session** *(string) --* 

        A session identifier that you can use to immediately sign in the confirmed user. You can automatically sign users in with the one-time password that they provided in a successful ``ConfirmSignUp`` request.
