.. py:method:: CognitoIdentityProvider.Client.get_user_pool_mfa_config(**kwargs)

  

  Given a user pool ID, returns configuration for sign-in with WebAuthn authenticators and for multi-factor authentication (MFA). This operation describes the following:

   

  
  * The WebAuthn relying party (RP) ID and user-verification settings.
   
  * The required, optional, or disabled state of MFA for all user pool users.
   
  * The message templates for email and SMS MFA.
   
  * The enabled or disabled state of time-based one-time password (TOTP) MFA.
  

   

  .. note::

    

    Amazon Cognito evaluates Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies in requests for this API operation. For this operation, you must use IAM credentials to authorize requests, and you must grant yourself the corresponding IAM permission in a policy.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **SmsMfaConfiguration** *(dict) --* 

        Shows user pool configuration for SMS message MFA. Includes the message template and the SMS message sending configuration for Amazon SNS.

        
        

        - **SmsAuthenticationMessage** *(string) --* 

          The SMS authentication message that will be sent to users with the code they must sign in with. The message must contain the ``{####}`` placeholder. Your user pool replaces the placeholder with the MFA code. If this parameter isn't provided, your user pool sends a default message.

          
        

        - **SmsConfiguration** *(dict) --* 

          User pool configuration for delivery of SMS messages with Amazon Simple Notification Service. To send SMS messages with Amazon SNS in the Amazon Web Services Region that you want, the Amazon Cognito user pool uses an Identity and Access Management (IAM) role in your Amazon Web Services account.

           

          You can set ``SmsConfiguration`` in ``CreateUserPool`` and ``UpdateUserPool``, or in ``SetUserPoolMfaConfig``.

          
          

          - **SnsCallerArn** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon SNS caller. This is the ARN of the IAM role in your Amazon Web Services account that Amazon Cognito will use to send SMS messages. SMS messages are subject to a `spending limit <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-email-phone-verification.html>`__.

            
          

          - **ExternalId** *(string) --* 

            The external ID provides additional security for your IAM role. You can use an ``ExternalId`` with the IAM role that you use with Amazon SNS to send SMS messages for your user pool. If you provide an ``ExternalId``, your Amazon Cognito user pool includes it in the request to assume your IAM role. You can configure the role trust policy to require that Amazon Cognito, and any principal, provide the ``ExternalID``. If you use the Amazon Cognito Management Console to create a role for SMS multi-factor authentication (MFA), Amazon Cognito creates a role with the required permissions and a trust policy that demonstrates use of the ``ExternalId``.

             

            For more information about the ``ExternalId`` of a role, see `How to use an external ID when granting access to your Amazon Web Services resources to a third party <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user_externalid.html>`__.

            
          

          - **SnsRegion** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Web Services Region to use with Amazon SNS integration. You can choose the same Region as your user pool, or a supported **Legacy Amazon SNS alternate Region**.

             

            Amazon Cognito resources in the Asia Pacific (Seoul) Amazon Web Services Region must use your Amazon SNS configuration in the Asia Pacific (Tokyo) Region. For more information, see `SMS message settings for Amazon Cognito user pools <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-sms-settings.html>`__.

            
      
    
      

      - **SoftwareTokenMfaConfiguration** *(dict) --* 

        Shows user pool configuration for time-based one-time password (TOTP) MFA. Includes TOTP enabled or disabled state.

        
        

        - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

          The activation state of TOTP MFA.

          
    
      

      - **EmailMfaConfiguration** *(dict) --* 

        Shows configuration for user pool email message MFA and sign-in with one-time passwords (OTPs). Includes the subject and body of the email message template for sign-in and MFA messages. To activate this setting, your user pool must be in the `Essentials tier <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/feature-plans-features-essentials.html>`__ or higher.

        
        

        - **Message** *(string) --* 

          The template for the email messages that your user pool sends to users with codes for MFA and sign-in with email OTPs. The message must contain the ``{####}`` placeholder. In the message, Amazon Cognito replaces this placeholder with the code. If you don't provide this parameter, Amazon Cognito sends messages in the default format.

          
        

        - **Subject** *(string) --* 

          The subject of the email messages that your user pool sends to users with codes for MFA and email OTP sign-in.

          
    
      

      - **MfaConfiguration** *(string) --* 

        Displays the state of multi-factor authentication (MFA) as on, off, or optional. When ``ON``, all users must set up MFA before they can sign in. When ``OPTIONAL``, your application must make a client-side determination of whether a user wants to register an MFA device. For user pools with adaptive authentication with threat protection, choose ``OPTIONAL``.

         

        When ``MfaConfiguration`` is ``OPTIONAL``, managed login doesn't automatically prompt users to set up MFA. Amazon Cognito generates MFA prompts in API responses and in managed login for users who have chosen and configured a preferred MFA factor.

        
      

      - **WebAuthnConfiguration** *(dict) --* 

        Shows user pool configuration for sign-in with passkey authenticators like biometric devices and security keys. Passkeys are not eligible MFA factors. They are instead an eligible primary sign-in factor for `choice-based authentication <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/authentication-flows-selection-sdk.html#authentication-flows-selection-choice>`__, or the ``USER_AUTH`` flow.

        
        

        - **RelyingPartyId** *(string) --* 

          Sets or displays the authentication domain, typically your user pool domain, that passkey providers must use as a relying party (RP) in their configuration.

           

          Under the following conditions, the passkey relying party ID must be the fully-qualified domain name of your custom domain:

           

          
          * The user pool is configured for passkey authentication.
           
          * The user pool has a custom domain, whether or not it also has a prefix domain.
           
          * Your application performs authentication with managed login or the classic hosted UI.
          

          
        

        - **UserVerification** *(string) --* 

          When ``required``, users can only register and sign in users with passkeys that are capable of `user verification <https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#enum-userVerificationRequirement>`__. When ``preferred``, your user pool doesn't require the use of authenticators with user verification but encourages it.
