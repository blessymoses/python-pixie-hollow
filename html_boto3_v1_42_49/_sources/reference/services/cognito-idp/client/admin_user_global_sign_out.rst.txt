.. py:method:: CognitoIdentityProvider.Client.admin_user_global_sign_out(**kwargs)

  

  Invalidates the identity, access, and refresh tokens that Amazon Cognito issued to a user. Call this operation with your administrative credentials when your user signs out of your app. This results in the following behavior.

   

  
  * Amazon Cognito no longer accepts *token-authorized* user operations that you authorize with a signed-out user's access tokens. For more information, see `Using the Amazon Cognito user pools API and user pool endpoints <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pools-API-operations.html>`__. Amazon Cognito returns an ``Access Token has been revoked`` error when your app attempts to authorize a user pools API request with a revoked access token that contains the scope ``aws.cognito.signin.user.admin``.
   
  * Amazon Cognito no longer accepts a signed-out user's ID token in a `GetId <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognitoidentity/latest/APIReference/API_GetId.html>`__ request to an identity pool with ``ServerSideTokenCheck`` enabled for its user pool IdP configuration in `CognitoIdentityProvider <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognitoidentity/latest/APIReference/API_CognitoIdentityProvider.html>`__.
   
  * Amazon Cognito no longer accepts a signed-out user's refresh tokens in refresh requests.
  

   

  Other requests might be valid until your user's token expires. This operation doesn't clear the `managed login <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-managed-login.html>`__ session cookie. To clear the session for a user who signed in with managed login or the classic hosted UI, direct their browser session to the `logout endpoint <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/logout-endpoint.html>`__.

   

  .. note::

    

    Amazon Cognito evaluates Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies in requests for this API operation. For this operation, you must use IAM credentials to authorize requests, and you must grant yourself the corresponding IAM permission in a policy.
