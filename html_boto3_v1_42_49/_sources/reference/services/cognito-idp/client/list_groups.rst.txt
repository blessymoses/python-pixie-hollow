.. py:method:: CognitoIdentityProvider.Client.list_groups(**kwargs)

  

  Given a user pool ID, returns user pool groups and their details.

   

  .. note::

    

    Amazon Cognito evaluates Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies in requests for this API operation. For this operation, you must use IAM credentials to authorize requests, and you must grant yourself the corresponding IAM permission in a policy.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_groups(
        UserPoolId='string',
        Limit=123,
        NextToken='string'
    )
    
  :type UserPoolId: string
  :param UserPoolId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ID of the user pool where you want to list user groups.

    

  
  :type Limit: integer
  :param Limit: 

    The maximum number of groups that you want Amazon Cognito to return in the response.

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    This API operation returns a limited number of results. The pagination token is an identifier that you can present in an additional API request with the same parameters. When you include the pagination token, Amazon Cognito returns the next set of items after the current list. Subsequent requests return a new pagination token. By use of this token, you can paginate through the full list of items.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **Groups** *(list) --* 

        An array of groups and their details. Each entry that's returned includes description, precedence, and IAM role values.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          A user pool group. Contains details about the group and the way that it contributes to IAM role decisions with identity pools. Identity pools can make decisions about the IAM role to assign based on groups: users get credentials for the role associated with their highest-priority group.

          
          

          - **GroupName** *(string) --* 

            The name of the group.

            
          

          - **UserPoolId** *(string) --* 

            The ID of the user pool that contains the group.

            
          

          - **Description** *(string) --* 

            A friendly description of the group.

            
          

          - **RoleArn** *(string) --* 

            The ARN of the IAM role associated with the group. If a group has the highest priority of a user's groups, users who authenticate with an identity pool get credentials for the ``RoleArn`` that's associated with the group.

            
          

          - **Precedence** *(integer) --* 

            A non-negative integer value that specifies the precedence of this group relative to the other groups that a user can belong to in the user pool. Zero is the highest precedence value. Groups with lower ``Precedence`` values take precedence over groups with higher ornull ``Precedence`` values. If a user belongs to two or more groups, it is the group with the lowest precedence value whose role ARN is given in the user's tokens for the ``cognito:roles`` and ``cognito:preferred_role`` claims.

             

            Two groups can have the same ``Precedence`` value. If this happens, neither group takes precedence over the other. If two groups with the same ``Precedence`` have the same role ARN, that role is used in the ``cognito:preferred_role`` claim in tokens for users in each group. If the two groups have different role ARNs, the ``cognito:preferred_role`` claim isn't set in users' tokens.

             

            The default ``Precedence`` value is ``null``.

            
          

          - **LastModifiedDate** *(datetime) --* 

            The date and time when the item was modified. Amazon Cognito returns this timestamp in UNIX epoch time format. Your SDK might render the output in a human-readable format like ISO 8601 or a Java ``Date`` object.

            
          

          - **CreationDate** *(datetime) --* 

            The date and time when the item was created. Amazon Cognito returns this timestamp in UNIX epoch time format. Your SDK might render the output in a human-readable format like ISO 8601 or a Java ``Date`` object.

            
      
    
      

      - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

        The identifier that Amazon Cognito returned with the previous request to this operation. When you include a pagination token in your request, Amazon Cognito returns the next set of items in the list. By use of this token, you can paginate through the full list of items.
