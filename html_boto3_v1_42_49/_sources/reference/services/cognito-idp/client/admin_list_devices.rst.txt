.. py:method:: CognitoIdentityProvider.Client.admin_list_devices(**kwargs)

  

  Lists a user's registered devices. Remembered devices are used in authentication services where you offer a "Remember me" option for users who you want to permit to sign in without MFA from a trusted device. Users can bypass MFA while your application performs device SRP authentication on the back end. For more information, see `Working with devices <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/amazon-cognito-user-pools-device-tracking.html>`__.

   

  .. note::

    

    Amazon Cognito evaluates Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies in requests for this API operation. For this operation, you must use IAM credentials to authorize requests, and you must grant yourself the corresponding IAM permission in a policy.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.admin_list_devices(
        UserPoolId='string',
        Username='string',
        Limit=123,
        PaginationToken='string'
    )
    
  :type UserPoolId: string
  :param UserPoolId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ID of the user pool where the device owner is a user.

    

  
  :type Username: string
  :param Username: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of the user that you want to query or modify. The value of this parameter is typically your user's username, but it can be any of their alias attributes. If ``username`` isn't an alias attribute in your user pool, this value must be the ``sub`` of a local user or the username of a user from a third-party IdP.

    

  
  :type Limit: integer
  :param Limit: 

    The maximum number of devices that you want Amazon Cognito to return in the response.

    

  
  :type PaginationToken: string
  :param PaginationToken: 

    This API operation returns a limited number of results. The pagination token is an identifier that you can present in an additional API request with the same parameters. When you include the pagination token, Amazon Cognito returns the next set of items after the current list. Subsequent requests return a new pagination token. By use of this token, you can paginate through the full list of items.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 

      Lists the device's response, as an administrator.

      
      

      - **Devices** *(list) --* 

        An array of devices and their information. Each entry that's returned includes device information, last-accessed and created dates, and the device key.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          Information about a user's device that they've registered for device SRP authentication in your application. For more information, see `Working with user devices in your user pool <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/amazon-cognito-user-pools-device-tracking.html>`__.

          
          

          - **DeviceKey** *(string) --* 

            The device key, for example ``us-west-2_EXAMPLE-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE22222``.

            
          

          - **DeviceAttributes** *(list) --* 

            Metadata about a user's device, like name and last-access source IP.

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

              The name and value of a user attribute.

          - **DeviceCreateDate** *(datetime) --* 

            The date and time when the item was created. Amazon Cognito returns this timestamp in UNIX epoch time format. Your SDK might render the output in a human-readable format like ISO 8601 or a Java ``Date`` object.

            
          

          - **DeviceLastModifiedDate** *(datetime) --* 

            The date and time when the item was modified. Amazon Cognito returns this timestamp in UNIX epoch time format. Your SDK might render the output in a human-readable format like ISO 8601 or a Java ``Date`` object.
