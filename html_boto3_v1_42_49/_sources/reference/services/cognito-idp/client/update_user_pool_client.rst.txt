.. py:method:: CognitoIdentityProvider.Client.update_user_pool_client(**kwargs)

  

  Given a user pool app client ID, updates the configuration. To avoid setting parameters to Amazon Cognito defaults, construct this API request to pass the existing configuration of your app client, modified to include the changes that you want to make.

   

  .. warning::

     

    If you don't provide a value for an attribute, Amazon Cognito sets it to its default value.

     

   

  Unlike app clients created in the console, Amazon Cognito doesn't automatically assign a branding style to app clients that you configure with this API operation. Managed login and classic hosted UI pages aren't available for your client until after you apply a branding style.

   

  .. note::

    

    Amazon Cognito evaluates Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies in requests for this API operation. For this operation, you must use IAM credentials to authorize requests, and you must grant yourself the corresponding IAM permission in a policy.

  :type UserPoolId: string
  :param UserPoolId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ID of the user pool where you want to update the app client.

    

  
  :type ClientId: string
  :param ClientId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ID of the app client that you want to update.

    

  
  :type ClientName: string
  :param ClientName: 

    A friendly name for the app client.

    

  
  :type RefreshTokenValidity: integer
  :param RefreshTokenValidity: 

    The refresh token time limit. After this limit expires, your user can't use their refresh token. To specify the time unit for ``RefreshTokenValidity`` as ``seconds``, ``minutes``, ``hours``, or ``days``, set a ``TokenValidityUnits`` value in your API request.

     

    For example, when you set ``RefreshTokenValidity`` as ``10`` and ``TokenValidityUnits`` as ``days``, your user can refresh their session and retrieve new access and ID tokens for 10 days.

     

    The default time unit for ``RefreshTokenValidity`` in an API request is days. You can't set ``RefreshTokenValidity`` to 0. If you do, Amazon Cognito overrides the value with the default value of 30 days. *Valid range* is displayed below in seconds.

     

    If you don't specify otherwise in the configuration of your app client, your refresh tokens are valid for 30 days.

    

  
  :type AccessTokenValidity: integer
  :param AccessTokenValidity: 

    The access token time limit. After this limit expires, your user can't use their access token. To specify the time unit for ``AccessTokenValidity`` as ``seconds``, ``minutes``, ``hours``, or ``days``, set a ``TokenValidityUnits`` value in your API request.

     

    For example, when you set ``AccessTokenValidity`` to ``10`` and ``TokenValidityUnits`` to ``hours``, your user can authorize access with their access token for 10 hours.

     

    The default time unit for ``AccessTokenValidity`` in an API request is hours. *Valid range* is displayed below in seconds.

     

    If you don't specify otherwise in the configuration of your app client, your access tokens are valid for one hour.

    

  
  :type IdTokenValidity: integer
  :param IdTokenValidity: 

    The ID token time limit. After this limit expires, your user can't use their ID token. To specify the time unit for ``IdTokenValidity`` as ``seconds``, ``minutes``, ``hours``, or ``days``, set a ``TokenValidityUnits`` value in your API request.

     

    For example, when you set ``IdTokenValidity`` as ``10`` and ``TokenValidityUnits`` as ``hours``, your user can authenticate their session with their ID token for 10 hours.

     

    The default time unit for ``IdTokenValidity`` in an API request is hours. *Valid range* is displayed below in seconds.

     

    If you don't specify otherwise in the configuration of your app client, your ID tokens are valid for one hour.

    

  
  :type TokenValidityUnits: dict
  :param TokenValidityUnits: 

    The units that validity times are represented in. The default unit for refresh tokens is days, and the default for ID and access tokens are hours.

    

  
    - **AccessToken** *(string) --* 

      A time unit for the value that you set in the ``AccessTokenValidity`` parameter. The default ``AccessTokenValidity`` time unit is ``hours``. ``AccessTokenValidity`` duration can range from five minutes to one day.

      

    
    - **IdToken** *(string) --* 

      A time unit for the value that you set in the ``IdTokenValidity`` parameter. The default ``IdTokenValidity`` time unit is ``hours``. ``IdTokenValidity`` duration can range from five minutes to one day.

      

    
    - **RefreshToken** *(string) --* 

      A time unit for the value that you set in the ``RefreshTokenValidity`` parameter. The default ``RefreshTokenValidity`` time unit is ``days``. ``RefreshTokenValidity`` duration can range from 60 minutes to 10 years.

      

    
  
  :type ReadAttributes: list
  :param ReadAttributes: 

    The list of user attributes that you want your app client to have read access to. After your user authenticates in your app, their access token authorizes them to read their own attribute value for any attribute in this list.

     

    When you don't specify the ``ReadAttributes`` for your app client, your app can read the values of ``email_verified``, ``phone_number_verified``, and the standard attributes of your user pool. When your user pool app client has read access to these default attributes, ``ReadAttributes`` doesn't return any information. Amazon Cognito only populates ``ReadAttributes`` in the API response if you have specified your own custom set of read attributes.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type WriteAttributes: list
  :param WriteAttributes: 

    The list of user attributes that you want your app client to have write access to. After your user authenticates in your app, their access token authorizes them to set or modify their own attribute value for any attribute in this list.

     

    When you don't specify the ``WriteAttributes`` for your app client, your app can write the values of the Standard attributes of your user pool. When your user pool has write access to these default attributes, ``WriteAttributes`` doesn't return any information. Amazon Cognito only populates ``WriteAttributes`` in the API response if you have specified your own custom set of write attributes.

     

    If your app client allows users to sign in through an IdP, this array must include all attributes that you have mapped to IdP attributes. Amazon Cognito updates mapped attributes when users sign in to your application through an IdP. If your app client does not have write access to a mapped attribute, Amazon Cognito throws an error when it tries to update the attribute. For more information, see `Specifying IdP Attribute Mappings for Your user pool <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-specifying-attribute-mapping.html>`__.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type ExplicitAuthFlows: list
  :param ExplicitAuthFlows: 

    The `authentication flows <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/amazon-cognito-user-pools-authentication-flow-methods.html>`__ that you want your user pool client to support. For each app client in your user pool, you can sign in your users with any combination of one or more flows, including with a user name and Secure Remote Password (SRP), a user name and password, or a custom authentication process that you define with Lambda functions.

     

    .. note::

      

      If you don't specify a value for ``ExplicitAuthFlows``, your app client supports ``ALLOW_REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH``, ``ALLOW_USER_SRP_AUTH``, and ``ALLOW_CUSTOM_AUTH``.

      

     

    The values for authentication flow options include the following.

     

    
    * ``ALLOW_USER_AUTH``: Enable selection-based sign-in with ``USER_AUTH``. This setting covers username-password, secure remote password (SRP), passwordless, and passkey authentication. This authentiation flow can do username-password and SRP authentication without other ``ExplicitAuthFlows`` permitting them. For example users can complete an SRP challenge through ``USER_AUTH`` without the flow ``USER_SRP_AUTH`` being active for the app client. This flow doesn't include ``CUSTOM_AUTH``. To activate this setting, your user pool must be in the `Essentials tier <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/feature-plans-features-essentials.html>`__ or higher.
     
    * ``ALLOW_ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH``: Enable admin based user password authentication flow ``ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH``. This setting replaces the ``ADMIN_NO_SRP_AUTH`` setting. With this authentication flow, your app passes a user name and password to Amazon Cognito in the request, instead of using the Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol to securely transmit the password.
     
    * ``ALLOW_CUSTOM_AUTH``: Enable Lambda trigger based authentication.
     
    * ``ALLOW_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH``: Enable user password-based authentication. In this flow, Amazon Cognito receives the password in the request instead of using the SRP protocol to verify passwords.
     
    * ``ALLOW_USER_SRP_AUTH``: Enable SRP-based authentication.
     
    * ``ALLOW_REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH``: Enable authflow to refresh tokens.
    

     

    In some environments, you will see the values ``ADMIN_NO_SRP_AUTH``, ``CUSTOM_AUTH_FLOW_ONLY``, or ``USER_PASSWORD_AUTH``. You can't assign these legacy ``ExplicitAuthFlows`` values to user pool clients at the same time as values that begin with ``ALLOW_``, like ``ALLOW_USER_SRP_AUTH``.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type SupportedIdentityProviders: list
  :param SupportedIdentityProviders: 

    A list of provider names for the identity providers (IdPs) that are supported on this client. The following are supported: ``COGNITO``, ``Facebook``, ``Google``, ``SignInWithApple``, and ``LoginWithAmazon``. You can also specify the names that you configured for the SAML and OIDC IdPs in your user pool, for example ``MySAMLIdP`` or ``MyOIDCIdP``.

     

    This parameter sets the IdPs that `managed login <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-managed-login.html>`__ will display on the login page for your app client. The removal of ``COGNITO`` from this list doesn't prevent authentication operations for local users with the user pools API in an Amazon Web Services SDK. The only way to prevent SDK-based authentication is to block access with a `WAF rule <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-waf.html>`__.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type CallbackURLs: list
  :param CallbackURLs: 

    A list of allowed redirect, or callback, URLs for managed login authentication. These URLs are the paths where you want to send your users' browsers after they complete authentication with managed login or a third-party IdP. Typically, callback URLs are the home of an application that uses OAuth or OIDC libraries to process authentication outcomes.

     

    A redirect URI must meet the following requirements:

     

    
    * Be an absolute URI.
     
    * Be registered with the authorization server. Amazon Cognito doesn't accept authorization requests with ``redirect_uri`` values that aren't in the list of ``CallbackURLs`` that you provide in this parameter.
     
    * Not include a fragment component.
    

     

    See `OAuth 2.0 - Redirection Endpoint <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-3.1.2>`__.

     

    Amazon Cognito requires HTTPS over HTTP except for http://localhost for testing purposes only.

     

    App callback URLs such as ``myapp://example`` are also supported.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type LogoutURLs: list
  :param LogoutURLs: 

    A list of allowed logout URLs for managed login authentication. When you pass ``logout_uri`` and ``client_id`` parameters to ``/logout``, Amazon Cognito signs out your user and redirects them to the logout URL. This parameter describes the URLs that you want to be the permitted targets of ``logout_uri``. A typical use of these URLs is when a user selects "Sign out" and you redirect them to your public homepage. For more information, see `Logout endpoint <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/logout-endpoint.html>`__.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type DefaultRedirectURI: string
  :param DefaultRedirectURI: 

    The default redirect URI. In app clients with one assigned IdP, replaces ``redirect_uri`` in authentication requests. Must be in the ``CallbackURLs`` list.

    

  
  :type AllowedOAuthFlows: list
  :param AllowedOAuthFlows: 

    The OAuth grant types that you want your app client to generate. To create an app client that generates client credentials grants, you must add ``client_credentials`` as the only allowed OAuth flow.

      code  

    Use a code grant flow, which provides an authorization code as the response. This code can be exchanged for access tokens with the ``/oauth2/token`` endpoint.

      implicit  

    Issue the access token (and, optionally, ID token, based on scopes) directly to your user.

      client_credentials  

    Issue the access token from the ``/oauth2/token`` endpoint directly to a non-person user using a combination of the client ID and client secret.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type AllowedOAuthScopes: list
  :param AllowedOAuthScopes: 

    The OAuth, OpenID Connect (OIDC), and custom scopes that you want to permit your app client to authorize access with. Scopes govern access control to user pool self-service API operations, user data from the ``userInfo`` endpoint, and third-party APIs. Scope values include ``phone``, ``email``, ``openid``, and ``profile``. The ``aws.cognito.signin.user.admin`` scope authorizes user self-service operations. Custom scopes with resource servers authorize access to external APIs.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type AllowedOAuthFlowsUserPoolClient: boolean
  :param AllowedOAuthFlowsUserPoolClient: 

    Set to ``true`` to use OAuth 2.0 authorization server features in your app client.

     

    This parameter must have a value of ``true`` before you can configure the following features in your app client.

     

    
    * ``CallBackURLs``: Callback URLs.
     
    * ``LogoutURLs``: Sign-out redirect URLs.
     
    * ``AllowedOAuthScopes``: OAuth 2.0 scopes.
     
    * ``AllowedOAuthFlows``: Support for authorization code, implicit, and client credentials OAuth 2.0 grants.
    

     

    To use authorization server features, configure one of these features in the Amazon Cognito console or set ``AllowedOAuthFlowsUserPoolClient`` to ``true`` in a ``CreateUserPoolClient`` or ``UpdateUserPoolClient`` API request. If you don't set a value for ``AllowedOAuthFlowsUserPoolClient`` in a request with the CLI or SDKs, it defaults to ``false``. When ``false``, only SDK-based API sign-in is permitted.

    

  
  :type AnalyticsConfiguration: dict
  :param AnalyticsConfiguration: 

    The user pool analytics configuration for collecting metrics and sending them to your Amazon Pinpoint campaign.

     

    In Amazon Web Services Regions where Amazon Pinpoint isn't available, user pools might not have access to analytics or might be configurable with campaigns in the US East (N. Virginia) Region. For more information, see `Using Amazon Pinpoint analytics <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-pinpoint-integration.html>`__.

    

  
    - **ApplicationId** *(string) --* 

      Your Amazon Pinpoint project ID.

      

    
    - **ApplicationArn** *(string) --* 

      The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Amazon Pinpoint project that you want to connect to your user pool app client. Amazon Cognito publishes events to the Amazon Pinpoint project that ``ApplicationArn`` declares. You can also configure your application to pass an endpoint ID in the ``AnalyticsMetadata`` parameter of sign-in operations. The endpoint ID is information about the destination for push notifications

      

    
    - **RoleArn** *(string) --* 

      The ARN of an Identity and Access Management role that has the permissions required for Amazon Cognito to publish events to Amazon Pinpoint analytics.

      

    
    - **ExternalId** *(string) --* 

      The `external ID <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user_externalid.html>`__ of the role that Amazon Cognito assumes to send analytics data to Amazon Pinpoint.

      

    
    - **UserDataShared** *(boolean) --* 

      If ``UserDataShared`` is ``true``, Amazon Cognito includes user data in the events that it publishes to Amazon Pinpoint analytics.

      

    
  
  :type PreventUserExistenceErrors: string
  :param PreventUserExistenceErrors: 

    When ``ENABLED``, suppresses messages that might indicate a valid user exists when someone attempts sign-in. This parameters sets your preference for the errors and responses that you want Amazon Cognito APIs to return during authentication, account confirmation, and password recovery when the user doesn't exist in the user pool. When set to ``ENABLED`` and the user doesn't exist, authentication returns an error indicating either the username or password was incorrect. Account confirmation and password recovery return a response indicating a code was sent to a simulated destination. When set to ``LEGACY``, those APIs return a ``UserNotFoundException`` exception if the user doesn't exist in the user pool.

     

    Defaults to ``LEGACY``.

    

  
  :type EnableTokenRevocation: boolean
  :param EnableTokenRevocation: 

    Activates or deactivates `token revocation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/token-revocation.html>`__ in the target app client.

    

  
  :type EnablePropagateAdditionalUserContextData: boolean
  :param EnablePropagateAdditionalUserContextData: 

    When ``true``, your application can include additional ``UserContextData`` in authentication requests. This data includes the IP address, and contributes to analysis by threat protection features. For more information about propagation of user context data, see `Adding session data to API requests <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pool-settings-adaptive-authentication.html#user-pool-settings-adaptive-authentication-device-fingerprint>`__. If you don’t include this parameter, you can't send the source IP address to Amazon Cognito threat protection features. You can only activate ``EnablePropagateAdditionalUserContextData`` in an app client that has a client secret.

    

  
  :type AuthSessionValidity: integer
  :param AuthSessionValidity: 

    Amazon Cognito creates a session token for each API request in an authentication flow. ``AuthSessionValidity`` is the duration, in minutes, of that session token. Your user pool native user must respond to each authentication challenge before the session expires.

    

  
  :type RefreshTokenRotation: dict
  :param RefreshTokenRotation: 

    The configuration of your app client for refresh token rotation. When enabled, your app client issues new ID, access, and refresh tokens when users renew their sessions with refresh tokens. When disabled, token refresh issues only ID and access tokens.

    

  
    - **Feature** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The state of refresh token rotation for the current app client.

      

    
    - **RetryGracePeriodSeconds** *(integer) --* 

      When you request a token refresh with ``GetTokensFromRefreshToken``, the original refresh token that you're rotating out can remain valid for a period of time of up to 60 seconds. This allows for client-side retries. When ``RetryGracePeriodSeconds`` is ``0``, the grace period is disabled and a successful request immediately invalidates the submitted refresh token.

      Represents the response from the server to the request to update the user pool client.

      
      

      - **UserPoolClient** *(dict) --* 

        The updated details of your app client.

        
        

        - **UserPoolId** *(string) --* 

          The ID of the user pool associated with the app client.

          
        

        - **ClientName** *(string) --* 

          The name of the app client.

          
        

        - **ClientId** *(string) --* 

          The ID of the app client.

          
        

        - **ClientSecret** *(string) --* 

          The app client secret.

          
        

        - **LastModifiedDate** *(datetime) --* 

          The date and time when the item was modified. Amazon Cognito returns this timestamp in UNIX epoch time format. Your SDK might render the output in a human-readable format like ISO 8601 or a Java ``Date`` object.

          
        

        - **CreationDate** *(datetime) --* 

          The date and time when the item was created. Amazon Cognito returns this timestamp in UNIX epoch time format. Your SDK might render the output in a human-readable format like ISO 8601 or a Java ``Date`` object.

          
        

        - **RefreshTokenValidity** *(integer) --* 

          The refresh token time limit. After this limit expires, your user can't use their refresh token. To specify the time unit for ``RefreshTokenValidity`` as ``seconds``, ``minutes``, ``hours``, or ``days``, set a ``TokenValidityUnits`` value in your API request.

           

          For example, when you set ``RefreshTokenValidity`` as ``10`` and ``TokenValidityUnits`` as ``days``, your user can refresh their session and retrieve new access and ID tokens for 10 days.

           

          The default time unit for ``RefreshTokenValidity`` in an API request is days. You can't set ``RefreshTokenValidity`` to 0. If you do, Amazon Cognito overrides the value with the default value of 30 days. *Valid range* is displayed below in seconds.

           

          If you don't specify otherwise in the configuration of your app client, your refresh tokens are valid for 30 days.

          
        

        - **AccessTokenValidity** *(integer) --* 

          The access token time limit. After this limit expires, your user can't use their access token. To specify the time unit for ``AccessTokenValidity`` as ``seconds``, ``minutes``, ``hours``, or ``days``, set a ``TokenValidityUnits`` value in your API request.

           

          For example, when you set ``AccessTokenValidity`` to ``10`` and ``TokenValidityUnits`` to ``hours``, your user can authorize access with their access token for 10 hours.

           

          The default time unit for ``AccessTokenValidity`` in an API request is hours. *Valid range* is displayed below in seconds.

           

          If you don't specify otherwise in the configuration of your app client, your access tokens are valid for one hour.

          
        

        - **IdTokenValidity** *(integer) --* 

          The ID token time limit. After this limit expires, your user can't use their ID token. To specify the time unit for ``IdTokenValidity`` as ``seconds``, ``minutes``, ``hours``, or ``days``, set a ``TokenValidityUnits`` value in your API request.

           

          For example, when you set ``IdTokenValidity`` as ``10`` and ``TokenValidityUnits`` as ``hours``, your user can authenticate their session with their ID token for 10 hours.

           

          The default time unit for ``IdTokenValidity`` in an API request is hours. *Valid range* is displayed below in seconds.

           

          If you don't specify otherwise in the configuration of your app client, your ID tokens are valid for one hour.

          
        

        - **TokenValidityUnits** *(dict) --* 

          The time units that, with ``IdTokenValidity``, ``AccessTokenValidity``, and ``RefreshTokenValidity``, set and display the duration of ID, access, and refresh tokens for an app client. You can assign a separate token validity unit to each type of token.

          
          

          - **AccessToken** *(string) --* 

            A time unit for the value that you set in the ``AccessTokenValidity`` parameter. The default ``AccessTokenValidity`` time unit is ``hours``. ``AccessTokenValidity`` duration can range from five minutes to one day.

            
          

          - **IdToken** *(string) --* 

            A time unit for the value that you set in the ``IdTokenValidity`` parameter. The default ``IdTokenValidity`` time unit is ``hours``. ``IdTokenValidity`` duration can range from five minutes to one day.

            
          

          - **RefreshToken** *(string) --* 

            A time unit for the value that you set in the ``RefreshTokenValidity`` parameter. The default ``RefreshTokenValidity`` time unit is ``days``. ``RefreshTokenValidity`` duration can range from 60 minutes to 10 years.

            
      
        

        - **ReadAttributes** *(list) --* 

          The list of user attributes that you want your app client to have read access to. After your user authenticates in your app, their access token authorizes them to read their own attribute value for any attribute in this list.

           

          When you don't specify the ``ReadAttributes`` for your app client, your app can read the values of ``email_verified``, ``phone_number_verified``, and the standard attributes of your user pool. When your user pool app client has read access to these default attributes, ``ReadAttributes`` doesn't return any information. Amazon Cognito only populates ``ReadAttributes`` in the API response if you have specified your own custom set of read attributes.

          
          

          - *(string) --* 
      
        

        - **WriteAttributes** *(list) --* 

          The list of user attributes that you want your app client to have write access to. After your user authenticates in your app, their access token authorizes them to set or modify their own attribute value for any attribute in this list.

           

          When you don't specify the ``WriteAttributes`` for your app client, your app can write the values of the Standard attributes of your user pool. When your user pool has write access to these default attributes, ``WriteAttributes`` doesn't return any information. Amazon Cognito only populates ``WriteAttributes`` in the API response if you have specified your own custom set of write attributes.

           

          If your app client allows users to sign in through an IdP, this array must include all attributes that you have mapped to IdP attributes. Amazon Cognito updates mapped attributes when users sign in to your application through an IdP. If your app client does not have write access to a mapped attribute, Amazon Cognito throws an error when it tries to update the attribute. For more information, see `Specifying IdP Attribute Mappings for Your user pool <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-specifying-attribute-mapping.html>`__.

          
          

          - *(string) --* 
      
        

        - **ExplicitAuthFlows** *(list) --* 

          The `authentication flows <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/amazon-cognito-user-pools-authentication-flow-methods.html>`__ that you want your user pool client to support. For each app client in your user pool, you can sign in your users with any combination of one or more flows, including with a user name and Secure Remote Password (SRP), a user name and password, or a custom authentication process that you define with Lambda functions.

           

          .. note::

            

            If you don't specify a value for ``ExplicitAuthFlows``, your app client supports ``ALLOW_REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH``, ``ALLOW_USER_SRP_AUTH``, and ``ALLOW_CUSTOM_AUTH``.

            

           

          The values for authentication flow options include the following.

           

          
          * ``ALLOW_USER_AUTH``: Enable selection-based sign-in with ``USER_AUTH``. This setting covers username-password, secure remote password (SRP), passwordless, and passkey authentication. This authentiation flow can do username-password and SRP authentication without other ``ExplicitAuthFlows`` permitting them. For example users can complete an SRP challenge through ``USER_AUTH`` without the flow ``USER_SRP_AUTH`` being active for the app client. This flow doesn't include ``CUSTOM_AUTH``. To activate this setting, your user pool must be in the `Essentials tier <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/feature-plans-features-essentials.html>`__ or higher.
           
          * ``ALLOW_ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH``: Enable admin based user password authentication flow ``ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH``. This setting replaces the ``ADMIN_NO_SRP_AUTH`` setting. With this authentication flow, your app passes a user name and password to Amazon Cognito in the request, instead of using the Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol to securely transmit the password.
           
          * ``ALLOW_CUSTOM_AUTH``: Enable Lambda trigger based authentication.
           
          * ``ALLOW_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH``: Enable user password-based authentication. In this flow, Amazon Cognito receives the password in the request instead of using the SRP protocol to verify passwords.
           
          * ``ALLOW_USER_SRP_AUTH``: Enable SRP-based authentication.
           
          * ``ALLOW_REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH``: Enable authflow to refresh tokens.
          

           

          In some environments, you will see the values ``ADMIN_NO_SRP_AUTH``, ``CUSTOM_AUTH_FLOW_ONLY``, or ``USER_PASSWORD_AUTH``. You can't assign these legacy ``ExplicitAuthFlows`` values to user pool clients at the same time as values that begin with ``ALLOW_``, like ``ALLOW_USER_SRP_AUTH``.

          
          

          - *(string) --* 
      
        

        - **SupportedIdentityProviders** *(list) --* 

          A list of provider names for the identity providers (IdPs) that are supported on this client. The following are supported: ``COGNITO``, ``Facebook``, ``Google``, ``SignInWithApple``, and ``LoginWithAmazon``. You can also specify the names that you configured for the SAML and OIDC IdPs in your user pool, for example ``MySAMLIdP`` or ``MyOIDCIdP``.

           

          This parameter sets the IdPs that `managed login <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-managed-login.html>`__ will display on the login page for your app client. The removal of ``COGNITO`` from this list doesn't prevent authentication operations for local users with the user pools API in an Amazon Web Services SDK. The only way to prevent SDK-based authentication is to block access with a `WAF rule <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-waf.html>`__.

          
          

          - *(string) --* 
      
        

        - **CallbackURLs** *(list) --* 

          A list of allowed redirect (callback) URLs for the IdPs.

           

          A redirect URI must:

           

          
          * Be an absolute URI.
           
          * Be registered with the authorization server.
           
          * Not include a fragment component.
          

           

          See `OAuth 2.0 - Redirection Endpoint <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-3.1.2>`__.

           

          Amazon Cognito requires HTTPS over HTTP except for http://localhost for testing purposes only.

           

          App callback URLs such as myapp://example are also supported.

          
          

          - *(string) --* 
      
        

        - **LogoutURLs** *(list) --* 

          A list of allowed logout URLs for the IdPs.

          
          

          - *(string) --* 
      
        

        - **DefaultRedirectURI** *(string) --* 

          The default redirect URI. Must be in the ``CallbackURLs`` list.

           

          A redirect URI must:

           

          
          * Be an absolute URI.
           
          * Be registered with the authorization server.
           
          * Not include a fragment component.
          

           

          See `OAuth 2.0 - Redirection Endpoint <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-3.1.2>`__.

           

          Amazon Cognito requires HTTPS over HTTP except for http://localhost for testing purposes only.

           

          App callback URLs such as myapp://example are also supported.

          
        

        - **AllowedOAuthFlows** *(list) --* 

          The OAuth grant types that you want your app client to generate. To create an app client that generates client credentials grants, you must add ``client_credentials`` as the only allowed OAuth flow.

            code  

          Use a code grant flow, which provides an authorization code as the response. This code can be exchanged for access tokens with the ``/oauth2/token`` endpoint.

            implicit  

          Issue the access token (and, optionally, ID token, based on scopes) directly to your user.

            client_credentials  

          Issue the access token from the ``/oauth2/token`` endpoint directly to a non-person user using a combination of the client ID and client secret.

          
          

          - *(string) --* 
      
        

        - **AllowedOAuthScopes** *(list) --* 

          The OAuth 2.0 scopes that you want your app client to support. Can include standard OAuth scopes like ``phone``, ``email``, ``openid``, and ``profile``. Can also include the ``aws.cognito.signin.user.admin`` scope that authorizes user profile self-service operations and custom scopes from resource servers.

          
          

          - *(string) --* 
      
        

        - **AllowedOAuthFlowsUserPoolClient** *(boolean) --* 

          Set to ``true`` to use OAuth 2.0 authorization server features in your app client.

           

          This parameter must have a value of ``true`` before you can configure the following features in your app client.

           

          
          * ``CallBackURLs``: Callback URLs.
           
          * ``LogoutURLs``: Sign-out redirect URLs.
           
          * ``AllowedOAuthScopes``: OAuth 2.0 scopes.
           
          * ``AllowedOAuthFlows``: Support for authorization code, implicit, and client credentials OAuth 2.0 grants.
          

           

          To use authorization server features, configure one of these features in the Amazon Cognito console or set ``AllowedOAuthFlowsUserPoolClient`` to ``true`` in a ``CreateUserPoolClient`` or ``UpdateUserPoolClient`` API request. If you don't set a value for ``AllowedOAuthFlowsUserPoolClient`` in a request with the CLI or SDKs, it defaults to ``false``. When ``false``, only SDK-based API sign-in is permitted.

          
        

        - **AnalyticsConfiguration** *(dict) --* 

          The user pool analytics configuration for collecting metrics and sending them to your Amazon Pinpoint campaign.

           

          .. note::

            

            In Amazon Web Services Regions where Amazon Pinpoint isn't available, user pools only support sending events to Amazon Pinpoint projects in Amazon Web Services Region us-east-1. In Regions where Amazon Pinpoint is available, user pools support sending events to Amazon Pinpoint projects within that same Region.

            

          
          

          - **ApplicationId** *(string) --* 

            Your Amazon Pinpoint project ID.

            
          

          - **ApplicationArn** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Amazon Pinpoint project that you want to connect to your user pool app client. Amazon Cognito publishes events to the Amazon Pinpoint project that ``ApplicationArn`` declares. You can also configure your application to pass an endpoint ID in the ``AnalyticsMetadata`` parameter of sign-in operations. The endpoint ID is information about the destination for push notifications

            
          

          - **RoleArn** *(string) --* 

            The ARN of an Identity and Access Management role that has the permissions required for Amazon Cognito to publish events to Amazon Pinpoint analytics.

            
          

          - **ExternalId** *(string) --* 

            The `external ID <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user_externalid.html>`__ of the role that Amazon Cognito assumes to send analytics data to Amazon Pinpoint.

            
          

          - **UserDataShared** *(boolean) --* 

            If ``UserDataShared`` is ``true``, Amazon Cognito includes user data in the events that it publishes to Amazon Pinpoint analytics.

            
      
        

        - **PreventUserExistenceErrors** *(string) --* 

          When ``ENABLED``, suppresses messages that might indicate a valid user exists when someone attempts sign-in. This parameters sets your preference for the errors and responses that you want Amazon Cognito APIs to return during authentication, account confirmation, and password recovery when the user doesn't exist in the user pool. When set to ``ENABLED`` and the user doesn't exist, authentication returns an error indicating either the username or password was incorrect. Account confirmation and password recovery return a response indicating a code was sent to a simulated destination. When set to ``LEGACY``, those APIs return a ``UserNotFoundException`` exception if the user doesn't exist in the user pool.

           

          Defaults to ``LEGACY``.

          
        

        - **EnableTokenRevocation** *(boolean) --* 

          Indicates whether token revocation is activated for the user pool client. When you create a new user pool client, token revocation is activated by default.

          
        

        - **EnablePropagateAdditionalUserContextData** *(boolean) --* 

          When ``EnablePropagateAdditionalUserContextData`` is true, Amazon Cognito accepts an ``IpAddress`` value that you send in the ``UserContextData`` parameter. The ``UserContextData`` parameter sends information to Amazon Cognito threat protection for risk analysis. You can send ``UserContextData`` when you sign in Amazon Cognito native users with the ``InitiateAuth`` and ``RespondToAuthChallenge`` API operations.

           

          When ``EnablePropagateAdditionalUserContextData`` is false, you can't send your user's source IP address to Amazon Cognito threat protection with unauthenticated API operations. ``EnablePropagateAdditionalUserContextData`` doesn't affect whether you can send a source IP address in a ``ContextData`` parameter with the authenticated API operations ``AdminInitiateAuth`` and ``AdminRespondToAuthChallenge``.

           

          You can only activate ``EnablePropagateAdditionalUserContextData`` in an app client that has a client secret. For more information about propagation of user context data, see `Adding user device and session data to API requests <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pool-settings-adaptive-authentication.html#user-pool-settings-adaptive-authentication-device-fingerprint>`__.

          
        

        - **AuthSessionValidity** *(integer) --* 

          Amazon Cognito creates a session token for each API request in an authentication flow. ``AuthSessionValidity`` is the duration, in minutes, of that session token. Your user pool native user must respond to each authentication challenge before the session expires.

          
        

        - **RefreshTokenRotation** *(dict) --* 

          The configuration of your app client for refresh token rotation. When enabled, your app client issues new ID, access, and refresh tokens when users renew their sessions with refresh tokens. When disabled, token refresh issues only ID and access tokens.

          
          

          - **Feature** *(string) --* 

            The state of refresh token rotation for the current app client.

            
          

          - **RetryGracePeriodSeconds** *(integer) --* 

            When you request a token refresh with ``GetTokensFromRefreshToken``, the original refresh token that you're rotating out can remain valid for a period of time of up to 60 seconds. This allows for client-side retries. When ``RetryGracePeriodSeconds`` is ``0``, the grace period is disabled and a successful request immediately invalidates the submitted refresh token.
