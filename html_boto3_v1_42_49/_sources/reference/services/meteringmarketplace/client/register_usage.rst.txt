.. py:method:: MarketplaceMetering.Client.register_usage(**kwargs)

  

  Paid container software products sold through Amazon Web Services Marketplace must integrate with the Amazon Web Services Marketplace Metering Service and call the ``RegisterUsage`` operation for software entitlement and metering. Free and BYOL products for Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS aren't required to call ``RegisterUsage``, but you may choose to do so if you would like to receive usage data in your seller reports. The sections below explain the behavior of ``RegisterUsage``. ``RegisterUsage`` performs two primary functions: metering and entitlement.

   

  
  * *Entitlement*: ``RegisterUsage`` allows you to verify that the customer running your paid software is subscribed to your product on Amazon Web Services Marketplace, enabling you to guard against unauthorized use. Your container image that integrates with ``RegisterUsage`` is only required to guard against unauthorized use at container startup, as such a ``CustomerNotSubscribedException`` or ``PlatformNotSupportedException`` will only be thrown on the initial call to ``RegisterUsage``. Subsequent calls from the same Amazon ECS task instance (e.g. task-id) or Amazon EKS pod will not throw a ``CustomerNotSubscribedException``, even if the customer unsubscribes while the Amazon ECS task or Amazon EKS pod is still running.
   
  * *Metering*: ``RegisterUsage`` meters software use per ECS task, per hour, or per pod for Amazon EKS with usage prorated to the second. A minimum of 1 minute of usage applies to tasks that are short lived. For example, if a customer has a 10 node Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS cluster and a service configured as a Daemon Set, then Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS will launch a task on all 10 cluster nodes and the customer will be charged for 10 tasks. Software metering is handled by the Amazon Web Services Marketplace metering control plane—your software is not required to perform metering-specific actions other than to call ``RegisterUsage`` to commence metering. The Amazon Web Services Marketplace metering control plane will also bill customers for running ECS tasks and Amazon EKS pods, regardless of the customer's subscription state, which removes the need for your software to run entitlement checks at runtime. For containers, ``RegisterUsage`` should be called immediately at launch. If you don’t register the container within the first 6 hours of the launch, Amazon Web Services Marketplace Metering Service doesn’t provide any metering guarantees for previous months. Metering will continue, however, for the current month forward until the container ends. ``RegisterUsage`` is for metering paid hourly container products. For Amazon Web Services Regions that support ``RegisterUsage``, see `RegisterUsage Region support <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/APIReference/metering-regions.html#registerusage-region-support>`__.
