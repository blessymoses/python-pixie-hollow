.. py:class:: IoTDataPlane.Client

  A low-level client representing AWS IoT Data Plane
   

  IoT data enables secure, bi-directional communication between Internet-connected things (such as sensors, actuators, embedded devices, or smart appliances) and the Amazon Web Services cloud. It implements a broker for applications and things to publish messages over HTTP (Publish) and retrieve, update, and delete shadows. A shadow is a persistent representation of your things and their state in the Amazon Web Services cloud.

   

  Find the endpoint address for actions in IoT data by running this CLI command:

   

  ``aws iot describe-endpoint --endpoint-type iot:Data-ATS``

   

  The service name used by `Amazon Web ServicesSignature Version 4 <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html>`__ to sign requests is: *iotdevicegateway*.
