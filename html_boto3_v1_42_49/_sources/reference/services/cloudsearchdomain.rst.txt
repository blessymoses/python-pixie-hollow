.. py:class:: CloudSearchDomain.Client

  A low-level client representing Amazon CloudSearch Domain
  

  You use the AmazonCloudSearch2013 API to upload documents to a search domain and search those documents.

   

  The endpoints for submitting ``UploadDocuments``, ``Search``, and ``Suggest`` requests are domain-specific. To get the endpoints for your domain, use the Amazon CloudSearch configuration service ``DescribeDomains`` action. The domain endpoints are also displayed on the domain dashboard in the Amazon CloudSearch console. You submit suggest requests to the search endpoint.

   

  For more information, see the `Amazon CloudSearch Developer Guide <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/latest/developerguide>`__.
