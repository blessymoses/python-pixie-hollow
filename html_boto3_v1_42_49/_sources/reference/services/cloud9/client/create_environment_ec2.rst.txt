  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.create_environment_ec2(
        name='string',
        description='string',
        clientRequestToken='string',
        instanceType='string',
        subnetId='string',
        imageId='string',
        automaticStopTimeMinutes=123,
        ownerArn='string',
        tags=[
            {
                'Key': 'string',
                'Value': 'string'
            },
        ],
        connectionType='CONNECT_SSH'|'CONNECT_SSM',
        dryRun=True|False
    )
    
  :type name: string
  :param name: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of the environment to create.

     

    This name is visible to other IAM users in the same Amazon Web Services account.

    

  
  :type description: string
  :param description: 

    The description of the environment to create.

    

  
  :type clientRequestToken: string
  :param clientRequestToken: 

    A unique, case-sensitive string that helps Cloud9 to ensure this operation completes no more than one time.

     

    For more information, see `Client Tokens <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Run_Instance_Idempotency.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 API Reference*.

    

  
  :type instanceType: string
  :param instanceType: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The type of instance to connect to the environment (for example, ``t2.micro``).

    

  
  :type subnetId: string
  :param subnetId: 

    The ID of the subnet in Amazon VPC that Cloud9 will use to communicate with the Amazon EC2 instance.

    

  
  :type imageId: string
  :param imageId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The identifier for the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that's used to create the EC2 instance. To choose an AMI for the instance, you must specify a valid AMI alias or a valid Amazon EC2 Systems Manager (SSM) path.

     

    

     

    We recommend using Amazon Linux 2023 as the AMI to create your environment as it is fully supported.

     

    From December 16, 2024, Ubuntu 18.04 will be removed from the list of available ``imageIds`` for Cloud9. This change is necessary as Ubuntu 18.04 has ended standard support on May 31, 2023. This change will only affect direct API consumers, and not Cloud9 console users.

     

    Since Ubuntu 18.04 has ended standard support as of May 31, 2023, we recommend you choose Ubuntu 22.04.

     

    **AMI aliases**

     

    
    * Amazon Linux 2: ``amazonlinux-2-x86_64``

  :type automaticStopTimeMinutes: integer
  :param automaticStopTimeMinutes: 

    The number of minutes until the running instance is shut down after the environment has last been used.

    

  
  :type ownerArn: string
  :param ownerArn:

      Metadata that is associated with Amazon Web Services resources. In particular, a name-value pair that can be associated with an Cloud9 development environment. There are two types of tags: *user tags* and *system tags*. A user tag is created by the user. A system tag is automatically created by Amazon Web Services services. A system tag is prefixed with ``"aws:"`` and cannot be modified by the user.

      

    
      - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The **name** part of a tag.

  :type dryRun: boolean
  :param dryRun: 

    Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is ``DryRunOperation``. Otherwise, it is ``UnauthorizedOperation``.
