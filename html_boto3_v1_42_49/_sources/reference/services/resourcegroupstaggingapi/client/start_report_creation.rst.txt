.. py:method:: ResourceGroupsTaggingAPI.Client.start_report_creation(**kwargs)

  

  Generates a report that lists all tagged resources in the accounts across your organization and tells whether each resource is compliant with the effective tag policy. Compliance data is refreshed daily. The report is generated asynchronously.

   

  The generated report is saved to the following location:

   

  ``s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/AwsTagPolicies/o-exampleorgid/YYYY-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ/report.csv``

   

  For more information about evaluating resource compliance with tag policies, including the required permissions, review `Permissions for evaluating organization-wide compliance <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/tag-editor/latest/userguide/tag-policies-orgs.html#tag-policies-permissions-org>`__ in the *Tagging Amazon Web Services Resources and Tag Editor* user guide.

   

  You can call this operation only from the organization's management account and from the us-east-1 Region.

   

  If the account associated with the identity used to call ``StartReportCreation`` is different from the account that owns the Amazon S3 bucket, there must be a bucket policy attached to the bucket to provide access. For more information, review `Amazon S3 bucket policy for report storage <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/tag-editor/latest/userguide/tag-policies-orgs.html#bucket-policy>`__ in the *Tagging Amazon Web Services Resources and Tag Editor* user guide.
