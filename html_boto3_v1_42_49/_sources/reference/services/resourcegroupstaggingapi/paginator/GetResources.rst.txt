      response_iterator = paginator.paginate(
          TagFilters=[
              {
                  'Key': 'string',

              },
          ],

              'string',
          ],

          ExcludeCompliantResources=True|False,
          ResourceARNList=[
              'string',
          ],
          PaginationConfig={
              'MaxItems': 123,
              'PageSize': 123,
              'StartingToken': 'string'
          }
      )
      
    :type TagFilters: list
    :param TagFilters: 

      Specifies a list of TagFilters (keys and values) to restrict the output to only those resources that have tags with the specified keys and, if included, the specified values. Each ``TagFilter`` must contain a key with values optional. A request can include up to 50 keys, and each key can include up to 20 values.

       

      You can't specify both this parameter and the ``ResourceArnList`` parameter in the same request. If you do, you get an ``Invalid Parameter`` exception.

       

      Note the following when deciding how to use TagFilters:

       

      
      * If you *don't* specify a ``TagFilter``, the response includes all resources that are currently tagged or ever had a tag. Resources that were previously tagged, *but do not currently* have tags, are shown with an empty tag set, like this: ``"Tags": []``.
       
      * If you specify more than one filter in a single request, the response returns only those resources that satisfy all filters.
       
      * If you specify a filter that contains more than one value for a key, the response returns resources that match *any* of the specified values for that key.
       
      * If you don't specify a value for a key, the response returns all resources that are tagged with that key, with any or no value. For example, for the following filters: ``filter1= {key1,{value1}}``, ``filter2={key2,{value2,value3,value4}}``, ``filter3= {key3}``: 

        
        * ``GetResources({filter1})`` returns resources tagged with ``key1=value1``
         
        * ``GetResources({filter2})`` returns resources tagged with ``key2=value2`` or ``key2=value3`` or ``key2=value4``
         
        * ``GetResources({filter3})`` returns resources tagged with any tag with the key ``key3``, and with any or no value
         
        * ``GetResources({filter1,filter2,filter3})`` returns resources tagged with ``(key1=value1) and (key2=value2 or key2=value3 or key2=value4) and (key3, any or no value)``
        

      
      

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        A list of tags (keys and values) that are used to specify the associated resources.

        

      
        - **Key** *(string) --* 

          One part of a key-value pair that makes up a tag. A key is a general label that acts like a category for more specific tag values.

          

        
        - **Values** *(list) --* 

          One part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key). The value can be empty or null.

          

        
          - *(string) --* 

          
      
      
  
    :type TagsPerPage: integer
    :param TagsPerPage: 

      Amazon Web Services recommends using ``ResourcesPerPage`` instead of this parameter.

       

      A limit that restricts the number of tags (key and value pairs) returned by ``GetResources`` in paginated output. A resource with no tags is counted as having one tag (one key and value pair).

       

      ``GetResources`` does not split a resource and its associated tags across pages. If the specified ``TagsPerPage`` would cause such a break, a ``PaginationToken`` is returned in place of the affected resource and its tags. Use that token in another request to get the remaining data. For example, if you specify a ``TagsPerPage`` of ``100`` and the account has 22 resources with 10 tags each (meaning that each resource has 10 key and value pairs), the output will consist of three pages. The first page displays the first 10 resources, each with its 10 tags. The second page displays the next 10 resources, each with its 10 tags. The third page displays the remaining 2 resources, each with its 10 tags.

       

      You can set ``TagsPerPage`` to a minimum of 100 items up to a maximum of 500 items.

      

    
    :type ResourceTypeFilters: list
    :param ResourceTypeFilters: 

      Specifies the resource types that you want included in the response. The format of each resource type is ``service[:resourceType]``. For example, specifying a service of ``ec2`` returns all Amazon EC2 resources (which includes EC2 instances). Specifying a resource type of ``ec2:instance`` returns only EC2 instances.

       

      You can't specify both this parameter and the ``ResourceArnList`` parameter in the same request. If you do, you get an ``Invalid Parameter`` exception.

       

      The string for each service name and resource type is the same as that embedded in a resource's Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

       

      .. note::

        

        For the list of services whose resources you can tag using the Resource Groups Tagging API, see `Services that support the Resource Groups Tagging API <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resourcegroupstagging/latest/APIReference/supported-services.html>`__. If an Amazon Web Services service isn't listed on that page, you might still be able to tag that service's resources by using that service's native tagging operations instead of using Resource Groups Tagging API operations. All tagged resources, whether the tagging used the Resource Groups Tagging API or not, are returned by the ``Get*`` operation.

        

       

      You can specify multiple resource types by using an array. The array can include up to 100 items. Note that the length constraint requirement applies to each resource type filter. For example, the following string would limit the response to only Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon S3 buckets, or any Audit Manager resource:

       

      ``ec2:instance,s3:bucket,auditmanager``

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type IncludeComplianceDetails: boolean
    :param IncludeComplianceDetails: 

      Specifies whether to include details regarding the compliance with the effective tag policy. Set this to ``true`` to determine whether resources are compliant with the tag policy and to get details.

      

    
    :type ExcludeCompliantResources: boolean
    :param ExcludeCompliantResources: 

      Specifies whether to exclude resources that are compliant with the tag policy. Set this to ``true`` if you are interested in retrieving information on noncompliant resources only.

       

      You can use this parameter only if the ``IncludeComplianceDetails`` parameter is also set to ``true``.

      

    
    :type ResourceARNList: list
    :param ResourceARNList: 

      Specifies a list of ARNs of resources for which you want to retrieve tag data.

       

      You can't specify both this parameter and the ``ResourceTypeFilters`` parameter in the same request. If you do, you get an ``Invalid Parameter`` exception.

       

      You can't specify both this parameter and the ``TagFilters`` parameter in the same request. If you do, you get an ``Invalid Parameter`` exception.

       

      You can't specify both this parameter and any of the pagination parameters ( ``ResourcesPerPage``, ``TagsPerPage``, ``PaginationToken``) in the same request. If you do, you get an ``Invalid Parameter`` exception.

       

      If a resource specified by this parameter doesn't exist, it doesn't generate an error; it simply isn't included in the response.

       

      An ARN (Amazon Resource Name) uniquely identifies a resource. For more information, see `Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and Amazon Web Services Service Namespaces <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type PaginationConfig: dict
    :param PaginationConfig: 

      A dictionary that provides parameters to control pagination.

      

    
      - **MaxItems** *(integer) --* 

        The total number of items to return. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified in max-items then a ``NextToken`` will be provided in the output that you can use to resume pagination.

        

      
      - **PageSize** *(integer) --* 

        The size of each page.

        

      
      - **StartingToken** *(string) --* 

        A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previous response.
