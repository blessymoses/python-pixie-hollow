.. py:method:: ManagedGrafana.Client.create_workspace(**kwargs)

  

  Creates a *workspace*. In a workspace, you can create Grafana dashboards and visualizations to analyze your metrics, logs, and traces. You don't have to build, package, or deploy any hardware to run the Grafana server.

   

  Don't use ``CreateWorkspace`` to modify an existing workspace. Instead, use `UpdateWorkspace <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/grafana/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateWorkspace.html>`__.

    )
    
  :type accountAccessType: string
  :param accountAccessType: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies whether the workspace can access Amazon Web Services resources in this Amazon Web Services account only, or whether it can also access Amazon Web Services resources in other accounts in the same organization. If you specify ``ORGANIZATION``, you must specify which organizational units the workspace can access in the ``workspaceOrganizationalUnits`` parameter.

    

  
  :type authenticationProviders: list
  :param authenticationProviders: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies whether this workspace uses SAML 2.0, IAM Identity Center, or both to authenticate users for using the Grafana console within a workspace. For more information, see `User authentication in Amazon Managed Grafana <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/grafana/latest/userguide/authentication-in-AMG.html>`__.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type clientToken: string

    A unique, case-sensitive, user-provided identifier to ensure the idempotency of the request.

    This field is autopopulated if not provided.

  
  :type configuration: string
  :param configuration: 

    The configuration string for the workspace that you create. For more information about the format and configuration options available, see `Working in your Grafana workspace <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/grafana/latest/userguide/AMG-configure-workspace.html>`__.

    

  
  :type grafanaVersion: string
  :param grafanaVersion: 

    Specifies the version of Grafana to support in the new workspace. If not specified, defaults to the latest version (for example, 10.4).

     

    To get a list of supported versions, use the ``ListVersions`` operation.

    

  
  :type networkAccessControl: dict
  :param networkAccessControl: 

    Configuration for network access to your workspace.

     

    When this is configured, only listed IP addresses and VPC endpoints will be able to access your workspace. Standard Grafana authentication and authorization will still be required.

     

    If this is not configured, or is removed, then all IP addresses and VPC endpoints will be allowed. Standard Grafana authentication and authorization will still be required.

    

  
    - **prefixListIds** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      An array of prefix list IDs. A prefix list is a list of CIDR ranges of IP addresses. The IP addresses specified are allowed to access your workspace. If the list is not included in the configuration (passed an empty array) then no IP addresses are allowed to access the workspace. You create a prefix list using the Amazon VPC console.

       

      Prefix list IDs have the format ``pl-1a2b3c4d ``.

       

      For more information about prefix lists, see `Group CIDR blocks using managed prefix lists <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/managed-prefix-lists.html>`__in the *Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide*.

If a ``NetworkAccessConfiguration`` is specified then only VPC endpoints specified here are allowed to access the workspace. If you pass in an empty array of strings, then no VPCs are allowed to access the workspace.

       

      VPC endpoint IDs have the format ``vpce-1a2b3c4d ``.

       

      For more information about creating an interface VPC endpoint, see `Interface VPC endpoints <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/grafana/latest/userguide/VPC-endpoints>`__ in the *Amazon Managed Grafana User Guide*.

       

      .. note::

        

        The only VPC endpoints that can be specified here are interface VPC endpoints for Grafana workspaces (using the ``com.amazonaws.[region].grafana-workspace`` service endpoint). Other VPC endpoints are ignored.

        

      

    
      - *(string) --*

  :type permissionType: string
  :param permissionType: **[REQUIRED]** 

    When creating a workspace through the Amazon Web Services API, CLI or Amazon Web Services CloudFormation, you must manage IAM roles and provision the permissions that the workspace needs to use Amazon Web Services data sources and notification channels.

     

    You must also specify a ``workspaceRoleArn`` for a role that you will manage for the workspace to use when accessing those datasources and notification channels.

     

    The ability for Amazon Managed Grafana to create and update IAM roles on behalf of the user is supported only in the Amazon Managed Grafana console, where this value may be set to ``SERVICE_MANAGED``.

     

    .. note::

      

      Use only the ``CUSTOMER_MANAGED`` permission type when creating a workspace with the API, CLI or Amazon Web Services CloudFormation.

      

     

    For more information, see `Amazon Managed Grafana permissions and policies for Amazon Web Services data sources and notification channels <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/grafana/latest/userguide/AMG-manage-permissions.html>`__.

    

  
  :type stackSetName: string
  :param stackSetName: 

    The name of the CloudFormation stack set to use to generate IAM roles to be used for this workspace.

    

  
  :type tags: dict

  :type workspaceOrganizationalUnits: list
  :param workspaceOrganizationalUnits: 

    Specifies the organizational units that this workspace is allowed to use data sources from, if this workspace is in an account that is part of an organization.

          - *(string) --* 
      
        

        - **permissionType** *(string) --* 

          If this is ``SERVICE_MANAGED``, and the workplace was created through the Amazon Managed Grafana console, then Amazon Managed Grafana automatically creates the IAM roles and provisions the permissions that the workspace needs to use Amazon Web Services data sources and notification channels.

           

          If this is ``CUSTOMER_MANAGED``, you must manage those roles and permissions yourself.

           

          If you are working with a workspace in a member account of an organization and that account is not a delegated administrator account, and you want the workspace to access data sources in other Amazon Web Services accounts in the organization, this parameter must be set to ``CUSTOMER_MANAGED``.
