.. py:method:: ForecastService.Client.delete_resource_tree(**kwargs)

  

  Deletes an entire resource tree. This operation will delete the parent resource and its child resources.

   

  Child resources are resources that were created from another resource. For example, when a forecast is generated from a predictor, the forecast is the child resource and the predictor is the parent resource.

   

  Amazon Forecast resources possess the following parent-child resource hierarchies:

   

  
  * **Dataset**: dataset import jobs
   
  * **Dataset Group**: predictors, predictor backtest export jobs, forecasts, forecast export jobs
   
  * **Predictor**: predictor backtest export jobs, forecasts, forecast export jobs
   
  * **Forecast**: forecast export jobs
  

   

  .. note::

    

    ``DeleteResourceTree`` will only delete Amazon Forecast resources, and will not delete datasets or exported files stored in Amazon S3.
