.. py:method:: ForecastService.Client.create_dataset_group(**kwargs)

  

  Creates a dataset group, which holds a collection of related datasets. You can add datasets to the dataset group when you create the dataset group, or later by using the `UpdateDatasetGroup <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forecast/latest/dg/API_UpdateDatasetGroup.html>`__ operation.

   

  After creating a dataset group and adding datasets, you use the dataset group when you create a predictor. For more information, see `Dataset groups <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forecast/latest/dg/howitworks-datasets-groups.html>`__.

   

  To get a list of all your datasets groups, use the `ListDatasetGroups <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forecast/latest/dg/API_ListDatasetGroups.html>`__ operation.

   

  .. note::

    

    The ``Status`` of a dataset group must be ``ACTIVE`` before you can use the dataset group to create a predictor. To get the status, use the `DescribeDatasetGroup <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forecast/latest/dg/API_DescribeDatasetGroup.html>`__ operation.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.create_dataset_group(
        DatasetGroupName='string',
        Domain='RETAIL'|'CUSTOM'|'INVENTORY_PLANNING'|'EC2_CAPACITY'|'WORK_FORCE'|'WEB_TRAFFIC'|'METRICS',
        DatasetArns=[
            'string',

            {
                'Key': 'string',
                'Value': 'string'
            },
        ]
    )
    
  :type DatasetGroupName: string
  :param DatasetGroupName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A name for the dataset group.

    

  
  :type Domain: string
  :param Domain: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The domain associated with the dataset group. When you add a dataset to a dataset group, this value and the value specified for the ``Domain`` parameter of the `CreateDataset <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forecast/latest/dg/API_CreateDataset.html>`__ operation must match.

     

    The ``Domain`` and ``DatasetType`` that you choose determine the fields that must be present in training data that you import to a dataset. For example, if you choose the ``RETAIL`` domain and ``TARGET_TIME_SERIES`` as the ``DatasetType``, Amazon Forecast requires that ``item_id``, ``timestamp``, and ``demand`` fields are present in your data. For more information, see `Dataset groups <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forecast/latest/dg/howitworks-datasets-groups.html>`__.

    

  
  :type DatasetArns: list
  :param DatasetArns: 

    An array of Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the datasets that you want to include in the dataset group.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type Tags: list
  :param Tags: 

    The optional metadata that you apply to the dataset group to help you categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define.

     

    The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

     

    
    * Maximum number of tags per resource - 50.
     
    * For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value.
     
    * Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.
     
    * Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.
     
    * If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.
     
    * Tag keys and values are case sensitive.
     
    * Do not use ``aws:``, ``AWS:``, or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for keys as it is reserved for Amazon Web Services use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys with this prefix. Values can have this prefix. If a tag value has ``aws`` as its prefix but the key does not, then Forecast considers it to be a user tag and will count against the limit of 50 tags. Tags with only the key prefix of ``aws`` do not count against your tags per resource limit.

      - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        One part of a key-value pair that makes up a tag. A ``key`` is a general label that acts like a category for more specific tag values.

        

      
      - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The optional part of a key-value pair that makes up a tag. A ``value`` acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).
