.. py:method:: ForecastService.Client.create_explainability(**kwargs)

  

  .. note::

    

    Explainability is only available for Forecasts and Predictors generated from an AutoPredictor (  CreateAutoPredictor)

    

   

  Creates an Amazon Forecast Explainability.

   

  Explainability helps you better understand how the attributes in your datasets impact forecast. Amazon Forecast uses a metric called Impact scores to quantify the relative impact of each attribute and determine whether they increase or decrease forecast values.

   

  To enable Forecast Explainability, your predictor must include at least one of the following: related time series, item metadata, or additional datasets like Holidays and the Weather Index.

   

  CreateExplainability accepts either a Predictor ARN or Forecast ARN. To receive aggregated Impact scores for all time series and time points in your datasets, provide a Predictor ARN. To receive Impact scores for specific time series and time points, provide a Forecast ARN.

   

  **CreateExplainability with a Predictor ARN**

   

  .. note::

    

    You can only have one Explainability resource per predictor. If you already enabled ``ExplainPredictor`` in  CreateAutoPredictor, that predictor already has an Explainability resource.

    

   

  The following parameters are required when providing a Predictor ARN:

   

  
  * ``ExplainabilityName`` - A unique name for the Explainability.
   
  * ``ResourceArn`` - The Arn of the predictor.
   
  * ``TimePointGranularity`` - Must be set to “ALL”.
   
  * ``TimeSeriesGranularity`` - Must be set to “ALL”.
  

   

  Do not specify a value for the following parameters:

   

  
  * ``DataSource`` - Only valid when TimeSeriesGranularity is “SPECIFIC”.
   
  * ``Schema`` - Only valid when TimeSeriesGranularity is “SPECIFIC”.
   
  * ``StartDateTime`` - Only valid when TimePointGranularity is “SPECIFIC”.
   
  * ``EndDateTime`` - Only valid when TimePointGranularity is “SPECIFIC”.
  

   

  **CreateExplainability with a Forecast ARN**

   

  .. note::

    

    You can specify a maximum of 50 time series and 500 time points.

    

   

  The following parameters are required when providing a Predictor ARN:

   

  
  * ``ExplainabilityName`` - A unique name for the Explainability.
   
  * ``ResourceArn`` - The Arn of the forecast.
   
  * ``TimePointGranularity`` - Either “ALL” or “SPECIFIC”.
   
  * ``TimeSeriesGranularity`` - Either “ALL” or “SPECIFIC”.
  

   

  If you set TimeSeriesGranularity to “SPECIFIC”, you must also provide the following:

   

  
  * ``DataSource`` - The S3 location of the CSV file specifying your time series.
   
  * ``Schema`` - The Schema defines the attributes and attribute types listed in the Data Source.
  

   

  If you set TimePointGranularity to “SPECIFIC”, you must also provide the following:

   

  
  * ``StartDateTime`` - The first timestamp in the range of time points.
   
  * ``EndDateTime`` - The last timestamp in the range of time points.

    - **S3Config** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The path to the data stored in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket along with the credentials to access the data.

  :type Tags: list
  :param Tags: 

    Optional metadata to help you categorize and organize your resources. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. Tag keys and values are case sensitive.

     

    The following restrictions apply to tags:

     

    
    * For each resource, each tag key must be unique and each tag key must have one value.
     
    * Maximum number of tags per resource: 50.
     
    * Maximum key length: 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.
     
    * Maximum value length: 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.
     
    * Accepted characters: all letters and numbers, spaces representable in UTF-8, and + - = . _ : / @. If your tagging schema is used across other services and resources, the character restrictions of those services also apply.
     
    * Key prefixes cannot include any upper or lowercase combination of ``aws:`` or ``AWS:``. Values can have this prefix. If a tag value has ``aws`` as its prefix but the key does not, Forecast considers it to be a user tag and will count against the limit of 50 tags. Tags with only the key prefix of ``aws`` do not count against your tags per resource limit. You cannot edit or delete tag keys with this prefix.
    

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      The optional metadata that you apply to a resource to help you categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define.

       

      The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

       

      
      * Maximum number of tags per resource - 50.
       
      * For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value.
       
      * Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.
       
      * Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.
       
      * If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.
       
      * Tag keys and values are case sensitive.
       
      * Do not use ``aws:``, ``AWS:``, or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for keys as it is reserved for Amazon Web Services use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys with this prefix. Values can have this prefix. If a tag value has ``aws`` as its prefix but the key does not, then Forecast considers it to be a user tag and will count against the limit of 50 tags. Tags with only the key prefix of ``aws`` do not count against your tags per resource limit.
      

      

    
      - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        One part of a key-value pair that makes up a tag. A ``key`` is a general label that acts like a category for more specific tag values.

        

      
      - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The optional part of a key-value pair that makes up a tag. A ``value`` acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).
