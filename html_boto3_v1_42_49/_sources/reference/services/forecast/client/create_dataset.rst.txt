.. py:method:: ForecastService.Client.create_dataset(**kwargs)

  

  Creates an Amazon Forecast dataset. The information about the dataset that you provide helps Forecast understand how to consume the data for model training. This includes the following:

   

  
  * ``DataFrequency`` - How frequently your historical time-series data is collected.
   
  * ``Domain`` and ``DatasetType`` - Each dataset has an associated dataset domain and a type within the domain. Amazon Forecast provides a list of predefined domains and types within each domain. For each unique dataset domain and type within the domain, Amazon Forecast requires your data to include a minimum set of predefined fields.
   
  * ``Schema`` - A schema specifies the fields in the dataset, including the field name and data type.
  

   

  After creating a dataset, you import your training data into it and add the dataset to a dataset group. You use the dataset group to create a predictor. For more information, see `Importing datasets <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forecast/latest/dg/howitworks-datasets-groups.html>`__.

   

  To get a list of all your datasets, use the `ListDatasets <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forecast/latest/dg/API_ListDatasets.html>`__ operation.

   

  For example Forecast datasets, see the `Amazon Forecast Sample GitHub repository <https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-forecast-samples>`__.

   

  .. note::

    

    The ``Status`` of a dataset must be ``ACTIVE`` before you can import training data. Use the `DescribeDataset <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forecast/latest/dg/API_DescribeDataset.html>`__ operation to get the status.

    response = client.create_dataset(
        DatasetName='string',
        Domain='RETAIL'|'CUSTOM'|'INVENTORY_PLANNING'|'EC2_CAPACITY'|'WORK_FORCE'|'WEB_TRAFFIC'|'METRICS',
        DatasetType='TARGET_TIME_SERIES'|'RELATED_TIME_SERIES'|'ITEM_METADATA',
        DataFrequency='string',
        Schema={
            'Attributes': [
                {
                    'AttributeName': 'string',
                    'AttributeType': 'string'|'integer'|'float'|'timestamp'|'geolocation'
                },

                'Key': 'string',
                'Value': 'string'
            },
        ]
    )
    
  :type DatasetName: string
  :param DatasetName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A name for the dataset.

    

  
  :type Domain: string
  :param Domain: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The domain associated with the dataset. When you add a dataset to a dataset group, this value and the value specified for the ``Domain`` parameter of the `CreateDatasetGroup <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forecast/latest/dg/API_CreateDatasetGroup.html>`__ operation must match.

     

    The ``Domain`` and ``DatasetType`` that you choose determine the fields that must be present in the training data that you import to the dataset. For example, if you choose the ``RETAIL`` domain and ``TARGET_TIME_SERIES`` as the ``DatasetType``, Amazon Forecast requires ``item_id``, ``timestamp``, and ``demand`` fields to be present in your data. For more information, see `Importing datasets <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forecast/latest/dg/howitworks-datasets-groups.html>`__.

    

  
  :type DatasetType: string
  :param DatasetType: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The dataset type. Valid values depend on the chosen ``Domain``.

    

  
  :type DataFrequency: string
  :param DataFrequency: 

    The frequency of data collection. This parameter is required for RELATED_TIME_SERIES datasets.

     

    Valid intervals are an integer followed by Y (Year), M (Month), W (Week), D (Day), H (Hour), and min (Minute). For example, "1D" indicates every day and "15min" indicates every 15 minutes. You cannot specify a value that would overlap with the next larger frequency. That means, for example, you cannot specify a frequency of 60 minutes, because that is equivalent to 1 hour. The valid values for each frequency are the following:

     

    
    * Minute - 1-59
     
    * Hour - 1-23
     
    * Day - 1-6
     
    * Week - 1-4
     
    * Month - 1-11
     
    * Year - 1
    

     

    Thus, if you want every other week forecasts, specify "2W". Or, if you want quarterly forecasts, you specify "3M".

    

  
  :type Schema: dict
  :param Schema: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The schema for the dataset. The schema attributes and their order must match the fields in your data. The dataset ``Domain`` and ``DatasetType`` that you choose determine the minimum required fields in your training data. For information about the required fields for a specific dataset domain and type, see `Dataset Domains and Dataset Types <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forecast/latest/dg/howitworks-domains-ds-types.html>`__.

    

  
    - **Attributes** *(list) --* 

      An array of attributes specifying the name and type of each field in a dataset.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        An attribute of a schema, which defines a dataset field. A schema attribute is required for every field in a dataset. The `Schema <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forecast/latest/dg/API_Schema.html>`__ object contains an array of ``SchemaAttribute`` objects.

        

      
        - **AttributeName** *(string) --* 

          The name of the dataset field.

          

        
        - **AttributeType** *(string) --* 

          The data type of the field.

           

          For a related time series dataset, other than date, item_id, and forecast dimensions attributes, all attributes should be of numerical type (integer/float).

          

        
      
  
  
  :type EncryptionConfig: dict
  :param EncryptionConfig: 

    An Key Management Service (KMS) key and the Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that Amazon Forecast can assume to access the key.

    

  
    - **RoleArn** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The ARN of the IAM role that Amazon Forecast can assume to access the KMS key.

       

      Passing a role across Amazon Web Services accounts is not allowed. If you pass a role that isn't in your account, you get an ``InvalidInputException`` error.

      

    
    - **KMSKeyArn** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the KMS key.

      

    
  
  :type Tags: list
  :param Tags: 

    The optional metadata that you apply to the dataset to help you categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define.

     

    The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

     

    
    * Maximum number of tags per resource - 50.
     
    * For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value.
     
    * Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.
     
    * Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.
     
    * If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.
     
    * Tag keys and values are case sensitive.
     
    * Do not use ``aws:``, ``AWS:``, or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for keys as it is reserved for Amazon Web Services use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys with this prefix. Values can have this prefix. If a tag value has ``aws`` as its prefix but the key does not, then Forecast considers it to be a user tag and will count against the limit of 50 tags. Tags with only the key prefix of ``aws`` do not count against your tags per resource limit.

      - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        One part of a key-value pair that makes up a tag. A ``key`` is a general label that acts like a category for more specific tag values.

        

      
      - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The optional part of a key-value pair that makes up a tag. A ``value`` acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).
