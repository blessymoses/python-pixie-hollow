          }
      )
      
    :type PaginationConfig: dict
    :param PaginationConfig: 

      A dictionary that provides parameters to control pagination.

      

    
      - **MaxItems** *(integer) --* 

        The total number of items to return. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified in max-items then a ``NextToken`` will be provided in the output that you can use to resume pagination.

        

      
      - **PageSize** *(integer) --* 

        The size of each page.

        

      
      - **StartingToken** *(string) --* 

        A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previous response.

      **Response Structure**

      

      - *(dict) --* 
        

        - **deliverySources** *(list) --* 

          An array of structures. Each structure contains information about one delivery source in the account.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            This structure contains information about one *delivery source* in your account. A delivery source is an Amazon Web Services resource that sends logs to an Amazon Web Services destination. The destination can be CloudWatch Logs, Amazon S3, or Firehose.

             

            Only some Amazon Web Services services support being configured as a delivery source. These services are listed as **Supported [V2 Permissions]** in the table at `Enabling logging from Amazon Web Services services. <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/AWS-logs-and-resource-policy.html>`__

             

            To configure logs delivery between a supported Amazon Web Services service and a destination, you must do the following:

             

            
            * Create a delivery source, which is a logical object that represents the resource that is actually sending the logs. For more information, see `PutDeliverySource <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutDeliverySource.html>`__.
             
            * Create a *delivery destination*, which is a logical object that represents the actual delivery destination. For more information, see `PutDeliveryDestination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutDeliveryDestination.html>`__.
             
            * If you are delivering logs cross-account, you must use `PutDeliveryDestinationPolicy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutDeliveryDestinationPolicy.html>`__ in the destination account to assign an IAM policy to the destination. This policy allows delivery to that destination.
             
            * Create a *delivery* by pairing exactly one delivery source and one delivery destination. For more information, see `CreateDelivery <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDelivery.html>`__.
            

             

            You can configure a single delivery source to send logs to multiple destinations by creating multiple deliveries. You can also create multiple deliveries to configure multiple delivery sources to send logs to the same delivery destination.

            
            

            - **name** *(string) --*

            - **resourceArns** *(list) --* 

              This array contains the ARN of the Amazon Web Services resource that sends logs and is represented by this delivery source. Currently, only one ARN can be in the array.

              
              

              - *(string) --*
