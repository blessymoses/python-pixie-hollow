.. py:method:: CloudWatchLogs.Client.describe_log_streams(**kwargs)

  

  Lists the log streams for the specified log group. You can list all the log streams or filter the results by prefix. You can also control how the results are ordered.

   

  You can specify the log group to search by using either ``logGroupIdentifier`` or ``logGroupName``. You must include one of these two parameters, but you can't include both.

   

  This operation has a limit of 25 transactions per second, after which transactions are throttled.

   

  If you are using CloudWatch cross-account observability, you can use this operation in a monitoring account and view data from the linked source accounts. For more information, see `CloudWatch cross-account observability <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Unified-Cross-Account.html>`__.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.describe_log_streams(
        logGroupName='string',
        logGroupIdentifier='string',
        logStreamNamePrefix='string',
        orderBy='LogStreamName'|'LastEventTime',
        descending=True|False,
        nextToken='string',
        limit=123
    )
    
  :type logGroupName: string
  :param logGroupName: 

    The name of the log group.

     

    .. note::

      

      You must include either ``logGroupIdentifier`` or ``logGroupName``, but not both.

      

    

  
  :type logGroupIdentifier: string
  :param logGroupIdentifier: 

    Specify either the name or ARN of the log group to view. If the log group is in a source account and you are using a monitoring account, you must use the log group ARN.

     

    .. note::

      

      You must include either ``logGroupIdentifier`` or ``logGroupName``, but not both.

      

    

  
  :type logStreamNamePrefix: string
  :param logStreamNamePrefix: 

    The prefix to match.

     

    If ``orderBy`` is ``LastEventTime``, you cannot specify this parameter.

    

  
  :type orderBy: string
  :param orderBy: 

    If the value is ``LogStreamName``, the results are ordered by log stream name. If the value is ``LastEventTime``, the results are ordered by the event time. The default value is ``LogStreamName``.

     

    If you order the results by event time, you cannot specify the ``logStreamNamePrefix`` parameter.

     

    ``lastEventTimestamp`` represents the time of the most recent log event in the log stream in CloudWatch Logs. This number is expressed as the number of milliseconds after ``Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC``. ``lastEventTimestamp`` updates on an eventual consistency basis. It typically updates in less than an hour from ingestion, but in rare situations might take longer.

    

  
  :type descending: boolean
  :param descending: 

    If the value is true, results are returned in descending order. If the value is to false, results are returned in ascending order. The default value is false.

    

  
  :type nextToken: string
  :param nextToken: 

    The token for the next set of items to return. (You received this token from a previous call.)

    

  
  :type limit: integer
  :param limit: 

    The maximum number of items returned. If you don't specify a value, the default is up to 50 items.

    

  
  
  :rtype: dict
  :returns:

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **logStreams** *(list) --* 

        The log streams.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          Represents a log stream, which is a sequence of log events from a single emitter of logs.

          
          

          - **logStreamName** *(string) --* 

            The name of the log stream.

            
          

          - **creationTime** *(integer) --* 

            The creation time of the stream, expressed as the number of milliseconds after ``Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC``.

            
          

          - **firstEventTimestamp** *(integer) --* 

            The time of the first event, expressed as the number of milliseconds after ``Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC``.

            
          

          - **lastEventTimestamp** *(integer) --* 

            The time of the most recent log event in the log stream in CloudWatch Logs. This number is expressed as the number of milliseconds after ``Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC``. The ``lastEventTime`` value updates on an eventual consistency basis. It typically updates in less than an hour from ingestion, but in rare situations might take longer.

            
          

          - **lastIngestionTime** *(integer) --* 

            The ingestion time, expressed as the number of milliseconds after ``Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC`` The ``lastIngestionTime`` value updates on an eventual consistency basis. It typically updates in less than an hour after ingestion, but in rare situations might take longer.

            
          

          - **uploadSequenceToken** *(string) --* 

            The sequence token.

             

            .. warning::

               

              The sequence token is now ignored in ``PutLogEvents`` actions. ``PutLogEvents`` actions are always accepted regardless of receiving an invalid sequence token. You don't need to obtain ``uploadSequenceToken`` to use a ``PutLogEvents`` action.

              

            
          

          - **arn** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the log stream.

            
          

          - **storedBytes** *(integer) --* 

            The number of bytes stored.

             

            **Important:** As of June 17, 2019, this parameter is no longer supported for log streams, and is always reported as zero. This change applies only to log streams. The ``storedBytes`` parameter for log groups is not affected.

            
      
    
      

      - **nextToken** *(string) --* 

        The token for the next set of items to return. The token expires after 24 hours.
