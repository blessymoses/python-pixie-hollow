.. py:method:: CloudWatchLogs.Client.disassociate_kms_key(**kwargs)

  

  Disassociates the specified KMS key from the specified log group or from all CloudWatch Logs Insights query results in the account.

   

  When you use ``DisassociateKmsKey``, you specify either the ``logGroupName`` parameter or the ``resourceIdentifier`` parameter. You can't specify both of those parameters in the same operation.

   

  
  * Specify the ``logGroupName`` parameter to stop using the KMS key to encrypt future log events ingested and stored in the log group. Instead, they will be encrypted with the default CloudWatch Logs method. The log events that were ingested while the key was associated with the log group are still encrypted with that key. Therefore, CloudWatch Logs will need permissions for the key whenever that data is accessed.
   
  * Specify the ``resourceIdentifier`` parameter with the ``query-result`` resource to stop using the KMS key to encrypt the results of all future `StartQuery <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_StartQuery.html>`__ operations in the account. They will instead be encrypted with the default CloudWatch Logs method. The results from queries that ran while the key was associated with the account are still encrypted with that key. Therefore, CloudWatch Logs will need permissions for the key whenever that data is accessed.
  

   

  It can take up to 5 minutes for this operation to take effect.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.disassociate_kms_key(
        logGroupName='string',
        resourceIdentifier='string'
    )
    
  :type logGroupName: string
  :param logGroupName: 

    The name of the log group.

     

    In your ``DisassociateKmsKey`` operation, you must specify either the ``resourceIdentifier`` parameter or the ``logGroup`` parameter, but you can't specify both.

    

  
  :type resourceIdentifier: string
  :param resourceIdentifier: 

    Specifies the target for this operation. You must specify one of the following:

     

    
    * Specify the ARN of a log group to stop having CloudWatch Logs use the KMS key to encrypt log events that are ingested and stored by that log group. After you run this operation, CloudWatch Logs encrypts ingested log events with the default CloudWatch Logs method. The log group ARN must be in the following format. Replace *REGION* and *ACCOUNT_ID* with your Region and account ID. ``arn:aws:logs:REGION:ACCOUNT_ID:log-group:LOG_GROUP_NAME``
     
    * Specify the following ARN to stop using this key to encrypt the results of future `StartQuery <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_StartQuery.html>`__ operations in this account. Replace *REGION* and *ACCOUNT_ID* with your Region and account ID. ``arn:aws:logs:REGION:ACCOUNT_ID:query-result:*``
    

     

    In your ``DisssociateKmsKey`` operation, you must specify either the ``resourceIdentifier`` parameter or the ``logGroup`` parameter, but you can't specify both.
