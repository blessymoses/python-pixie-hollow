    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **deliveryDestinations** *(list) --* 

        An array of structures. Each structure contains information about one delivery destination in the account.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          This structure contains information about one *delivery destination* in your account. A delivery destination is an Amazon Web Services resource that represents an Amazon Web Services service that logs can be sent to. CloudWatch Logs, Amazon S3, Firehose, and X-Ray are supported as delivery destinations.

           

          To configure logs delivery between a supported Amazon Web Services service and a destination, you must do the following:

           

          
          * Create a delivery source, which is a logical object that represents the resource that is actually sending the logs. For more information, see `PutDeliverySource <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutDeliverySource.html>`__.
           
          * Create a *delivery destination*, which is a logical object that represents the actual delivery destination.
           
          * If you are delivering logs cross-account, you must use `PutDeliveryDestinationPolicy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutDeliveryDestinationPolicy.html>`__ in the destination account to assign an IAM policy to the destination. This policy allows delivery to that destination.
           
          * Create a *delivery* by pairing exactly one delivery source and one delivery destination. For more information, see `CreateDelivery <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDelivery.html>`__.
          

           

          You can configure a single delivery source to send logs to multiple destinations by creating multiple deliveries. You can also create multiple deliveries to configure multiple delivery sources to send logs to the same delivery destination.
