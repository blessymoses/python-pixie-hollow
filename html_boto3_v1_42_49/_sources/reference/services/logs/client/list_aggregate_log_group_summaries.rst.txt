.. py:method:: CloudWatchLogs.Client.list_aggregate_log_group_summaries(**kwargs)

  

  Returns an aggregate summary of all log groups in the Region grouped by specified data source characteristics. Supports optional filtering by log group class, name patterns, and data sources. If you perform this action in a monitoring account, you can also return aggregated summaries of log groups from source accounts that are linked to the monitoring account. For more information about using cross-account observability to set up monitoring accounts and source accounts, see `CloudWatch cross-account observability <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Unified-Cross-Account.html>`__.

   

  The operation aggregates log groups by data source name and type and optionally format, providing counts of log groups that share these characteristics. The operation paginates results. By default, it returns up to 50 results and includes a token to retrieve more results.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_aggregate_log_group_summaries(
        accountIdentifiers=[
            'string',
        ],
        includeLinkedAccounts=True|False,
        logGroupClass='STANDARD'|'INFREQUENT_ACCESS'|'DELIVERY',
        logGroupNamePattern='string',
        dataSources=[
            {
                'name': 'string',
                'type': 'string'
            },
        ],
        groupBy='DATA_SOURCE_NAME_TYPE_AND_FORMAT'|'DATA_SOURCE_NAME_AND_TYPE',
        nextToken='string',
        limit=123
    )
    
  :type accountIdentifiers: list
  :param accountIdentifiers: 

    When ``includeLinkedAccounts`` is set to ``true``, use this parameter to specify the list of accounts to search. You can specify as many as 20 account IDs in the array.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type includeLinkedAccounts: boolean
  :param includeLinkedAccounts: 

    If you are using a monitoring account, set this to ``true`` to have the operation return log groups in the accounts listed in ``accountIdentifiers``.

     

    If this parameter is set to ``true`` and ``accountIdentifiers`` contains a null value, the operation returns all log groups in the monitoring account and all log groups in all source accounts that are linked to the monitoring account.

     

    The default for this parameter is ``false``.

    

  
  :type logGroupClass: string
  :param logGroupClass: 

    Filters the results by log group class to include only log groups of the specified class.

    

  
  :type logGroupNamePattern: string
  :param logGroupNamePattern: 

    Use this parameter to limit the returned log groups to only those with names that match the pattern that you specify. This parameter is a regular expression that can match prefixes and substrings, and supports wildcard matching and matching multiple patterns, as in the following examples.

     

    
    * Use ``^`` to match log group names by prefix.
     
    * For a substring match, specify the string to match. All matches are case sensitive
     
    * To match multiple patterns, separate them with a ``|`` as in the example ``^/aws/lambda|discovery``
    

     

    You can specify as many as five different regular expression patterns in this field, each of which must be between 3 and 24 characters. You can include the ``^`` symbol as many as five times, and include the ``|`` symbol as many as four times.

    

  
  :type dataSources: list
  :param dataSources: 

    Filters the results by data source characteristics to include only log groups associated with the specified data sources.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      Filter criteria for data sources, used to specify which data sources to include in operations based on name and type.

      

    
      - **name** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The name pattern to filter data sources by.

        

      
      - **type** *(string) --* 

        The type pattern to filter data sources by.

        

      
    

  :type groupBy: string
  :param groupBy: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies how to group the log groups in the summary.

    

  
  :type nextToken: string
  :param nextToken: 

    The token for the next set of items to return. The token expires after 24 hours.

    

  
  :type limit: integer
  :param limit: 

    The maximum number of aggregated summaries to return. If you omit this parameter, the default is up to 50 aggregated summaries.

        - *(dict) --* 

          Contains an aggregate summary of log groups grouped by data source characteristics, including the count of log groups and their grouping identifiers.

          
          

          - **logGroupCount** *(integer) --*
