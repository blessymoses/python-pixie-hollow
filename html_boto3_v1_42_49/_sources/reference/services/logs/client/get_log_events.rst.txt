.. py:method:: CloudWatchLogs.Client.get_log_events(**kwargs)

  

  Lists log events from the specified log stream. You can list all of the log events or filter using a time range.

   

  ``GetLogEvents`` is a paginated operation. Each page returned can contain up to 1 MB of log events or up to 10,000 log events. A returned page might only be partially full, or even empty. For example, if the result of a query would return 15,000 log events, the first page isn't guaranteed to have 10,000 log events even if they all fit into 1 MB.

   

  Partially full or empty pages don't necessarily mean that pagination is finished. As long as the ``nextBackwardToken`` or ``nextForwardToken`` returned is NOT equal to the ``nextToken`` that you passed into the API call, there might be more log events available. The token that you use depends on the direction you want to move in along the log stream. The returned tokens are never null.

   

  .. note::

    

    If you set ``startFromHead`` to ``true`` and you don’t include ``endTime`` in your request, you can end up in a situation where the pagination doesn't terminate. This can happen when the new log events are being added to the target log streams faster than they are being read. This situation is a good use case for the CloudWatch Logs `Live Tail <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CloudWatchLogs_LiveTail.html>`__ feature.

    

   

  If you are using CloudWatch cross-account observability, you can use this operation in a monitoring account and view data from the linked source accounts. For more information, see `CloudWatch cross-account observability <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Unified-Cross-Account.html>`__.

   

  You can specify the log group to search by using either ``logGroupIdentifier`` or ``logGroupName``. You must include one of these two parameters, but you can't include both.

   

  .. note::

    

    If you are using `log transformation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CloudWatch-Logs-Transformation.html>`__, the ``GetLogEvents`` operation returns only the original versions of log events, before they were transformed. To view the transformed versions, you must use a `CloudWatch Logs query. <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/AnalyzingLogData.html>`__

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.get_log_events(
        logGroupName='string',
        logGroupIdentifier='string',
        logStreamName='string',
        startTime=123,
        endTime=123,
        nextToken='string',
        limit=123,
        startFromHead=True|False,
        unmask=True|False
    )
    
  :type logGroupName: string
  :param logGroupName: 

    The name of the log group.

     

    .. note::

      

      You must include either ``logGroupIdentifier`` or ``logGroupName``, but not both.

      

    

  
  :type logGroupIdentifier: string
  :param logGroupIdentifier: 

    Specify either the name or ARN of the log group to view events from. If the log group is in a source account and you are using a monitoring account, you must use the log group ARN.

     

    .. note::

      

      You must include either ``logGroupIdentifier`` or ``logGroupName``, but not both.

      

    

  
  :type logStreamName: string
  :param logStreamName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of the log stream.

    

  
  :type startTime: integer
  :param startTime: 

    The start of the time range, expressed as the number of milliseconds after ``Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC``. Events with a timestamp equal to this time or later than this time are included. Events with a timestamp earlier than this time are not included.

    

  
  :type endTime: integer
  :param endTime: 

    The end of the time range, expressed as the number of milliseconds after ``Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC``. Events with a timestamp equal to or later than this time are not included.

    

  
  :type nextToken: string
  :param nextToken: 

    The token for the next set of items to return. (You received this token from a previous call.)

    

  
  :type limit: integer
  :param limit: 

    The maximum number of log events returned. If you don't specify a limit, the default is as many log events as can fit in a response size of 1 MB (up to 10,000 log events).

    

  
  :type startFromHead: boolean
  :param startFromHead: 

    If the value is true, the earliest log events are returned first. If the value is false, the latest log events are returned first. The default value is false.

     

    If you are using a previous ``nextForwardToken`` value as the ``nextToken`` in this operation, you must specify ``true`` for ``startFromHead``.

    

  
  :type unmask: boolean
  :param unmask: 

    Specify ``true`` to display the log event fields with all sensitive data unmasked and visible. The default is ``false``.

     

    To use this operation with this parameter, you must be signed into an account with the ``logs:Unmask`` permission.
