.. py:method:: CloudWatchLogs.Client.put_subscription_filter(**kwargs)

  

  Creates or updates a subscription filter and associates it with the specified log group. With subscription filters, you can subscribe to a real-time stream of log events ingested through `PutLogEvents <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutLogEvents.html>`__ and have them delivered to a specific destination. When log events are sent to the receiving service, they are Base64 encoded and compressed with the GZIP format.

   

  The following destinations are supported for subscription filters:

   

  
  * An Amazon Kinesis data stream belonging to the same account as the subscription filter, for same-account delivery.
   
  * A logical destination created with `PutDestination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutDestination.html>`__ that belongs to a different account, for cross-account delivery. We currently support Kinesis Data Streams and Firehose as logical destinations.
   
  * An Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream that belongs to the same account as the subscription filter, for same-account delivery.
   
  * An Lambda function that belongs to the same account as the subscription filter, for same-account delivery.
  

   

  Each log group can have up to two subscription filters associated with it. If you are updating an existing filter, you must specify the correct name in ``filterName``.

   

  Using regular expressions in filter patterns is supported. For these filters, there is a quotas of quota of two regular expression patterns within a single filter pattern. There is also a quota of five regular expression patterns per log group. For more information about using regular expressions in filter patterns, see `Filter pattern syntax for metric filters, subscription filters, filter log events, and Live Tail <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/FilterAndPatternSyntax.html>`__.

   

  To perform a ``PutSubscriptionFilter`` operation for any destination except a Lambda function, you must also have the ``iam:PassRole`` permission.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.put_subscription_filter(
        logGroupName='string',
        filterName='string',
        filterPattern='string',
        destinationArn='string',
        roleArn='string',
        distribution='Random'|'ByLogStream',
        applyOnTransformedLogs=True|False,
        fieldSelectionCriteria='string',
        emitSystemFields=[
            'string',
        ]
    )
    
  :type logGroupName: string
  :param logGroupName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of the log group.

    

  
  :type filterName: string
  :param filterName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A name for the subscription filter. If you are updating an existing filter, you must specify the correct name in ``filterName``. To find the name of the filter currently associated with a log group, use `DescribeSubscriptionFilters <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeSubscriptionFilters.html>`__.

    

  
  :type filterPattern: string
  :param filterPattern: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A filter pattern for subscribing to a filtered stream of log events.

    

  
  :type destinationArn: string
  :param destinationArn: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ARN of the destination to deliver matching log events to. Currently, the supported destinations are:

     

    
    * An Amazon Kinesis stream belonging to the same account as the subscription filter, for same-account delivery.
     
    * A logical destination (specified using an ARN) belonging to a different account, for cross-account delivery. If you're setting up a cross-account subscription, the destination must have an IAM policy associated with it. The IAM policy must allow the sender to send logs to the destination. For more information, see `PutDestinationPolicy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutDestinationPolicy.html>`__.
     
    * A Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream belonging to the same account as the subscription filter, for same-account delivery.
     
    * A Lambda function belonging to the same account as the subscription filter, for same-account delivery.
    

    

  
  :type roleArn: string
  :param roleArn: 

    The ARN of an IAM role that grants CloudWatch Logs permissions to deliver ingested log events to the destination stream. You don't need to provide the ARN when you are working with a logical destination for cross-account delivery.

    

  
  :type distribution: string
  :param distribution: 

    The method used to distribute log data to the destination. By default, log data is grouped by log stream, but the grouping can be set to random for a more even distribution. This property is only applicable when the destination is an Amazon Kinesis data stream.

    

  
  :type applyOnTransformedLogs: boolean
  :param applyOnTransformedLogs: 

    This parameter is valid only for log groups that have an active log transformer. For more information about log transformers, see `PutTransformer <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutTransformer.html>`__.

     

    If the log group uses either a log-group level or account-level transformer, and you specify ``true``, the subscription filter will be applied on the transformed version of the log events instead of the original ingested log events.

    

  
  :type fieldSelectionCriteria: string
  :param fieldSelectionCriteria: 

    A filter expression that specifies which log events should be processed by this subscription filter based on system fields such as source account and source region. Uses selection criteria syntax with operators like ``=``, ``!=``, ``AND``, ``OR``, ``IN``, ``NOT IN``. Example: ``@aws.region NOT IN ["cn-north-1"]`` or ``@aws.account = "123456789012" AND @aws.region = "us-east-1"``. Maximum length: 2000 characters.

    

  
  :type emitSystemFields: list
  :param emitSystemFields: 

    A list of system fields to include in the log events sent to the subscription destination. Valid values are ``@aws.account`` and ``@aws.region``. These fields provide source information for centralized log data in the forwarded payload.
