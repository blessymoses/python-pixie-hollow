.. py:method:: CloudWatchLogs.Client.delete_account_policy(**kwargs)

  

  Deletes a CloudWatch Logs account policy. This stops the account-wide policy from applying to log groups or data sources in the account. If you delete a data protection policy or subscription filter policy, any log-group level policies of those types remain in effect. This operation supports deletion of data source-based field index policies, including facet configurations, in addition to log group-based policies.

   

  To use this operation, you must be signed on with the correct permissions depending on the type of policy that you are deleting.

   

  
  * To delete a data protection policy, you must have the ``logs:DeleteDataProtectionPolicy`` and ``logs:DeleteAccountPolicy`` permissions.
   
  * To delete a subscription filter policy, you must have the ``logs:DeleteSubscriptionFilter`` and ``logs:DeleteAccountPolicy`` permissions.
   
  * To delete a transformer policy, you must have the ``logs:DeleteTransformer`` and ``logs:DeleteAccountPolicy`` permissions.
   
  * To delete a field index policy, you must have the ``logs:DeleteIndexPolicy`` and ``logs:DeleteAccountPolicy`` permissions. If you delete a field index policy that included facet configurations, those facets will no longer be available for interactive exploration in the CloudWatch Logs Insights console. However, facet data is retained for up to 30 days.
  

   

  If you delete a field index policy, the indexing of the log events that happened before you deleted the policy will still be used for up to 30 days to improve CloudWatch Logs Insights queries.
