.. py:method:: CloudWatchLogs.Client.list_log_groups(**kwargs)

  

  Returns a list of log groups in the Region in your account. If you are performing this action in a monitoring account, you can choose to also return log groups from source accounts that are linked to the monitoring account. For more information about using cross-account observability to set up monitoring accounts and source accounts, see `CloudWatch cross-account observability <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Unified-Cross-Account.html>`__.

   

  You can optionally filter the list by log group class, by using regular expressions in your request to match strings in the log group names, by using the fieldIndexes parameter to filter log groups based on which field indexes are configured, by using the dataSources parameter to filter log groups by data source types, and by using the fieldIndexNames parameter to filter by specific field index names.

   

  This operation is paginated. By default, your first use of this operation returns 50 results, and includes a token to use in a subsequent operation to return more results.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_log_groups(
        logGroupNamePattern='string',
        logGroupClass='STANDARD'|'INFREQUENT_ACCESS'|'DELIVERY',
        includeLinkedAccounts=True|False,
        accountIdentifiers=[
            'string',
        ],
        nextToken='string',
        limit=123,
        dataSources=[
            {
                'name': 'string',
                'type': 'string'
            },
        ],
        fieldIndexNames=[
            'string',
        ]
    )
    
  :type logGroupNamePattern: string
  :param logGroupNamePattern: 

    Use this parameter to limit the returned log groups to only those with names that match the pattern that you specify. This parameter is a regular expression that can match prefixes and substrings, and supports wildcard matching and matching multiple patterns, as in the following examples.

     

    
    * Use ``^`` to match log group names by prefix.
     
    * For a substring match, specify the string to match. All matches are case sensitive
     
    * To match multiple patterns, separate them with a ``|`` as in the example ``^/aws/lambda|discovery``
    

     

    You can specify as many as five different regular expression patterns in this field, each of which must be between 3 and 24 characters. You can include the ``^`` symbol as many as five times, and include the ``|`` symbol as many as four times.

    

  
  :type logGroupClass: string
  :param logGroupClass: 

    Use this parameter to limit the results to only those log groups in the specified log group class. If you omit this parameter, log groups of all classes can be returned.

    

  
  :type includeLinkedAccounts: boolean
  :param includeLinkedAccounts: 

    If you are using a monitoring account, set this to ``true`` to have the operation return log groups in the accounts listed in ``accountIdentifiers``.

     

    If this parameter is set to ``true`` and ``accountIdentifiers`` contains a null value, the operation returns all log groups in the monitoring account and all log groups in all source accounts that are linked to the monitoring account.

     

    The default for this parameter is ``false``.

    

  
  :type accountIdentifiers: list
  :param accountIdentifiers: 

    When ``includeLinkedAccounts`` is set to ``true``, use this parameter to specify the list of accounts to search. You can specify as many as 20 account IDs in the array.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type nextToken: string
  :param nextToken: 

    The token for the next set of items to return. The token expires after 24 hours.

    

  
  :type limit: integer
  :param limit: 

    The maximum number of log groups to return. If you omit this parameter, the default is up to 50 log groups.

    

  
  :type dataSources: list
  :param dataSources: 

    An array of data source filters to filter log groups by their associated data sources. You can filter by data source name, type, or both. Multiple filters within the same dimension are combined with OR logic, while filters across different dimensions are combined with AND logic.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      Filter criteria for data sources, used to specify which data sources to include in operations based on name and type.

      

    
      - **name** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The name pattern to filter data sources by.

        

      
      - **type** *(string) --* 

        The type pattern to filter data sources by.

        

      
    

  :type fieldIndexNames: list
  :param fieldIndexNames: 

    An array of field index names to filter log groups that have specific field indexes. Only log groups containing all specified field indexes are returned. You can specify 1 to 20 field index names, each with 1 to 512 characters.

    

  
    - *(string) --*
