.. py:method:: ACM.Client.request_certificate(**kwargs)

  

  Requests an ACM certificate for use with other Amazon Web Services services. To request an ACM certificate, you must specify a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) in the ``DomainName`` parameter. You can also specify additional FQDNs in the ``SubjectAlternativeNames`` parameter.

   

  If you are requesting a private certificate, domain validation is not required. If you are requesting a public certificate, each domain name that you specify must be validated to verify that you own or control the domain. You can use `DNS validation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-validate-dns.html>`__ or `email validation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-validate-email.html>`__. We recommend that you use DNS validation.

   

  .. note::

    

    ACM behavior differs from the `RFC 6125 <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6125#appendix-B.2>`__ specification of the certificate validation process. ACM first checks for a Subject Alternative Name, and, if it finds one, ignores the common name (CN).

    

   

  After successful completion of the ``RequestCertificate`` action, there is a delay of several seconds before you can retrieve information about the new certificate.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.request_certificate(
        DomainName='string',
        ValidationMethod='EMAIL'|'DNS'|'HTTP',
        SubjectAlternativeNames=[
            'string',
        ],

                'Key': 'string',
                'Value': 'string'
            },
        ],
        KeyAlgorithm='RSA_1024'|'RSA_2048'|'RSA_3072'|'RSA_4096'|'EC_prime256v1'|'EC_secp384r1'|'EC_secp521r1',
        ManagedBy='CLOUDFRONT'
    )
    
  :type DomainName: string
  :param DomainName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Fully qualified domain name (FQDN), such as www.example.com, that you want to secure with an ACM certificate. Use an asterisk (*) to create a wildcard certificate that protects several sites in the same domain. For example, *.example.com protects www.example.com, site.example.com, and images.example.com.

     

    In compliance with `RFC 5280 <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280>`__, the length of the domain name (technically, the Common Name) that you provide cannot exceed 64 octets (characters), including periods. To add a longer domain name, specify it in the Subject Alternative Name field, which supports names up to 253 octets in length.

    

  
  :type ValidationMethod: string
  :param ValidationMethod: 

    The method you want to use if you are requesting a public certificate to validate that you own or control domain. You can `validate with DNS <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-validate-dns.html>`__ or `validate with email <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-validate-email.html>`__. We recommend that you use DNS validation.

    

  
  :type SubjectAlternativeNames: list
  :param SubjectAlternativeNames: 

    Additional FQDNs to be included in the Subject Alternative Name extension of the ACM certificate. For example, add the name www.example.net to a certificate for which the ``DomainName`` field is www.example.com if users can reach your site by using either name. The maximum number of domain names that you can add to an ACM certificate is 100. However, the initial quota is 10 domain names. If you need more than 10 names, you must request a quota increase. For more information, see `Quotas <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-limits.html>`__.

     

    The maximum length of a SAN DNS name is 253 octets. The name is made up of multiple labels separated by periods. No label can be longer than 63 octets. Consider the following examples:

     

    
    * ``(63 octets).(63 octets).(63 octets).(61 octets)`` is legal because the total length is 253 octets (63+1+63+1+63+1+61) and no label exceeds 63 octets.
     
    * ``(64 octets).(63 octets).(63 octets).(61 octets)`` is not legal because the total length exceeds 253 octets (64+1+63+1+63+1+61) and the first label exceeds 63 octets.
     
    * ``(63 octets).(63 octets).(63 octets).(62 octets)`` is not legal because the total length of the DNS name (63+1+63+1+63+1+62) exceeds 253 octets.
    

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type IdempotencyToken: string
  :param IdempotencyToken: 

    Customer chosen string that can be used to distinguish between calls to ``RequestCertificate``. Idempotency tokens time out after one hour. Therefore, if you call ``RequestCertificate`` multiple times with the same idempotency token within one hour, ACM recognizes that you are requesting only one certificate and will issue only one. If you change the idempotency token for each call, ACM recognizes that you are requesting multiple certificates.

    

  
  :type DomainValidationOptions: list
  :param DomainValidationOptions: 

    The domain name that you want ACM to use to send you emails so that you can validate domain ownership.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      Contains information about the domain names that you want ACM to use to send you emails that enable you to validate domain ownership.

      

    
      - **DomainName** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        A fully qualified domain name (FQDN) in the certificate request.

        

      
      - **ValidationDomain** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The domain name that you want ACM to use to send you validation emails. This domain name is the suffix of the email addresses that you want ACM to use. This must be the same as the ``DomainName`` value or a superdomain of the ``DomainName`` value. For example, if you request a certificate for ``testing.example.com``, you can specify ``example.com`` for this value. In that case, ACM sends domain validation emails to the following five addresses:

         

        
        * admin@example.com
         
        * administrator@example.com
         
        * hostmaster@example.com
         
        * postmaster@example.com
         
        * webmaster@example.com
        

        

      
    

  :type Options: dict
  :param Options: 

    You can use this parameter to specify whether to add the certificate to a certificate transparency log and export your certificate.

     

    Certificate transparency makes it possible to detect SSL/TLS certificates that have been mistakenly or maliciously issued. Certificates that have not been logged typically produce an error message in a browser. For more information, see `Opting Out of Certificate Transparency Logging <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-bestpractices.html#best-practices-transparency>`__.

     

    You can export public ACM certificates to use with Amazon Web Services services as well as outside the Amazon Web Services Cloud. For more information, see `Certificate Manager exportable public certificate <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-exportable-certificates.html>`__.

    

  
    - **CertificateTransparencyLoggingPreference** *(string) --* 

      You can opt out of certificate transparency logging by specifying the ``DISABLED`` option. Opt in by specifying ``ENABLED``.

      

    
    - **Export** *(string) --* 

      You can opt in to allow the export of your certificates by specifying ``ENABLED``.

      

    
  
  :type CertificateAuthorityArn: string
  :param CertificateAuthorityArn: 

    The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the private certificate authority (CA) that will be used to issue the certificate. If you do not provide an ARN and you are trying to request a private certificate, ACM will attempt to issue a public certificate. For more information about private CAs, see the `Amazon Web Services Private Certificate Authority <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/PcaWelcome.html>`__ user guide. The ARN must have the following form:

     

    ``arn:aws:acm-pca:region:account:certificate-authority/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012``

    

  
  :type Tags: list
  :param Tags: 

    One or more resource tags to associate with the certificate.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      A key-value pair that identifies or specifies metadata about an ACM resource.

      

    
      - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The key of the tag.

        

      
      - **Value** *(string) --* 

        The value of the tag.

        

      
    

  :type KeyAlgorithm: string
  :param KeyAlgorithm: 

    Specifies the algorithm of the public and private key pair that your certificate uses to encrypt data. RSA is the default key algorithm for ACM certificates. Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) keys are smaller, offering security comparable to RSA keys but with greater computing efficiency. However, ECDSA is not supported by all network clients. Some Amazon Web Services services may require RSA keys, or only support ECDSA keys of a particular size, while others allow the use of either RSA and ECDSA keys to ensure that compatibility is not broken. Check the requirements for the Amazon Web Services service where you plan to deploy your certificate. For more information about selecting an algorithm, see `Key algorithms <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-certificate.html#algorithms>`__.

     

    .. note::

      

      Algorithms supported for an ACM certificate request include:

       

      
      * ``RSA_2048``
       
      * ``EC_prime256v1``
       
      * ``EC_secp384r1``
      

       

      Other listed algorithms are for imported certificates only.

      

     

    .. note::

      

      When you request a private PKI certificate signed by a CA from Amazon Web Services Private CA, the specified signing algorithm family (RSA or ECDSA) must match the algorithm family of the CA's secret key.

      

     

    Default: RSA_2048

    

  
  :type ManagedBy: string
  :param ManagedBy: 

    Identifies the Amazon Web Services service that manages the certificate issued by ACM.
