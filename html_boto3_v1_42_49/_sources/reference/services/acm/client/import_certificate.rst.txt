.. py:method:: ACM.Client.import_certificate(**kwargs)

  

  Imports a certificate into Certificate Manager (ACM) to use with services that are integrated with ACM. Note that `integrated services <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-services.html>`__ allow only certificate types and keys they support to be associated with their resources. Further, their support differs depending on whether the certificate is imported into IAM or into ACM. For more information, see the documentation for each service. For more information about importing certificates into ACM, see `Importing Certificates <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/import-certificate.html>`__ in the *Certificate Manager User Guide*.

   

  .. note::

    

    ACM does not provide `managed renewal <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-renewal.html>`__ for certificates that you import.

    

   

  Note the following guidelines when importing third party certificates:

   

  
  * You must enter the private key that matches the certificate you are importing.
   
  * The private key must be unencrypted. You cannot import a private key that is protected by a password or a passphrase.
   
  * The private key must be no larger than 5 KB (5,120 bytes).
   
  * The certificate, private key, and certificate chain must be PEM-encoded.
   
  * The current time must be between the ``Not Before`` and ``Not After`` certificate fields.
   
  * The ``Issuer`` field must not be empty.
   
  * The OCSP authority URL, if present, must not exceed 1000 characters.
   
  * To import a new certificate, omit the ``CertificateArn`` argument. Include this argument only when you want to replace a previously imported certificate.
   
  * When you import a certificate by using the CLI, you must specify the certificate, the certificate chain, and the private key by their file names preceded by ``fileb://``. For example, you can specify a certificate saved in the ``C:\temp`` folder as ``fileb://C:\temp\certificate_to_import.pem``. If you are making an HTTP or HTTPS Query request, include these arguments as BLOBs.
   
  * When you import a certificate by using an SDK, you must specify the certificate, the certificate chain, and the private key files in the manner required by the programming language you're using.
   
  * The cryptographic algorithm of an imported certificate must match the algorithm of the signing CA. For example, if the signing CA key type is RSA, then the certificate key type must also be RSA.
  

   

  This operation returns the `Amazon Resource Name (ARN) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html>`__ of the imported certificate.
