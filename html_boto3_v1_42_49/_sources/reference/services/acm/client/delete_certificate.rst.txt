.. py:method:: ACM.Client.delete_certificate(**kwargs)

  

  Deletes a certificate and its associated private key. If this action succeeds, the certificate no longer appears in the list that can be displayed by calling the  ListCertificates action or be retrieved by calling the  GetCertificate action. The certificate will not be available for use by Amazon Web Services services integrated with ACM.

   

  .. note::

    

    You cannot delete an ACM certificate that is being used by another Amazon Web Services service. To delete a certificate that is in use, the certificate association must first be removed.
