.. py:method:: Omics.Client.delete_sequence_store(**kwargs)

  

  Deletes a sequence store and returns a response with no body if the operation is successful. You can only delete a sequence store when it does not contain any read sets.

   

  Use the ``BatchDeleteReadSet`` API operation to ensure that all read sets in the sequence store are deleted. When a sequence store is deleted, all tags associated with the store are also deleted.

   

  For more information, see `Deleting HealthOmics reference and sequence stores <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/omics/latest/dev/deleting-reference-and-sequence-stores.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services HealthOmics User Guide*.
