.. py:method:: Omics.Client.delete_run(**kwargs)

  

  Deletes a run and returns a response with no body if the operation is successful. You can only delete a run that has reached a ``COMPLETED``, ``FAILED``, or ``CANCELLED`` stage. A completed run has delivered an output, or was cancelled and resulted in no output. When you delete a run, only the metadata associated with the run is deleted. The run outputs remain in Amazon S3 and logs remain in CloudWatch.

   

  To verify that the workflow is deleted:

   

  
  * Use ``ListRuns`` to confirm the workflow no longer appears in the list.
   
  * Use ``GetRun`` to verify the workflow cannot be found.
