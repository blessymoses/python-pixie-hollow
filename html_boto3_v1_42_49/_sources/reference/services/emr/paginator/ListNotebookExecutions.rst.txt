      )
      
    :type EditorId: string
    :param EditorId: 

      The unique ID of the editor associated with the notebook execution.

      

    
    :type Status: string
    :param Status: 

      The status filter for listing notebook executions.

       

      
      * ``START_PENDING`` indicates that the cluster has received the execution request but execution has not begun.
       
      * ``STARTING`` indicates that the execution is starting on the cluster.
       
      * ``RUNNING`` indicates that the execution is being processed by the cluster.
       
      * ``FINISHING`` indicates that execution processing is in the final stages.
       
      * ``FINISHED`` indicates that the execution has completed without error.
       
      * ``FAILING`` indicates that the execution is failing and will not finish successfully.
       
      * ``FAILED`` indicates that the execution failed.
       
      * ``STOP_PENDING`` indicates that the cluster has received a ``StopNotebookExecution`` request and the stop is pending.
       
      * ``STOPPING`` indicates that the cluster is in the process of stopping the execution as a result of a ``StopNotebookExecution`` request.
       
      * ``STOPPED`` indicates that the execution stopped because of a ``StopNotebookExecution`` request.
      

      

    
    :type From: datetime
    :param From: 

      The beginning of time range filter for listing notebook executions. The default is the timestamp of 30 days ago.

      

    
    :type To: datetime
    :param To: 

      The end of time range filter for listing notebook executions. The default is the current timestamp.

      

    
    :type ExecutionEngineId: string
    :param ExecutionEngineId: 

      The unique ID of the execution engine.

      

    
    :type PaginationConfig: dict
    :param PaginationConfig: 

      A dictionary that provides parameters to control pagination.

      

    
      - **MaxItems** *(integer) --* 

        The total number of items to return. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified in max-items then a ``NextToken`` will be provided in the output that you can use to resume pagination.

        

      
      - **StartingToken** *(string) --* 

        A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previous response.
