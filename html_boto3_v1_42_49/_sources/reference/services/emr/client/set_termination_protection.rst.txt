.. py:method:: EMR.Client.set_termination_protection(**kwargs)

  

  SetTerminationProtection locks a cluster (job flow) so the Amazon EC2 instances in the cluster cannot be terminated by user intervention, an API call, or in the event of a job-flow error. The cluster still terminates upon successful completion of the job flow. Calling ``SetTerminationProtection`` on a cluster is similar to calling the Amazon EC2 ``DisableAPITermination`` API on all Amazon EC2 instances in a cluster.

   

  ``SetTerminationProtection`` is used to prevent accidental termination of a cluster and to ensure that in the event of an error, the instances persist so that you can recover any data stored in their ephemeral instance storage.

   

  To terminate a cluster that has been locked by setting ``SetTerminationProtection`` to ``true``, you must first unlock the job flow by a subsequent call to ``SetTerminationProtection`` in which you set the value to ``false``.

   

  For more information, see `Managing Cluster Termination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/UsingEMR_TerminationProtection.html>`__ in the *Amazon EMR Management Guide*.

  :type JobFlowIds: list
  :param JobFlowIds: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A list of strings that uniquely identify the clusters to protect. This identifier is returned by  RunJobFlow and can also be obtained from  DescribeJobFlows .

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type TerminationProtected: boolean
  :param TerminationProtected: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A Boolean that indicates whether to protect the cluster and prevent the Amazon EC2 instances in the cluster from shutting down due to API calls, user intervention, or job-flow error.
