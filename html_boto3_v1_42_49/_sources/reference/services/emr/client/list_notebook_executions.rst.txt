.. py:method:: EMR.Client.list_notebook_executions(**kwargs)

  

  Provides summaries of all notebook executions. You can filter the list based on multiple criteria such as status, time range, and editor id. Returns a maximum of 50 notebook executions and a marker to track the paging of a longer notebook execution list across multiple ``ListNotebookExecutions`` calls.

        From=datetime(2015, 1, 1),
        To=datetime(2015, 1, 1),
        Marker='string',
        ExecutionEngineId='string'
    )
    
  :type EditorId: string
  :param EditorId: 

    The unique ID of the editor associated with the notebook execution.

    

  
  :type Status: string
  :param Status: 

    The status filter for listing notebook executions.

     

    
    * ``START_PENDING`` indicates that the cluster has received the execution request but execution has not begun.
     
    * ``STARTING`` indicates that the execution is starting on the cluster.
     
    * ``RUNNING`` indicates that the execution is being processed by the cluster.
     
    * ``FINISHING`` indicates that execution processing is in the final stages.
     
    * ``FINISHED`` indicates that the execution has completed without error.
     
    * ``FAILING`` indicates that the execution is failing and will not finish successfully.
     
    * ``FAILED`` indicates that the execution failed.
     
    * ``STOP_PENDING`` indicates that the cluster has received a ``StopNotebookExecution`` request and the stop is pending.
     
    * ``STOPPING`` indicates that the cluster is in the process of stopping the execution as a result of a ``StopNotebookExecution`` request.
     
    * ``STOPPED`` indicates that the execution stopped because of a ``StopNotebookExecution`` request.
    

    

  
  :type From: datetime
  :param From: 

    The beginning of time range filter for listing notebook executions. The default is the timestamp of 30 days ago.

    

  
  :type To: datetime
  :param To: 

    The end of time range filter for listing notebook executions. The default is the current timestamp.

    

  
  :type Marker: string
  :param Marker: 

    The pagination token, returned by a previous ``ListNotebookExecutions`` call, that indicates the start of the list for this ``ListNotebookExecutions`` call.

    

  
  :type ExecutionEngineId: string
  :param ExecutionEngineId: 

    The unique ID of the execution engine.
