  :type ClusterId: string
  :param ClusterId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The unique identifier of the cluster.

    

  
  :type InstanceFleet: dict
  :param InstanceFleet: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies the configuration of the instance fleet.

    

  
    - **Name** *(string) --* 

      The friendly name of the instance fleet.

    - **TargetOnDemandCapacity** *(integer) --* 

      The target capacity of On-Demand units for the instance fleet, which determines how many On-Demand Instances to provision. When the instance fleet launches, Amazon EMR tries to provision On-Demand Instances as specified by  InstanceTypeConfig. Each instance configuration has a specified ``WeightedCapacity``. When an On-Demand Instance is provisioned, the ``WeightedCapacity`` units count toward the target capacity. Amazon EMR provisions instances until the target capacity is totally fulfilled, even if this results in an overage. For example, if there are 2 units remaining to fulfill capacity, and Amazon EMR can only provision an instance with a ``WeightedCapacity`` of 5 units, the instance is provisioned, and the target capacity is exceeded by 3 units.

       

      .. note::

        

        If not specified or set to 0, only Spot Instances are provisioned for the instance fleet using ``TargetSpotCapacity``. At least one of ``TargetSpotCapacity`` and ``TargetOnDemandCapacity`` should be greater than 0. For a master instance fleet, only one of ``TargetSpotCapacity`` and ``TargetOnDemandCapacity`` can be specified, and its value must be 1.

        

      

    
    - **TargetSpotCapacity** *(integer) --* 

      The target capacity of Spot units for the instance fleet, which determines how many Spot Instances to provision. When the instance fleet launches, Amazon EMR tries to provision Spot Instances as specified by  InstanceTypeConfig. Each instance configuration has a specified ``WeightedCapacity``. When a Spot Instance is provisioned, the ``WeightedCapacity`` units count toward the target capacity. Amazon EMR provisions instances until the target capacity is totally fulfilled, even if this results in an overage. For example, if there are 2 units remaining to fulfill capacity, and Amazon EMR can only provision an instance with a ``WeightedCapacity`` of 5 units, the instance is provisioned, and the target capacity is exceeded by 3 units.

       

      .. note::

        

        If not specified or set to 0, only On-Demand Instances are provisioned for the instance fleet. At least one of ``TargetSpotCapacity`` and ``TargetOnDemandCapacity`` should be greater than 0. For a master instance fleet, only one of ``TargetSpotCapacity`` and ``TargetOnDemandCapacity`` can be specified, and its value must be 1.

        

      

    
    - **InstanceTypeConfigs** *(list) --* 

      The instance type configurations that define the Amazon EC2 instances in the instance fleet.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        An instance type configuration for each instance type in an instance fleet, which determines the Amazon EC2 instances Amazon EMR attempts to provision to fulfill On-Demand and Spot target capacities. When you use an allocation strategy, you can include a maximum of 30 instance type configurations for a fleet. For more information about how to use an allocation strategy, see `Configure Instance Fleets <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-instance-fleet.html>`__. Without an allocation strategy, you may specify a maximum of five instance type configurations for a fleet.

        - **WeightedCapacity** *(integer) --* 

          The number of units that a provisioned instance of this type provides toward fulfilling the target capacities defined in  InstanceFleetConfig. This value is 1 for a master instance fleet, and must be 1 or greater for core and task instance fleets. Defaults to 1 if not specified.

          

        
        - **BidPrice** *(string) --* 

          The bid price for each Amazon EC2 Spot Instance type as defined by ``InstanceType``. Expressed in USD. If neither ``BidPrice`` nor ``BidPriceAsPercentageOfOnDemandPrice`` is provided, ``BidPriceAsPercentageOfOnDemandPrice`` defaults to 100%.

            An optional configuration specification to be used when provisioning cluster instances, which can include configurations for applications and software bundled with Amazon EMR. A configuration consists of a classification, properties, and optional nested configurations. A classification refers to an application-specific configuration file. Properties are the settings you want to change in that file. For more information, see `Configuring Applications <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ReleaseGuide/emr-configure-apps.html>`__.

            

          
            - **Classification** *(string) --* 

              The classification within a configuration.

              

            
            - **Configurations** *(list) --*

        - **Priority** *(float) --* 

          The priority at which Amazon EMR launches the Amazon EC2 instances with this instance type. Priority starts at 0, which is the highest priority. Amazon EMR considers the highest priority first.

          

        
      
  
    - **LaunchSpecifications** *(dict) --* 

      The launch specification for the instance fleet.

      

    
      - **SpotSpecification** *(dict) --* 

        The launch specification for Spot instances in the fleet, which determines the allocation strategy, defined duration, and provisioning timeout behavior.

        

      
        - **TimeoutDurationMinutes** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The Spot provisioning timeout period in minutes. If Spot Instances are not provisioned within this time period, the ``TimeOutAction`` is taken. Minimum value is 5 and maximum value is 1440. The timeout applies only during initial provisioning, when the cluster is first created.

          

        
        - **TimeoutAction** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The action to take when ``TargetSpotCapacity`` has not been fulfilled when the ``TimeoutDurationMinutes`` has expired; that is, when all Spot Instances could not be provisioned within the Spot provisioning timeout. Valid values are ``TERMINATE_CLUSTER`` and ``SWITCH_TO_ON_DEMAND``. SWITCH_TO_ON_DEMAND specifies that if no Spot Instances are available, On-Demand Instances should be provisioned to fulfill any remaining Spot capacity.

          

        
        - **BlockDurationMinutes** *(integer) --* 

          The defined duration for Spot Instances (also known as Spot blocks) in minutes. When specified, the Spot Instance does not terminate before the defined duration expires, and defined duration pricing for Spot Instances applies. Valid values are 60, 120, 180, 240, 300, or 360. The duration period starts as soon as a Spot Instance receives its instance ID. At the end of the duration, Amazon EC2 marks the Spot Instance for termination and provides a Spot Instance termination notice, which gives the instance a two-minute warning before it terminates.

           

          .. note::

            

            Spot Instances with a defined duration (also known as Spot blocks) are no longer available to new customers from July 1, 2021. For customers who have previously used the feature, we will continue to support Spot Instances with a defined duration until December 31, 2022.

            

          

        
        - **AllocationStrategy** *(string) --* 

          Specifies one of the following strategies to launch Spot Instance fleets: ``capacity-optimized``, ``price-capacity-optimized``, ``lowest-price``, or ``diversified``, and ``capacity-optimized-prioritized``. For more information on the provisioning strategies, see `Allocation strategies for Spot Instances <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-fleet-allocation-strategy.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*.

           

          .. note::

            

            When you launch a Spot Instance fleet with the old console, it automatically launches with the ``capacity-optimized`` strategy. You can't change the allocation strategy from the old console.

            

          

        
      
      - **OnDemandSpecification** *(dict) --* 

        The launch specification for On-Demand Instances in the instance fleet, which determines the allocation strategy and capacity reservation options.

         

        .. note::

          

          The instance fleet configuration is available only in Amazon EMR releases 4.8.0 and later, excluding 5.0.x versions. On-Demand Instances allocation strategy is available in Amazon EMR releases 5.12.1 and later.

          

        

      
        - **AllocationStrategy** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          Specifies the strategy to use in launching On-Demand instance fleets. Available options are ``lowest-price`` and ``prioritized``. ``lowest-price`` specifies to launch the instances with the lowest price first, and ``prioritized`` specifies that Amazon EMR should launch the instances with the highest priority first. The default is ``lowest-price``.

          

        
        - **CapacityReservationOptions** *(dict) --* 

          The launch specification for On-Demand instances in the instance fleet, which determines the allocation strategy.

          

        
          - **UsageStrategy** *(string) --* 

            Indicates whether to use unused Capacity Reservations for fulfilling On-Demand capacity.

             

            If you specify ``use-capacity-reservations-first``, the fleet uses unused Capacity Reservations to fulfill On-Demand capacity up to the target On-Demand capacity. If multiple instance pools have unused Capacity Reservations, the On-Demand allocation strategy ( ``lowest-price``) is applied. If the number of unused Capacity Reservations is less than the On-Demand target capacity, the remaining On-Demand target capacity is launched according to the On-Demand allocation strategy ( ``lowest-price``).

             

            If you do not specify a value, the fleet fulfills the On-Demand capacity according to the chosen On-Demand allocation strategy.

            

          
          - **CapacityReservationPreference** *(string) --* 

            Indicates the instance's Capacity Reservation preferences. Possible preferences include:

             

            
            * ``open`` - The instance can run in any open Capacity Reservation that has matching attributes (instance type, platform, Availability Zone).
             
            * ``none`` - The instance avoids running in a Capacity Reservation even if one is available. The instance runs as an On-Demand Instance.
            

            

          
          - **CapacityReservationResourceGroupArn** *(string) --* 

            The ARN of the Capacity Reservation resource group in which to run the instance.

            

          
        
      
    
    - **ResizeSpecifications** *(dict) --* 

      The resize specification for the instance fleet.

      

    
      - **SpotResizeSpecification** *(dict) --* 

        The resize specification for Spot Instances in the instance fleet, which contains the allocation strategy and the resize timeout period.

        

      
        - **TimeoutDurationMinutes** *(integer) --* 

          Spot resize timeout in minutes. If Spot Instances are not provisioned within this time, the resize workflow will stop provisioning of Spot instances. Minimum value is 5 minutes and maximum value is 10,080 minutes (7 days). The timeout applies to all resize workflows on the Instance Fleet. The resize could be triggered by Amazon EMR Managed Scaling or by the customer (via Amazon EMR Console, Amazon EMR CLI modify-instance-fleet or Amazon EMR SDK ModifyInstanceFleet API) or by Amazon EMR due to Amazon EC2 Spot Reclamation.

          

        
        - **AllocationStrategy** *(string) --* 

          Specifies the allocation strategy to use to launch Spot instances during a resize. If you run Amazon EMR releases 6.9.0 or higher, the default is ``price-capacity-optimized``. If you run Amazon EMR releases 6.8.0 or lower, the default is ``capacity-optimized``.

          

        
      
      - **OnDemandResizeSpecification** *(dict) --* 

        The resize specification for On-Demand Instances in the instance fleet, which contains the allocation strategy, capacity reservation options, and the resize timeout period.

        

      
        - **TimeoutDurationMinutes** *(integer) --* 

          On-Demand resize timeout in minutes. If On-Demand Instances are not provisioned within this time, the resize workflow stops. The minimum value is 5 minutes, and the maximum value is 10,080 minutes (7 days). The timeout applies to all resize workflows on the Instance Fleet. The resize could be triggered by Amazon EMR Managed Scaling or by the customer (via Amazon EMR Console, Amazon EMR CLI modify-instance-fleet or Amazon EMR SDK ModifyInstanceFleet API) or by Amazon EMR due to Amazon EC2 Spot Reclamation.

          

        
        - **AllocationStrategy** *(string) --* 

          Specifies the allocation strategy to use to launch On-Demand instances during a resize. The default is ``lowest-price``.

          

        
        - **CapacityReservationOptions** *(dict) --* 

          Describes the strategy for using unused Capacity Reservations for fulfilling On-Demand capacity.

          

        
          - **UsageStrategy** *(string) --* 

            Indicates whether to use unused Capacity Reservations for fulfilling On-Demand capacity.

             

            If you specify ``use-capacity-reservations-first``, the fleet uses unused Capacity Reservations to fulfill On-Demand capacity up to the target On-Demand capacity. If multiple instance pools have unused Capacity Reservations, the On-Demand allocation strategy ( ``lowest-price``) is applied. If the number of unused Capacity Reservations is less than the On-Demand target capacity, the remaining On-Demand target capacity is launched according to the On-Demand allocation strategy ( ``lowest-price``).

             

            If you do not specify a value, the fleet fulfills the On-Demand capacity according to the chosen On-Demand allocation strategy.

            

          
          - **CapacityReservationPreference** *(string) --* 

            Indicates the instance's Capacity Reservation preferences. Possible preferences include:

             

            
            * ``open`` - The instance can run in any open Capacity Reservation that has matching attributes (instance type, platform, Availability Zone).
             
            * ``none`` - The instance avoids running in a Capacity Reservation even if one is available. The instance runs as an On-Demand Instance.
            

            

          
          - **CapacityReservationResourceGroupArn** *(string) --* 

            The ARN of the Capacity Reservation resource group in which to run the instance.

            

          
        
      
    
    - **Context** *(string) --* 

      Reserved.
