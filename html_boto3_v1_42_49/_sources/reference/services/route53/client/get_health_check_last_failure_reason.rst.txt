  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.get_health_check_last_failure_reason(
        HealthCheckId='string'
    )
    
  :type HealthCheckId: string
  :param HealthCheckId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ID for the health check for which you want the last failure reason. When you created the health check, ``CreateHealthCheck`` returned the ID in the response, in the ``HealthCheckId`` element.

     

    .. note::

      

      If you want to get the last failure reason for a calculated health check, you must use the Amazon Route 53 console or the CloudWatch console. You can't use ``GetHealthCheckLastFailureReason`` for a calculated health check.
