  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_traffic_policies(
        TrafficPolicyIdMarker='string',
        MaxItems='string'
    )
    
  :type TrafficPolicyIdMarker: string
  :param TrafficPolicyIdMarker: 

    (Conditional) For your first request to ``ListTrafficPolicies``, don't include the ``TrafficPolicyIdMarker`` parameter.

     

    If you have more traffic policies than the value of ``MaxItems``, ``ListTrafficPolicies`` returns only the first ``MaxItems`` traffic policies. To get the next group of policies, submit another request to ``ListTrafficPolicies``. For the value of ``TrafficPolicyIdMarker``, specify the value of ``TrafficPolicyIdMarker`` that was returned in the previous response.

    

  
  :type MaxItems: string
  :param MaxItems: 

    (Optional) The maximum number of traffic policies that you want Amazon Route 53 to return in response to this request. If you have more than ``MaxItems`` traffic policies, the value of ``IsTruncated`` in the response is ``true``, and the value of ``TrafficPolicyIdMarker`` is the ID of the first traffic policy that Route 53 will return if you submit another request.
