    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **Status** *(dict) --* 

        A string representing the status of DNSSEC.

        
        

        - **ServeSignature** *(string) --* 

          A string that represents the current hosted zone signing status.

           

          Status can have one of the following values:

            SIGNING  

          DNSSEC signing is enabled for the hosted zone.

            NOT_SIGNING  

          DNSSEC signing is not enabled for the hosted zone.

            DELETING  

          DNSSEC signing is in the process of being removed for the hosted zone.

            ACTION_NEEDED  

          There is a problem with signing in the hosted zone that requires you to take action to resolve. For example, the customer managed key might have been deleted, or the permissions for the customer managed key might have been changed.

            INTERNAL_FAILURE  

          There was an error during a request. Before you can continue to work with DNSSEC signing, including with key-signing keys (KSKs), you must correct the problem by enabling or disabling DNSSEC signing for the hosted zone.

          
        

        - **StatusMessage** *(string) --* 

          The status message provided for the following DNSSEC signing status: ``INTERNAL_FAILURE``. The status message includes information about what the problem might be and steps that you can take to correct the issue.

          
    
      

      - **KeySigningKeys** *(list) --* 

        The key-signing keys (KSKs) in your account.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          A key-signing key (KSK) is a complex type that represents a public/private key pair. The private key is used to generate a digital signature for the zone signing key (ZSK). The public key is stored in the DNS and is used to authenticate the ZSK. A KSK is always associated with a hosted zone; it cannot exist by itself.

          
          

          - **Name** *(string) --* 

            A string used to identify a key-signing key (KSK). ``Name`` can include numbers, letters, and underscores (_). ``Name`` must be unique for each key-signing key in the same hosted zone.

            
          

          - **KmsArn** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon resource name (ARN) used to identify the customer managed key in Key Management Service (KMS). The ``KmsArn`` must be unique for each key-signing key (KSK) in a single hosted zone.

             

            You must configure the customer managed key as follows:

              Status  

            Enabled

              Key spec  

            ECC_NIST_P256

              Key usage  

            Sign and verify

              Key policy  

            The key policy must give permission for the following actions:

             

            
            * DescribeKey
             
            * GetPublicKey
             
            * Sign
            

             

            The key policy must also include the Amazon Route 53 service in the principal for your account. Specify the following:

             

            
            * ``"Service": "dnssec-route53.amazonaws.com"``
            

               

            For more information about working with the customer managed key in KMS, see `Key Management Service concepts <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html>`__.

          - **SigningAlgorithmMnemonic** *(string) --* 

            A string used to represent the signing algorithm. This value must follow the guidelines provided by `RFC-8624 Section 3.1 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8624#section-3.1>`__.

          - **DigestValue** *(string) --* 

            A cryptographic digest of a DNSKEY resource record (RR). DNSKEY records are used to publish the public key that resolvers can use to verify DNSSEC signatures that are used to secure certain kinds of information provided by the DNS system.

              ACTIVE  

            The KSK is being used for signing.

            The KSK is not being used for signing.

              DELETING  

            The KSK is in the process of being deleted.

              ACTION_NEEDED  

            There is a problem with the KSK that requires you to take action to resolve. For example, the customer managed key might have been deleted, or the permissions for the customer managed key might have been changed.

              INTERNAL_FAILURE  

            There was an error during a request. Before you can continue to work with DNSSEC signing, including actions that involve this KSK, you must correct the problem. For example, you may need to activate or deactivate the KSK.
