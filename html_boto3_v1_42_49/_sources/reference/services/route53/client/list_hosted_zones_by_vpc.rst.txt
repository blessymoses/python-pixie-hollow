.. py:method:: Route53.Client.list_hosted_zones_by_vpc(**kwargs)

  

  Lists all the private hosted zones that a specified VPC is associated with, regardless of which Amazon Web Services account or Amazon Web Services service owns the hosted zones. The ``HostedZoneOwner`` structure in the response contains one of the following values:

   

  
  * An ``OwningAccount`` element, which contains the account number of either the current Amazon Web Services account or another Amazon Web Services account. Some services, such as Cloud Map, create hosted zones using the current account.
   
  * An ``OwningService`` element, which identifies the Amazon Web Services service that created and owns the hosted zone. For example, if a hosted zone was created by Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS), the value of ``Owner`` is ``efs.amazonaws.com``.
  

   

  ``ListHostedZonesByVPC`` returns the hosted zones associated with the specified VPC and does not reflect the hosted zone associations to VPCs via Route 53 Profiles. To get the associations to a Profile, call the `ListProfileResourceAssociations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53profiles_ListProfileResourceAssociations.html>`__ API.

   

  .. note::

    

    When listing private hosted zones, the hosted zone and the Amazon VPC must belong to the same partition where the hosted zones were created. A partition is a group of Amazon Web Services Regions. Each Amazon Web Services account is scoped to one partition.

     

    The following are the supported partitions:

     

    
    * ``aws`` - Amazon Web Services Regions
     
    * ``aws-cn`` - China Regions
     
    * ``aws-us-gov`` - Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region
    

     

    For more information, see `Access Management <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*.

        MaxItems='string',
        NextToken='string'
    )
    
  :type VPCId: string
  :param VPCId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ID of the Amazon VPC that you want to list hosted zones for.

    

  
  :type VPCRegion: string
  :param VPCRegion: **[REQUIRED]** 

    For the Amazon VPC that you specified for ``VPCId``, the Amazon Web Services Region that you created the VPC in.

    

  
  :type MaxItems: string
  :param MaxItems: 

    (Optional) The maximum number of hosted zones that you want Amazon Route 53 to return. If the specified VPC is associated with more than ``MaxItems`` hosted zones, the response includes a ``NextToken`` element. ``NextToken`` contains an encrypted token that identifies the first hosted zone that Route 53 will return if you submit another request.

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    If the previous response included a ``NextToken`` element, the specified VPC is associated with more hosted zones. To get more hosted zones, submit another ``ListHostedZonesByVPC`` request.

     

    For the value of ``NextToken``, specify the value of ``NextToken`` from the previous response.

     

    If the previous response didn't include a ``NextToken`` element, there are no more hosted zones to get.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **HostedZoneSummaries** *(list) --* 

        A list that contains one ``HostedZoneSummary`` element for each hosted zone that the specified Amazon VPC is associated with. Each ``HostedZoneSummary`` element contains the hosted zone name and ID, and information about who owns the hosted zone.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          In the response to a ``ListHostedZonesByVPC`` request, the ``HostedZoneSummaries`` element contains one ``HostedZoneSummary`` element for each hosted zone that the specified Amazon VPC is associated with. Each ``HostedZoneSummary`` element contains the hosted zone name and ID, and information about who owns the hosted zone.

          
          

          - **HostedZoneId** *(string) --* 

            The Route 53 hosted zone ID of a private hosted zone that the specified VPC is associated with.

            
          

          - **Name** *(string) --* 

            The name of the private hosted zone, such as ``example.com``.

            
          

          - **Owner** *(dict) --* 

            The owner of a private hosted zone that the specified VPC is associated with. The owner can be either an Amazon Web Services account or an Amazon Web Services service.

            
            

            - **OwningAccount** *(string) --* 

              If the hosted zone was created by an Amazon Web Services account, or was created by an Amazon Web Services service that creates hosted zones using the current account, ``OwningAccount`` contains the account ID of that account. For example, when you use Cloud Map to create a hosted zone, Cloud Map creates the hosted zone using the current Amazon Web Services account.

              
            

            - **OwningService** *(string) --* 

              If an Amazon Web Services service uses its own account to create a hosted zone and associate the specified VPC with that hosted zone, ``OwningService`` contains an abbreviation that identifies the service. For example, if Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) created a hosted zone and associated a VPC with the hosted zone, the value of ``OwningService`` is ``efs.amazonaws.com``.

              
        
      
    
      

      - **MaxItems** *(string) --* 

        The value that you specified for ``MaxItems`` in the most recent ``ListHostedZonesByVPC`` request.

        
      

      - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

        The value that you will use for ``NextToken`` in the next ``ListHostedZonesByVPC`` request.
