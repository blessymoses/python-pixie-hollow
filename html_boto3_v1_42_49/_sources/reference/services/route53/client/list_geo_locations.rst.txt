.. py:method:: Route53.Client.list_geo_locations(**kwargs)

  

  Retrieves a list of supported geographic locations.

   

  Countries are listed first, and continents are listed last. If Amazon Route 53 supports subdivisions for a country (for example, states or provinces), the subdivisions for that country are listed in alphabetical order immediately after the corresponding country.

   

  Route 53 does not perform authorization for this API because it retrieves information that is already available to the public.

   

  For a list of supported geolocation codes, see the `GeoLocation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_GeoLocation.html>`__ data type.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_geo_locations(
        StartContinentCode='string',
        StartCountryCode='string',
        StartSubdivisionCode='string',
        MaxItems='string'
    )
    
  :type StartContinentCode: string
  :param StartContinentCode: 

    The code for the continent with which you want to start listing locations that Amazon Route 53 supports for geolocation. If Route 53 has already returned a page or more of results, if ``IsTruncated`` is true, and if ``NextContinentCode`` from the previous response has a value, enter that value in ``startcontinentcode`` to return the next page of results.

     

    Include ``startcontinentcode`` only if you want to list continents. Don't include ``startcontinentcode`` when you're listing countries or countries with their subdivisions.

    

  
  :type StartCountryCode: string
  :param StartCountryCode: 

    The code for the country with which you want to start listing locations that Amazon Route 53 supports for geolocation. If Route 53 has already returned a page or more of results, if ``IsTruncated`` is ``true``, and if ``NextCountryCode`` from the previous response has a value, enter that value in ``startcountrycode`` to return the next page of results.

    

  
  :type StartSubdivisionCode: string
  :param StartSubdivisionCode: 

    The code for the state of the United States with which you want to start listing locations that Amazon Route 53 supports for geolocation. If Route 53 has already returned a page or more of results, if ``IsTruncated`` is ``true``, and if ``NextSubdivisionCode`` from the previous response has a value, enter that value in ``startsubdivisioncode`` to return the next page of results.

     

    To list subdivisions (U.S. states), you must include both ``startcountrycode`` and ``startsubdivisioncode``.

    

  
  :type MaxItems: string
  :param MaxItems: 

    (Optional) The maximum number of geolocations to be included in the response body for this request. If more than ``maxitems`` geolocations remain to be listed, then the value of the ``IsTruncated`` element in the response is ``true``.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 

      A complex type containing the response information for the request.

      
      

      - **GeoLocationDetailsList** *(list) --* 

        A complex type that contains one ``GeoLocationDetails`` element for each location that Amazon Route 53 supports for geolocation.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          A complex type that contains the codes and full continent, country, and subdivision names for the specified ``geolocation`` code.

          
          

          - **ContinentCode** *(string) --* 

            The two-letter code for the continent.

            
          

          - **ContinentName** *(string) --* 

            The full name of the continent.

            
          

          - **CountryCode** *(string) --* 

            The two-letter code for the country.

            
          

          - **CountryName** *(string) --* 

            The name of the country.

            
          

          - **SubdivisionCode** *(string) --* 

            The code for the subdivision, such as a particular state within the United States. For a list of US state abbreviations, see `Appendix B\: Two–Letter State and Possession Abbreviations <https://pe.usps.com/text/pub28/28apb.htm>`__ on the United States Postal Service website. For a list of all supported subdivision codes, use the `ListGeoLocations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_ListGeoLocations.html>`__ API.

            
          

          - **SubdivisionName** *(string) --* 

            The full name of the subdivision. Route 53 currently supports only states in the United States.

            
      
    
      

      - **IsTruncated** *(boolean) --* 

        A value that indicates whether more locations remain to be listed after the last location in this response. If so, the value of ``IsTruncated`` is ``true``. To get more values, submit another request and include the values of ``NextContinentCode``, ``NextCountryCode``, and ``NextSubdivisionCode`` in the ``startcontinentcode``, ``startcountrycode``, and ``startsubdivisioncode``, as applicable.

        
      

      - **NextContinentCode** *(string) --* 

        If ``IsTruncated`` is ``true``, you can make a follow-up request to display more locations. Enter the value of ``NextContinentCode`` in the ``startcontinentcode`` parameter in another ``ListGeoLocations`` request.

        
      

      - **NextCountryCode** *(string) --* 

        If ``IsTruncated`` is ``true``, you can make a follow-up request to display more locations. Enter the value of ``NextCountryCode`` in the ``startcountrycode`` parameter in another ``ListGeoLocations`` request.

        
      

      - **NextSubdivisionCode** *(string) --* 

        If ``IsTruncated`` is ``true``, you can make a follow-up request to display more locations. Enter the value of ``NextSubdivisionCode`` in the ``startsubdivisioncode`` parameter in another ``ListGeoLocations`` request.

        
      

      - **MaxItems** *(string) --* 

        The value that you specified for ``MaxItems`` in the request.
