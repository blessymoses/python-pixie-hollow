.. py:method:: Route53.Client.disassociate_vpc_from_hosted_zone(**kwargs)

  

  Disassociates an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) from an Amazon Route 53 private hosted zone. Note the following:

   

  
  * You can't disassociate the last Amazon VPC from a private hosted zone.
   
  * You can't convert a private hosted zone into a public hosted zone.
   
  * You can submit a ``DisassociateVPCFromHostedZone`` request using either the account that created the hosted zone or the account that created the Amazon VPC.
   
  * Some services, such as Cloud Map and Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) automatically create hosted zones and associate VPCs with the hosted zones. A service can create a hosted zone using your account or using its own account. You can disassociate a VPC from a hosted zone only if the service created the hosted zone using your account. When you run `DisassociateVPCFromHostedZone <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_ListHostedZonesByVPC.html>`__, if the hosted zone has a value for ``OwningAccount``, you can use ``DisassociateVPCFromHostedZone``. If the hosted zone has a value for ``OwningService``, you can't use ``DisassociateVPCFromHostedZone``.
  

   

  .. note::

    

    When revoking access, the hosted zone and the Amazon VPC must belong to the same partition. A partition is a group of Amazon Web Services Regions. Each Amazon Web Services account is scoped to one partition.

     

    The following are the supported partitions:

     

    
    * ``aws`` - Amazon Web Services Regions
     
    * ``aws-cn`` - China Regions
     
    * ``aws-us-gov`` - Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region
    

     

    For more information, see `Access Management <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*.
