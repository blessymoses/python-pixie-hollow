.. py:method:: Route53.Client.list_traffic_policy_instances_by_policy(**kwargs)

  

  Gets information about the traffic policy instances that you created by using a specify traffic policy version.

   

  .. note::

    

    After you submit a ``CreateTrafficPolicyInstance`` or an ``UpdateTrafficPolicyInstance`` request, there's a brief delay while Amazon Route 53 creates the resource record sets that are specified in the traffic policy definition. For more information, see the ``State`` response element.

    

   

  Route 53 returns a maximum of 100 items in each response. If you have a lot of traffic policy instances, you can use the ``MaxItems`` parameter to list them in groups of up to 100.

        MaxItems='string'
    )
    
  :type TrafficPolicyId: string
  :param TrafficPolicyId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ID of the traffic policy for which you want to list traffic policy instances.

    

  
  :type TrafficPolicyVersion: integer
  :param TrafficPolicyVersion: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The version of the traffic policy for which you want to list traffic policy instances. The version must be associated with the traffic policy that is specified by ``TrafficPolicyId``.

    

  
  :type HostedZoneIdMarker: string
  :param HostedZoneIdMarker: 

    If the value of ``IsTruncated`` in the previous response was ``true``, you have more traffic policy instances. To get more traffic policy instances, submit another ``ListTrafficPolicyInstancesByPolicy`` request.

     

    For the value of ``hostedzoneid``, specify the value of ``HostedZoneIdMarker`` from the previous response, which is the hosted zone ID of the first traffic policy instance that Amazon Route 53 will return if you submit another request.

     

    If the value of ``IsTruncated`` in the previous response was ``false``, there are no more traffic policy instances to get.

    

  
  :type TrafficPolicyInstanceNameMarker: string
  :param TrafficPolicyInstanceNameMarker: 

    If the value of ``IsTruncated`` in the previous response was ``true``, you have more traffic policy instances. To get more traffic policy instances, submit another ``ListTrafficPolicyInstancesByPolicy`` request.

     

    For the value of ``trafficpolicyinstancename``, specify the value of ``TrafficPolicyInstanceNameMarker`` from the previous response, which is the name of the first traffic policy instance that Amazon Route 53 will return if you submit another request.

     

    If the value of ``IsTruncated`` in the previous response was ``false``, there are no more traffic policy instances to get.

    

  
  :type TrafficPolicyInstanceTypeMarker: string
  :param TrafficPolicyInstanceTypeMarker: 

    If the value of ``IsTruncated`` in the previous response was ``true``, you have more traffic policy instances. To get more traffic policy instances, submit another ``ListTrafficPolicyInstancesByPolicy`` request.

     

    For the value of ``trafficpolicyinstancetype``, specify the value of ``TrafficPolicyInstanceTypeMarker`` from the previous response, which is the name of the first traffic policy instance that Amazon Route 53 will return if you submit another request.

     

    If the value of ``IsTruncated`` in the previous response was ``false``, there are no more traffic policy instances to get.

    

  
  :type MaxItems: string
  :param MaxItems: 

    The maximum number of traffic policy instances to be included in the response body for this request. If you have more than ``MaxItems`` traffic policy instances, the value of the ``IsTruncated`` element in the response is ``true``, and the values of ``HostedZoneIdMarker``, ``TrafficPolicyInstanceNameMarker``, and ``TrafficPolicyInstanceTypeMarker`` represent the first traffic policy instance that Amazon Route 53 will return if you submit another request.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --*

        A list that contains one ``TrafficPolicyInstance`` element for each traffic policy instance that matches the elements in the request.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          A complex type that contains settings for the new traffic policy instance.

          
          

          - **Id** *(string) --* 

            The ID that Amazon Route 53 assigned to the new traffic policy instance.

            
          

          - **HostedZoneId** *(string) --*

              Creating  

            Route 53 is creating the resource record sets. Use ``GetTrafficPolicyInstance`` to confirm that the ``CreateTrafficPolicyInstance`` request completed successfully.

              Failed  

            Route 53 wasn't able to create or update the resource record sets. When the value of ``State`` is ``Failed``, see ``Message`` for an explanation of what caused the request to fail.

            
          

          - **Message** *(string) --*

        If ``IsTruncated`` is ``true``, ``HostedZoneIdMarker`` is the ID of the hosted zone of the first traffic policy instance in the next group of traffic policy instances.

        
      

      - **TrafficPolicyInstanceNameMarker** *(string) --* 

        If ``IsTruncated`` is ``true``, ``TrafficPolicyInstanceNameMarker`` is the name of the first traffic policy instance in the next group of ``MaxItems`` traffic policy instances.

        
      

      - **TrafficPolicyInstanceTypeMarker** *(string) --* 

        If ``IsTruncated`` is ``true``, ``TrafficPolicyInstanceTypeMarker`` is the DNS type of the resource record sets that are associated with the first traffic policy instance in the next group of ``MaxItems`` traffic policy instances.

        
      

      - **IsTruncated** *(boolean) --* 

        A flag that indicates whether there are more traffic policy instances to be listed. If the response was truncated, you can get the next group of traffic policy instances by calling ``ListTrafficPolicyInstancesByPolicy`` again and specifying the values of the ``HostedZoneIdMarker``, ``TrafficPolicyInstanceNameMarker``, and ``TrafficPolicyInstanceTypeMarker`` elements in the corresponding request parameters.
