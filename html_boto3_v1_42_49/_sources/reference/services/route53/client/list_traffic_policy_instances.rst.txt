.. py:method:: Route53.Client.list_traffic_policy_instances(**kwargs)

  

  Gets information about the traffic policy instances that you created by using the current Amazon Web Services account.

   

  .. note::

    

    After you submit an ``UpdateTrafficPolicyInstance`` request, there's a brief delay while Amazon Route 53 creates the resource record sets that are specified in the traffic policy definition. For more information, see the ``State`` response element.

    

   

  Route 53 returns a maximum of 100 items in each response. If you have a lot of traffic policy instances, you can use the ``MaxItems`` parameter to list them in groups of up to 100.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_traffic_policy_instances(
        HostedZoneIdMarker='string',
        TrafficPolicyInstanceNameMarker='string',
        TrafficPolicyInstanceTypeMarker='SOA'|'A'|'TXT'|'NS'|'CNAME'|'MX'|'NAPTR'|'PTR'|'SRV'|'SPF'|'AAAA'|'CAA'|'DS'|'TLSA'|'SSHFP'|'SVCB'|'HTTPS',
        MaxItems='string'
    )
    
  :type HostedZoneIdMarker: string
  :param HostedZoneIdMarker: 

    If the value of ``IsTruncated`` in the previous response was ``true``, you have more traffic policy instances. To get more traffic policy instances, submit another ``ListTrafficPolicyInstances`` request. For the value of ``HostedZoneId``, specify the value of ``HostedZoneIdMarker`` from the previous response, which is the hosted zone ID of the first traffic policy instance in the next group of traffic policy instances.

     

    If the value of ``IsTruncated`` in the previous response was ``false``, there are no more traffic policy instances to get.

    

  
  :type TrafficPolicyInstanceNameMarker: string
  :param TrafficPolicyInstanceNameMarker: 

    If the value of ``IsTruncated`` in the previous response was ``true``, you have more traffic policy instances. To get more traffic policy instances, submit another ``ListTrafficPolicyInstances`` request. For the value of ``trafficpolicyinstancename``, specify the value of ``TrafficPolicyInstanceNameMarker`` from the previous response, which is the name of the first traffic policy instance in the next group of traffic policy instances.

     

    If the value of ``IsTruncated`` in the previous response was ``false``, there are no more traffic policy instances to get.

    

  
  :type TrafficPolicyInstanceTypeMarker: string
  :param TrafficPolicyInstanceTypeMarker: 

    If the value of ``IsTruncated`` in the previous response was ``true``, you have more traffic policy instances. To get more traffic policy instances, submit another ``ListTrafficPolicyInstances`` request. For the value of ``trafficpolicyinstancetype``, specify the value of ``TrafficPolicyInstanceTypeMarker`` from the previous response, which is the type of the first traffic policy instance in the next group of traffic policy instances.

     

    If the value of ``IsTruncated`` in the previous response was ``false``, there are no more traffic policy instances to get.

    

  
  :type MaxItems: string
  :param MaxItems: 

    The maximum number of traffic policy instances that you want Amazon Route 53 to return in response to a ``ListTrafficPolicyInstances`` request. If you have more than ``MaxItems`` traffic policy instances, the value of the ``IsTruncated`` element in the response is ``true``, and the values of ``HostedZoneIdMarker``, ``TrafficPolicyInstanceNameMarker``, and ``TrafficPolicyInstanceTypeMarker`` represent the first traffic policy instance in the next group of ``MaxItems`` traffic policy instances.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 

      A complex type that contains the response information for the request.

      
      

      - **TrafficPolicyInstances** *(list) --* 

        A list that contains one ``TrafficPolicyInstance`` element for each traffic policy instance that matches the elements in the request.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          A complex type that contains settings for the new traffic policy instance.

          
          

          - **Id** *(string) --* 

            The ID that Amazon Route 53 assigned to the new traffic policy instance.

            
          

          - **HostedZoneId** *(string) --* 

            The ID of the hosted zone that Amazon Route 53 created resource record sets in.

            
          

          - **Name** *(string) --* 

            The DNS name, such as www.example.com, for which Amazon Route 53 responds to queries by using the resource record sets that are associated with this traffic policy instance.

            
          

          - **TTL** *(integer) --* 

            The TTL that Amazon Route 53 assigned to all of the resource record sets that it created in the specified hosted zone.

            
          

          - **State** *(string) --* 

            The value of ``State`` is one of the following values:

            Amazon Route 53 has finished creating resource record sets, and changes have propagated to all Route 53 edge locations.

              Creating  

            Route 53 is creating the resource record sets. Use ``GetTrafficPolicyInstance`` to confirm that the ``CreateTrafficPolicyInstance`` request completed successfully.

              Failed  

            Route 53 wasn't able to create or update the resource record sets. When the value of ``State`` is ``Failed``, see ``Message`` for an explanation of what caused the request to fail.

            
          

          - **Message** *(string) --*

      - **HostedZoneIdMarker** *(string) --* 

        If ``IsTruncated`` is ``true``, ``HostedZoneIdMarker`` is the ID of the hosted zone of the first traffic policy instance that Route 53 will return if you submit another ``ListTrafficPolicyInstances`` request.

        
      

      - **TrafficPolicyInstanceNameMarker** *(string) --* 

        If ``IsTruncated`` is ``true``, ``TrafficPolicyInstanceNameMarker`` is the name of the first traffic policy instance that Route 53 will return if you submit another ``ListTrafficPolicyInstances`` request.

        
      

      - **TrafficPolicyInstanceTypeMarker** *(string) --* 

        If ``IsTruncated`` is ``true``, ``TrafficPolicyInstanceTypeMarker`` is the DNS type of the resource record sets that are associated with the first traffic policy instance that Amazon Route 53 will return if you submit another ``ListTrafficPolicyInstances`` request.

        
      

      - **IsTruncated** *(boolean) --* 

        A flag that indicates whether there are more traffic policy instances to be listed. If the response was truncated, you can get more traffic policy instances by calling ``ListTrafficPolicyInstances`` again and specifying the values of the ``HostedZoneIdMarker``, ``TrafficPolicyInstanceNameMarker``, and ``TrafficPolicyInstanceTypeMarker`` in the corresponding request parameters.

        
      

      - **MaxItems** *(string) --* 

        The value that you specified for the ``MaxItems`` parameter in the call to ``ListTrafficPolicyInstances`` that produced the current response.
