.. py:method:: Route53.Client.list_traffic_policy_instances_by_hosted_zone(**kwargs)

  

  Gets information about the traffic policy instances that you created in a specified hosted zone.

   

  .. note::

    

    After you submit a ``CreateTrafficPolicyInstance`` or an ``UpdateTrafficPolicyInstance`` request, there's a brief delay while Amazon Route 53 creates the resource record sets that are specified in the traffic policy definition. For more information, see the ``State`` response element.

    

   

  Route 53 returns a maximum of 100 items in each response. If you have a lot of traffic policy instances, you can use the ``MaxItems`` parameter to list them in groups of up to 100.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_traffic_policy_instances_by_hosted_zone(
        HostedZoneId='string',
        TrafficPolicyInstanceNameMarker='string',
        TrafficPolicyInstanceTypeMarker='SOA'|'A'|'TXT'|'NS'|'CNAME'|'MX'|'NAPTR'|'PTR'|'SRV'|'SPF'|'AAAA'|'CAA'|'DS'|'TLSA'|'SSHFP'|'SVCB'|'HTTPS',
        MaxItems='string'
    )
    
  :type HostedZoneId: string
  :param HostedZoneId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ID of the hosted zone that you want to list traffic policy instances for.

    

  
  :type TrafficPolicyInstanceNameMarker: string
  :param TrafficPolicyInstanceNameMarker: 

    If the value of ``IsTruncated`` in the previous response is true, you have more traffic policy instances. To get more traffic policy instances, submit another ``ListTrafficPolicyInstances`` request. For the value of ``trafficpolicyinstancename``, specify the value of ``TrafficPolicyInstanceNameMarker`` from the previous response, which is the name of the first traffic policy instance in the next group of traffic policy instances.

     

    If the value of ``IsTruncated`` in the previous response was ``false``, there are no more traffic policy instances to get.

    

  
  :type TrafficPolicyInstanceTypeMarker: string
  :param TrafficPolicyInstanceTypeMarker: 

    If the value of ``IsTruncated`` in the previous response is true, you have more traffic policy instances. To get more traffic policy instances, submit another ``ListTrafficPolicyInstances`` request. For the value of ``trafficpolicyinstancetype``, specify the value of ``TrafficPolicyInstanceTypeMarker`` from the previous response, which is the type of the first traffic policy instance in the next group of traffic policy instances.

     

    If the value of ``IsTruncated`` in the previous response was ``false``, there are no more traffic policy instances to get.

    

  
  :type MaxItems: string
  :param MaxItems: 

    The maximum number of traffic policy instances to be included in the response body for this request. If you have more than ``MaxItems`` traffic policy instances, the value of the ``IsTruncated`` element in the response is ``true``, and the values of ``HostedZoneIdMarker``, ``TrafficPolicyInstanceNameMarker``, and ``TrafficPolicyInstanceTypeMarker`` represent the first traffic policy instance that Amazon Route 53 will return if you submit another request.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 

      A complex type that contains the response information for the request.

      
      

      - **TrafficPolicyInstances** *(list) --* 

        A list that contains one ``TrafficPolicyInstance`` element for each traffic policy instance that matches the elements in the request.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          A complex type that contains settings for the new traffic policy instance.

          
          

          - **Id** *(string) --* 

            The ID that Amazon Route 53 assigned to the new traffic policy instance.

            
          

          - **HostedZoneId** *(string) --* 

            The ID of the hosted zone that Amazon Route 53 created resource record sets in.

            
          

          - **Name** *(string) --* 

            The DNS name, such as www.example.com, for which Amazon Route 53 responds to queries by using the resource record sets that are associated with this traffic policy instance.

            
          

          - **TTL** *(integer) --* 

            The TTL that Amazon Route 53 assigned to all of the resource record sets that it created in the specified hosted zone.

            
          

          - **State** *(string) --* 

            The value of ``State`` is one of the following values:

              Applied  

            Amazon Route 53 has finished creating resource record sets, and changes have propagated to all Route 53 edge locations.

              Creating  

            Route 53 is creating the resource record sets. Use ``GetTrafficPolicyInstance`` to confirm that the ``CreateTrafficPolicyInstance`` request completed successfully.

              Failed  

            Route 53 wasn't able to create or update the resource record sets. When the value of ``State`` is ``Failed``, see ``Message`` for an explanation of what caused the request to fail.

            
          

          - **Message** *(string) --* 

            If ``State`` is ``Failed``, an explanation of the reason for the failure. If ``State`` is another value, ``Message`` is empty.

            
          

          - **TrafficPolicyId** *(string) --* 

            The ID of the traffic policy that Amazon Route 53 used to create resource record sets in the specified hosted zone.

            
          

          - **TrafficPolicyVersion** *(integer) --* 

            The version of the traffic policy that Amazon Route 53 used to create resource record sets in the specified hosted zone.

            
          

          - **TrafficPolicyType** *(string) --* 

            The DNS type that Amazon Route 53 assigned to all of the resource record sets that it created for this traffic policy instance.

            
      
    
      

      - **TrafficPolicyInstanceNameMarker** *(string) --* 

        If ``IsTruncated`` is ``true``, ``TrafficPolicyInstanceNameMarker`` is the name of the first traffic policy instance in the next group of traffic policy instances.

        
      

      - **TrafficPolicyInstanceTypeMarker** *(string) --* 

        If ``IsTruncated`` is true, ``TrafficPolicyInstanceTypeMarker`` is the DNS type of the resource record sets that are associated with the first traffic policy instance in the next group of traffic policy instances.

        
      

      - **IsTruncated** *(boolean) --* 

        A flag that indicates whether there are more traffic policy instances to be listed. If the response was truncated, you can get the next group of traffic policy instances by submitting another ``ListTrafficPolicyInstancesByHostedZone`` request and specifying the values of ``HostedZoneIdMarker``, ``TrafficPolicyInstanceNameMarker``, and ``TrafficPolicyInstanceTypeMarker`` in the corresponding request parameters.

        
      

      - **MaxItems** *(string) --* 

        The value that you specified for the ``MaxItems`` parameter in the ``ListTrafficPolicyInstancesByHostedZone`` request that produced the current response.
