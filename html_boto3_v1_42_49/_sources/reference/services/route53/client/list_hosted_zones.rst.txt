.. py:method:: Route53.Client.list_hosted_zones(**kwargs)

  

  Retrieves a list of the public and private hosted zones that are associated with the current Amazon Web Services account. The response includes a ``HostedZones`` child element for each hosted zone.

   

  Amazon Route 53 returns a maximum of 100 items in each response. If you have a lot of hosted zones, you can use the ``maxitems`` parameter to list them in groups of up to 100.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_hosted_zones(
        Marker='string',
        MaxItems='string',
        DelegationSetId='string',
        HostedZoneType='PrivateHostedZone'
    )
    
  :type Marker: string
  :param Marker: 

    If the value of ``IsTruncated`` in the previous response was ``true``, you have more hosted zones. To get more hosted zones, submit another ``ListHostedZones`` request.

     

    For the value of ``marker``, specify the value of ``NextMarker`` from the previous response, which is the ID of the first hosted zone that Amazon Route 53 will return if you submit another request.

     

    If the value of ``IsTruncated`` in the previous response was ``false``, there are no more hosted zones to get.

    

  
  :type MaxItems: string
  :param MaxItems: 

    (Optional) The maximum number of hosted zones that you want Amazon Route 53 to return. If you have more than ``maxitems`` hosted zones, the value of ``IsTruncated`` in the response is ``true``, and the value of ``NextMarker`` is the hosted zone ID of the first hosted zone that Route 53 will return if you submit another request.

    

  
  :type DelegationSetId: string
  :param DelegationSetId: 

    If you're using reusable delegation sets and you want to list all of the hosted zones that are associated with a reusable delegation set, specify the ID of that reusable delegation set.

    

  
  :type HostedZoneType: string
  :param HostedZoneType: 

    (Optional) Specifies if the hosted zone is private.
