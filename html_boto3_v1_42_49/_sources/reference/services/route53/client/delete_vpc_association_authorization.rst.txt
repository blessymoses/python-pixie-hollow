.. py:method:: Route53.Client.delete_vpc_association_authorization(**kwargs)

  

  Removes authorization to submit an ``AssociateVPCWithHostedZone`` request to associate a specified VPC with a hosted zone that was created by a different account. You must use the account that created the hosted zone to submit a ``DeleteVPCAssociationAuthorization`` request.

   

  .. warning::

     

    Sending this request only prevents the Amazon Web Services account that created the VPC from associating the VPC with the Amazon Route 53 hosted zone in the future. If the VPC is already associated with the hosted zone, ``DeleteVPCAssociationAuthorization`` won't disassociate the VPC from the hosted zone. If you want to delete an existing association, use ``DisassociateVPCFromHostedZone``.
