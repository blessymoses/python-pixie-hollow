.. py:method:: Route53.Client.delete_traffic_policy(**kwargs)

  

  Deletes a traffic policy.

   

  When you delete a traffic policy, Route 53 sets a flag on the policy to indicate that it has been deleted. However, Route 53 never fully deletes the traffic policy. Note the following:

   

  
  * Deleted traffic policies aren't listed if you run `ListTrafficPolicies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_ListTrafficPolicies.html>`__.
   
  * There's no way to get a list of deleted policies.
   
  * If you retain the ID of the policy, you can get information about the policy, including the traffic policy document, by running `GetTrafficPolicy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_GetTrafficPolicy.html>`__.
