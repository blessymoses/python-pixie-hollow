.. py:method:: Route53.Client.list_vpc_association_authorizations(**kwargs)

  

  Gets a list of the VPCs that were created by other accounts and that can be associated with a specified hosted zone because you've submitted one or more ``CreateVPCAssociationAuthorization`` requests.

   

  The response includes a ``VPCs`` element with a ``VPC`` child element for each VPC that can be associated with the hosted zone.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_vpc_association_authorizations(
        HostedZoneId='string',
        NextToken='string',
        MaxResults='string'
    )
    
  :type HostedZoneId: string
  :param HostedZoneId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ID of the hosted zone for which you want a list of VPCs that can be associated with the hosted zone.

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    *Optional*: If a response includes a ``NextToken`` element, there are more VPCs that can be associated with the specified hosted zone. To get the next page of results, submit another request, and include the value of ``NextToken`` from the response in the ``nexttoken`` parameter in another ``ListVPCAssociationAuthorizations`` request.

    

  
  :type MaxResults: string
  :param MaxResults: 

    *Optional*: An integer that specifies the maximum number of VPCs that you want Amazon Route 53 to return. If you don't specify a value for ``MaxResults``, Route 53 returns up to 50 VPCs per page.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 

      A complex type that contains the response information for the request.

      
      

      - **HostedZoneId** *(string) --* 

        The ID of the hosted zone that you can associate the listed VPCs with.

        
      

      - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

        When the response includes a ``NextToken`` element, there are more VPCs that can be associated with the specified hosted zone. To get the next page of VPCs, submit another ``ListVPCAssociationAuthorizations`` request, and include the value of the ``NextToken`` element from the response in the ``nexttoken`` request parameter.

        
      

      - **VPCs** *(list) --* 

        The list of VPCs that are authorized to be associated with the specified hosted zone.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          (Private hosted zones only) A complex type that contains information about an Amazon VPC.

           

          If you associate a private hosted zone with an Amazon VPC when you make a `CreateHostedZone <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_CreateHostedZone.html>`__ request, the following parameters are also required.

          
          

          - **VPCRegion** *(string) --* 

            (Private hosted zones only) The region that an Amazon VPC was created in.

            
          

          - **VPCId** *(string) --* 

            (Private hosted zones only) The ID of an Amazon VPC.
