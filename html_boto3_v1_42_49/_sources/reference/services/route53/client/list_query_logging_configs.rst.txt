.. py:method:: Route53.Client.list_query_logging_configs(**kwargs)

  

  Lists the configurations for DNS query logging that are associated with the current Amazon Web Services account or the configuration that is associated with a specified hosted zone.

   

  For more information about DNS query logs, see `CreateQueryLoggingConfig <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_CreateQueryLoggingConfig.html>`__. Additional information, including the format of DNS query logs, appears in `Logging DNS Queries <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/query-logs.html>`__ in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide*.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_query_logging_configs(
        HostedZoneId='string',
        NextToken='string',
        MaxResults='string'
    )
    
  :type HostedZoneId: string
  :param HostedZoneId: 

    (Optional) If you want to list the query logging configuration that is associated with a hosted zone, specify the ID in ``HostedZoneId``.

     

    If you don't specify a hosted zone ID, ``ListQueryLoggingConfigs`` returns all of the configurations that are associated with the current Amazon Web Services account.

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    (Optional) If the current Amazon Web Services account has more than ``MaxResults`` query logging configurations, use ``NextToken`` to get the second and subsequent pages of results.

     

    For the first ``ListQueryLoggingConfigs`` request, omit this value.

     

    For the second and subsequent requests, get the value of ``NextToken`` from the previous response and specify that value for ``NextToken`` in the request.

    

  
  :type MaxResults: string
  :param MaxResults: 

    (Optional) The maximum number of query logging configurations that you want Amazon Route 53 to return in response to the current request. If the current Amazon Web Services account has more than ``MaxResults`` configurations, use the value of `NextToken <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_ListQueryLoggingConfigs.html#API_ListQueryLoggingConfigs_RequestSyntax>`__ in the response to get the next page of results.

     

    If you don't specify a value for ``MaxResults``, Route 53 returns up to 100 configurations.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **QueryLoggingConfigs** *(list) --* 

        An array that contains one `QueryLoggingConfig <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_QueryLoggingConfig.html>`__ element for each configuration for DNS query logging that is associated with the current Amazon Web Services account.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          A complex type that contains information about a configuration for DNS query logging.

          
          

          - **Id** *(string) --* 

            The ID for a configuration for DNS query logging.

            
          

          - **HostedZoneId** *(string) --* 

            The ID of the hosted zone that CloudWatch Logs is logging queries for.

            
          

          - **CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CloudWatch Logs log group that Amazon Route 53 is publishing logs to.

            
      
    
      

      - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

        If a response includes the last of the query logging configurations that are associated with the current Amazon Web Services account, ``NextToken`` doesn't appear in the response.

         

        If a response doesn't include the last of the configurations, you can get more configurations by submitting another `ListQueryLoggingConfigs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_ListQueryLoggingConfigs.html>`__ request. Get the value of ``NextToken`` that Amazon Route 53 returned in the previous response and include it in ``NextToken`` in the next request.
