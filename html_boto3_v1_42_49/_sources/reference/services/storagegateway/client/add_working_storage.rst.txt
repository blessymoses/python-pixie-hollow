.. py:method:: StorageGateway.Client.add_working_storage(**kwargs)

  

  Configures one or more gateway local disks as working storage for a gateway. This operation is only supported in the stored volume gateway type. This operation is deprecated in cached volume API version 20120630. Use  AddUploadBuffer instead.

   

  .. note::

    

    Working storage is also referred to as upload buffer. You can also use the  AddUploadBuffer operation to add upload buffer to a stored volume gateway.

    

   

  In the request, you specify the gateway Amazon Resource Name (ARN) to which you want to add working storage, and one or more disk IDs that you want to configure as working storage.
