.. py:method:: StorageGateway.Client.update_smb_file_share(**kwargs)

  

  Updates a Server Message Block (SMB) file share. This operation is only supported for S3 File Gateways.

   

  .. note::

    

    To leave a file share field unchanged, set the corresponding input field to null.

    

   

  .. warning::

     

    File gateways require Security Token Service (Amazon Web Services STS) to be activated to enable you to create a file share. Make sure that Amazon Web Services STS is activated in the Amazon Web Services Region you are creating your file gateway in. If Amazon Web Services STS is not activated in this Amazon Web Services Region, activate it. For information about how to activate Amazon Web Services STS, see `Activating and deactivating Amazon Web Services STS in an Amazon Web Services Region <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_enable-regions.html>`__ in the *Identity and Access Management User Guide*.

     

    File gateways don't support creating hard or symbolic links on a file share.

  :type FileShareARN: string
  :param FileShareARN: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the SMB file share that you want to update.

    

  
  :type EncryptionType: string
  :param EncryptionType: 

    A value that specifies the type of server-side encryption that the file share will use for the data that it stores in Amazon S3.

     

    .. note::

      

      We recommend using ``EncryptionType`` instead of ``KMSEncrypted`` to set the file share encryption method. You do not need to provide values for both parameters.

       

      If values for both parameters exist in the same request, then the specified encryption methods must not conflict. For example, if ``EncryptionType`` is ``SseS3``, then ``KMSEncrypted`` must be ``false``. If ``EncryptionType`` is ``SseKms`` or ``DsseKms``, then ``KMSEncrypted`` must be ``true``.

      

    

  
  :type KMSEncrypted: boolean
  :param KMSEncrypted: 

    Optional. Set to ``true`` to use Amazon S3 server-side encryption with your own KMS key (SSE-KMS), or ``false`` to use a key managed by Amazon S3 (SSE-S3). To use dual-layer encryption (DSSE-KMS), set the ``EncryptionType`` parameter instead.

     

    .. note::

      

      We recommend using ``EncryptionType`` instead of ``KMSEncrypted`` to set the file share encryption method. You do not need to provide values for both parameters.

       

      If values for both parameters exist in the same request, then the specified encryption methods must not conflict. For example, if ``EncryptionType`` is ``SseS3``, then ``KMSEncrypted`` must be ``false``. If ``EncryptionType`` is ``SseKms`` or ``DsseKms``, then ``KMSEncrypted`` must be ``true``.

      

     

    Valid Values: ``true`` | ``false``

    

  
  :type KMSKey: string
  :param KMSKey: 

    Optional. The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a symmetric customer master key (CMK) used for Amazon S3 server-side encryption. Storage Gateway does not support asymmetric CMKs. This value must be set if ``KMSEncrypted`` is ``true``, or if ``EncryptionType`` is ``SseKms`` or ``DsseKms``.

    

  
  :type DefaultStorageClass: string
  :param DefaultStorageClass: 

    The default storage class for objects put into an Amazon S3 bucket by the S3 File Gateway. The default value is ``S3_STANDARD``. Optional.

     

    Valid Values: ``S3_STANDARD`` | ``S3_INTELLIGENT_TIERING`` | ``S3_STANDARD_IA`` | ``S3_ONEZONE_IA``

    

  
  :type ObjectACL: string
  :param ObjectACL: 

    A value that sets the access control list (ACL) permission for objects in the S3 bucket that a S3 File Gateway puts objects into. The default value is ``private``.

    

  
  :type ReadOnly: boolean
  :param ReadOnly: 

    A value that sets the write status of a file share. Set this value to ``true`` to set write status to read-only, otherwise set to ``false``.

     

    Valid Values: ``true`` | ``false``

    

  
  :type GuessMIMETypeEnabled: boolean
  :param GuessMIMETypeEnabled: 

    A value that enables guessing of the MIME type for uploaded objects based on file extensions. Set this value to ``true`` to enable MIME type guessing, otherwise set to ``false``. The default value is ``true``.

     

    Valid Values: ``true`` | ``false``

    

  
  :type RequesterPays: boolean
  :param RequesterPays: 

    A value that sets who pays the cost of the request and the cost associated with data download from the S3 bucket. If this value is set to ``true``, the requester pays the costs; otherwise, the S3 bucket owner pays. However, the S3 bucket owner always pays the cost of storing data.

     

    .. note::

      

      ``RequesterPays`` is a configuration for the S3 bucket that backs the file share, so make sure that the configuration on the file share is the same as the S3 bucket configuration.

      

     

    Valid Values: ``true`` | ``false``

    

  
  :type SMBACLEnabled: boolean
  :param SMBACLEnabled: 

    Set this value to ``true`` to enable access control list (ACL) on the SMB file share. Set it to ``false`` to map file and directory permissions to the POSIX permissions.

     

    For more information, see `Using Windows ACLs to limit SMB file share access <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/filegateway/latest/files3/smb-acl.html>`__ in the *Amazon S3 File Gateway User Guide*.

     

    Valid Values: ``true`` | ``false``

    

  
  :type AccessBasedEnumeration: boolean
  :param AccessBasedEnumeration: 

    The files and folders on this share will only be visible to users with read access.

    

  
  :type AdminUserList: list
  :param AdminUserList: 

    A list of users or groups in the Active Directory that have administrator rights to the file share. A group must be prefixed with the @ character. Acceptable formats include: ``DOMAIN\User1``, ``user1``, ``@group1``, and ``@DOMAIN\group1``. Can only be set if Authentication is set to ``ActiveDirectory``.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type ValidUserList: list
  :param ValidUserList: 

    A list of users or groups in the Active Directory that are allowed to access the file share. A group must be prefixed with the @ character. Acceptable formats include: ``DOMAIN\User1``, ``user1``, ``@group1``, and ``@DOMAIN\group1``. Can only be set if Authentication is set to ``ActiveDirectory``.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type InvalidUserList: list
  :param InvalidUserList: 

    A list of users or groups in the Active Directory that are not allowed to access the file share. A group must be prefixed with the @ character. Acceptable formats include: ``DOMAIN\User1``, ``user1``, ``@group1``, and ``@DOMAIN\group1``. Can only be set if Authentication is set to ``ActiveDirectory``.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type AuditDestinationARN: string
  :param AuditDestinationARN: 

    The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the storage used for audit logs.

    

  
  :type CaseSensitivity: string
  :param CaseSensitivity: 

    The case of an object name in an Amazon S3 bucket. For ``ClientSpecified``, the client determines the case sensitivity. For ``CaseSensitive``, the gateway determines the case sensitivity. The default value is ``ClientSpecified``.

    

  
  :type FileShareName: string
  :param FileShareName: 

    The name of the file share. Optional.

     

    .. note::

      

      ``FileShareName`` must be set if an S3 prefix name is set in ``LocationARN``, or if an access point or access point alias is used.

       

      A valid SMB file share name cannot contain the following characters: ``[``, ``]``, ``#``, ``;``, ``<``, ``>``, ``:``, ``"``, ``\``, ``/``, ``|``, ``?``, ``*``, ``+``, or ASCII control characters ``1-31``.

      

    

  
  :type CacheAttributes: dict
  :param CacheAttributes: 

    Specifies refresh cache information for the file share.

    

  
    - **CacheStaleTimeoutInSeconds** *(integer) --* 

      Refreshes a file share's cache by using Time To Live (TTL). TTL is the length of time since the last refresh after which access to the directory would cause the file gateway to first refresh that directory's contents from the Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon FSx file system. The TTL duration is in seconds.

       

      Valid Values:0, 300 to 2,592,000 seconds (5 minutes to 30 days)

      

    
  
  :type NotificationPolicy: string
  :param NotificationPolicy: 

    The notification policy of the file share. ``SettlingTimeInSeconds`` controls the number of seconds to wait after the last point in time a client wrote to a file before generating an ``ObjectUploaded`` notification. Because clients can make many small writes to files, it's best to set this parameter for as long as possible to avoid generating multiple notifications for the same file in a small time period.

     

    .. note::

      

      ``SettlingTimeInSeconds`` has no effect on the timing of the object uploading to Amazon S3, only the timing of the notification.

       

      This setting is not meant to specify an exact time at which the notification will be sent. In some cases, the gateway might require more than the specified delay time to generate and send notifications.

      

     

    The following example sets ``NotificationPolicy`` on with ``SettlingTimeInSeconds`` set to 60.

     

    ``{\"Upload\": {\"SettlingTimeInSeconds\": 60}}``

     

    The following example sets ``NotificationPolicy`` off.

     

    ``{}``

    

  
  :type OplocksEnabled: boolean
  :param OplocksEnabled: 

    Specifies whether opportunistic locking is enabled for the SMB file share.

     

    .. note::

      

      Enabling opportunistic locking on case-sensitive shares is not recommended for workloads that involve access to files with the same name in different case.

      

     

    Valid Values: ``true`` | ``false``
