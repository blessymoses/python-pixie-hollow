.. py:method:: StorageGateway.Client.activate_gateway(**kwargs)

  

  Activates the gateway you previously deployed on your host. In the activation process, you specify information such as the Amazon Web Services Region that you want to use for storing snapshots or tapes, the time zone for scheduled snapshots the gateway snapshot schedule window, an activation key, and a name for your gateway. The activation process also associates your gateway with your account. For more information, see  UpdateGatewayInformation.

   

  .. note::

    

    You must turn on the gateway VM before you can activate your gateway.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.activate_gateway(
        ActivationKey='string',
        GatewayName='string',
        GatewayTimezone='string',
        GatewayRegion='string',
        GatewayType='string',
        TapeDriveType='string',
        MediumChangerType='string',
        Tags=[
            {
                'Key': 'string',
                'Value': 'string'
            },
        ]
    )
    
  :type ActivationKey: string
  :param ActivationKey: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Your gateway activation key. You can obtain the activation key by sending an HTTP GET request with redirects enabled to the gateway IP address (port 80). The redirect URL returned in the response provides you the activation key for your gateway in the query string parameter ``activationKey``. It may also include other activation-related parameters, however, these are merely defaults -- the arguments you pass to the ``ActivateGateway`` API call determine the actual configuration of your gateway.

     

    For more information, see `Getting activation key <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/get-activation-key.html>`__ in the *Storage Gateway User Guide*.

    

  
  :type GatewayName: string
  :param GatewayName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name you configured for your gateway.

    

  
  :type GatewayTimezone: string
  :param GatewayTimezone: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A value that indicates the time zone you want to set for the gateway. The time zone is of the format "GMT", "GMT-hr:mm", or "GMT+hr:mm". For example, GMT indicates Greenwich Mean Time without any offset. GMT-4:00 indicates the time is 4 hours behind GMT. GMT+2:00 indicates the time is 2 hours ahead of GMT. The time zone is used, for example, for scheduling snapshots and your gateway's maintenance schedule.

    

  
  :type GatewayRegion: string
  :param GatewayRegion: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A value that indicates the Amazon Web Services Region where you want to store your data. The gateway Amazon Web Services Region specified must be the same Amazon Web Services Region as the Amazon Web Services Region in your ``Host`` header in the request. For more information about available Amazon Web Services Regions and endpoints for Storage Gateway, see `Storage Gateway endpoints and quotas <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sg.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*.

     

    Valid Values: See `Storage Gateway endpoints and quotas <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sg.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*.

    

  
  :type GatewayType: string
  :param GatewayType: 

    A value that defines the type of gateway to activate. The type specified is critical to all later functions of the gateway and cannot be changed after activation. The default value is ``CACHED``.

  :type Tags: list
  :param Tags: 

    A list of up to 50 tags that you can assign to the gateway. Each tag is a key-value pair.

     

    .. note::

      

      Valid characters for key and value are letters, spaces, and numbers that can be represented in UTF-8 format, and the following special characters: + - = . _ : / @.

    **Response Syntax**

    
    ::

      {
          'GatewayARN': 'string'
      }
      
    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 

      Storage Gateway returns the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the activated gateway. It is a string made of information such as your account, gateway name, and Amazon Web Services Region. This ARN is used to reference the gateway in other API operations as well as resource-based authorization.

       

      .. note::

        

        For gateways activated prior to September 02, 2015, the gateway ARN contains the gateway name rather than the gateway ID. Changing the name of the gateway has no effect on the gateway ARN.

        

      
      

      - **GatewayARN** *(string) --* 

        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways operation to return a list of gateways for your account and Amazon Web Services Region.

        
  
  **Exceptions**
  
  *   :py:class:`StorageGateway.Client.exceptions.InvalidGatewayRequestException`

  
  *   :py:class:`StorageGateway.Client.exceptions.InternalServerError`
