.. py:method:: StorageGateway.Client.list_gateways(**kwargs)

  

  Lists gateways owned by an Amazon Web Services account in an Amazon Web Services Region specified in the request. The returned list is ordered by gateway Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

   

  By default, the operation returns a maximum of 100 gateways. This operation supports pagination that allows you to optionally reduce the number of gateways returned in a response.

   

  If you have more gateways than are returned in a response (that is, the response returns only a truncated list of your gateways), the response contains a marker that you can specify in your next request to fetch the next page of gateways.
