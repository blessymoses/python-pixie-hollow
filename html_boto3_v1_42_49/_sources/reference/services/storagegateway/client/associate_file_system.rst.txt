  :type Tags: list
  :param Tags: 

    A list of up to 50 tags that can be assigned to the file system association. Each tag is a key-value pair.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      A key-value pair that helps you manage, filter, and search for your resource. Allowed characters: letters, white space, and numbers, representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : /.
