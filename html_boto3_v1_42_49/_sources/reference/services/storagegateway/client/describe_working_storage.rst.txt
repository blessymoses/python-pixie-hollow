.. py:method:: StorageGateway.Client.describe_working_storage(**kwargs)

  

  Returns information about the working storage of a gateway. This operation is only supported in the stored volumes gateway type. This operation is deprecated in cached volumes API version (20120630). Use DescribeUploadBuffer instead.

   

  .. note::

    

    Working storage is also referred to as upload buffer. You can also use the DescribeUploadBuffer operation to add upload buffer to a stored volume gateway.

    

   

  The response includes disk IDs that are configured as working storage, and it includes the amount of working storage allocated and used.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.describe_working_storage(
        GatewayARN='string'
    )
    
  :type GatewayARN: string
  :param GatewayARN: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways operation to return a list of gateways for your account and Amazon Web Services Region.

    

  
  
  :rtype: dict

    **Response Syntax**

    
    ::

      {
          'GatewayARN': 'string',
          'DiskIds': [
              'string',
          ],
          'WorkingStorageUsedInBytes': 123,
          'WorkingStorageAllocatedInBytes': 123
      }
      
    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 

      A JSON object containing the following fields:

      
      

      - **GatewayARN** *(string) --* 

        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways operation to return a list of gateways for your account and Amazon Web Services Region.

        
      

      - **DiskIds** *(list) --* 

        An array of the gateway's local disk IDs that are configured as working storage. Each local disk ID is specified as a string (minimum length of 1 and maximum length of 300). If no local disks are configured as working storage, then the DiskIds array is empty.

        
        

        - *(string) --* 
    
      

      - **WorkingStorageUsedInBytes** *(integer) --* 

        The total working storage in bytes in use by the gateway. If no working storage is configured for the gateway, this field returns 0.

        
      

      - **WorkingStorageAllocatedInBytes** *(integer) --* 

        The total working storage in bytes allocated for the gateway. If no working storage is configured for the gateway, this field returns 0.

        
  
  **Exceptions**
  
  *   :py:class:`StorageGateway.Client.exceptions.InvalidGatewayRequestException`

  
  *   :py:class:`StorageGateway.Client.exceptions.InternalServerError`

  

  **Examples**

  This operation is supported only for the gateway-stored volume architecture. This operation is deprecated in cached-volumes API version (20120630). Use DescribeUploadBuffer instead.
