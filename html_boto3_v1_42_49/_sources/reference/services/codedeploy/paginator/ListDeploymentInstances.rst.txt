    :type deploymentId: string
    :param deploymentId: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The unique ID of a deployment.

      

    
    :type instanceStatusFilter: list
    :param instanceStatusFilter: 

      A subset of instances to list by status:

       

      
      * ``Pending``: Include those instances with pending deployments.
       
      * ``InProgress``: Include those instances where deployments are still in progress.
       
      * ``Succeeded``: Include those instances with successful deployments.
       
      * ``Failed``: Include those instances with failed deployments.
       
      * ``Skipped``: Include those instances with skipped deployments.
       
      * ``Unknown``: Include those instances with deployments in an unknown state.
      

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type instanceTypeFilter: list
    :param instanceTypeFilter: 

      The set of instances in a blue/green deployment, either those in the original environment ("BLUE") or those in the replacement environment ("GREEN"), for which you want to view instance information.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type PaginationConfig: dict
    :param PaginationConfig: 

      A dictionary that provides parameters to control pagination.

      

    
      - **MaxItems** *(integer) --* 

        The total number of items to return. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified in max-items then a ``NextToken`` will be provided in the output that you can use to resume pagination.

        

      
      - **StartingToken** *(string) --* 

        A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previous response.
