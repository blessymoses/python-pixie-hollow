.. py:method:: CodeDeploy.Client.delete_resources_by_external_id(**kwargs)

  

  Deletes resources linked to an external ID. This action only applies if you have configured blue/green deployments through CloudFormation.

   

  .. note::

    

    It is not necessary to call this action directly. CloudFormation calls it on your behalf when it needs to delete stack resources. This action is offered publicly in case you need to delete resources to comply with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requirements.
