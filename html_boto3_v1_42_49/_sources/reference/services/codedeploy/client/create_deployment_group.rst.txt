  :type terminationHookEnabled: boolean
  :param terminationHookEnabled: 

    This parameter only applies if you are using CodeDeploy with Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling. For more information, see `Integrating CodeDeploy with Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/integrations-aws-auto-scaling.html>`__ in the *CodeDeploy User Guide*.

     

    Set ``terminationHookEnabled`` to ``true`` to have CodeDeploy install a termination hook into your Auto Scaling group when you create a deployment group. When this hook is installed, CodeDeploy will perform termination deployments.

     

    For information about termination deployments, see `Enabling termination deployments during Auto Scaling scale-in events <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/integrations-aws-auto-scaling.html#integrations-aws-auto-scaling-behaviors-hook-enable>`__ in the *CodeDeploy User Guide*.

     

    For more information about Auto Scaling scale-in events, see the `Scale in <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-lifecycle.html#as-lifecycle-scale-in>`__ topic in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.
