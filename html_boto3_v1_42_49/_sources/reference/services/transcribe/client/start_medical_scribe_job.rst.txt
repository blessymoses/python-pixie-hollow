.. py:method:: TranscribeService.Client.start_medical_scribe_job(**kwargs)

  

  Transcribes patient-clinician conversations and generates clinical notes.

   

  Amazon Web Services HealthScribe automatically provides rich conversation transcripts, identifies speaker roles, classifies dialogues, extracts medical terms, and generates preliminary clinical notes. To learn more about these features, refer to `Amazon Web Services HealthScribe <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/health-scribe.html>`__.

   

  To make a ``StartMedicalScribeJob`` request, you must first upload your media file into an Amazon S3 bucket; you can then specify the Amazon S3 location of the file using the ``Media`` parameter.

   

  You must include the following parameters in your ``StartMedicalTranscriptionJob`` request:

   

  
  * ``DataAccessRoleArn``: The ARN of an IAM role with the these minimum permissions: read permission on input file Amazon S3 bucket specified in ``Media``, write permission on the Amazon S3 bucket specified in ``OutputBucketName``, and full permissions on the KMS key specified in ``OutputEncryptionKMSKeyId`` (if set). The role should also allow ``transcribe.amazonaws.com`` to assume it.
   
  * ``Media`` ( ``MediaFileUri``): The Amazon S3 location of your media file.
   
  * ``MedicalScribeJobName``: A custom name you create for your MedicalScribe job that is unique within your Amazon Web Services account.
   
  * ``OutputBucketName``: The Amazon S3 bucket where you want your output files stored.
   
  * ``Settings``: A ``MedicalScribeSettings`` object that must set exactly one of ``ShowSpeakerLabels`` or ``ChannelIdentification`` to true. If ``ShowSpeakerLabels`` is true, ``MaxSpeakerLabels`` must also be set.
   
  * ``ChannelDefinitions``: A ``MedicalScribeChannelDefinitions`` array should be set if and only if the ``ChannelIdentification`` value of ``Settings`` is set to true.

          Timestamps are in the format ``YYYY-MM-DD'T'HH:MM:SS.SSSSSS-UTC``. For example, ``2022-05-04T12:32:58.761000-07:00`` represents a Medical Scribe job that finished processing at 12:32 PM UTC-7 on May 4, 2022.

          
        

        - **FailureReason** *(string) --* 

          If ``MedicalScribeJobStatus`` is ``FAILED``, ``FailureReason`` contains information about why the transcription job failed. See also: `Common Errors <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/APIReference/CommonErrors.html>`__.

          
        

        - **Settings** *(dict) --* 

          Makes it possible to control how your Medical Scribe job is processed using a ``MedicalScribeSettings`` object. Specify ``ChannelIdentification`` if ``ChannelDefinitions`` are set. Enabled ``ShowSpeakerLabels`` if ``ChannelIdentification`` and ``ChannelDefinitions`` are not set. One and only one of ``ChannelIdentification`` and ``ShowSpeakerLabels`` must be set. If ``ShowSpeakerLabels`` is set, ``MaxSpeakerLabels`` must also be set. Use ``Settings`` to specify a vocabulary or vocabulary filter or both using ``VocabularyName``, ``VocabularyFilterName``. ``VocabularyFilterMethod`` must be specified if ``VocabularyFilterName`` is set.

          
          

          - **ShowSpeakerLabels** *(boolean) --* 

            Enables speaker partitioning (diarization) in your Medical Scribe output. Speaker partitioning labels the speech from individual speakers in your media file.

             

            If you enable ``ShowSpeakerLabels`` in your request, you must also include ``MaxSpeakerLabels``.

             

            For more information, see `Partitioning speakers (diarization) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/diarization.html>`__.

            
          

          - **MaxSpeakerLabels** *(integer) --* 

            Specify the maximum number of speakers you want to partition in your media.

             

            Note that if your media contains more speakers than the specified number, multiple speakers are treated as a single speaker.

             

            If you specify the ``MaxSpeakerLabels`` field, you must set the ``ShowSpeakerLabels`` field to true.

            
          

          - **ChannelIdentification** *(boolean) --* 

            Enables channel identification in multi-channel audio.

             

            Channel identification transcribes the audio on each channel independently, then appends the output for each channel into one transcript.

             

            For more information, see `Transcribing multi-channel audio <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/channel-id.html>`__.

          - **VocabularyFilterMethod** *(string) --* 

            Specify how you want your custom vocabulary filter applied to your transcript.

             

            To replace words with ``***``, choose ``mask``.

             

            To delete words, choose ``remove``.

             

            To flag words without changing them, choose ``tag``.

            
          

          - **ClinicalNoteGenerationSettings** *(dict) --* 

            Specify settings for the clinical note generation.

        - **ChannelDefinitions** *(list) --* 

          Makes it possible to specify which speaker is on which channel. For example, if the clinician is the first participant to speak, you would set ``ChannelId`` of the first ``ChannelDefinition`` in the list to ``0`` (to indicate the first channel) and ``ParticipantRole`` to ``CLINICIAN`` (to indicate that it's the clinician speaking). Then you would set the ``ChannelId`` of the second ``ChannelDefinition`` in the list to ``1`` (to indicate the second channel) and ``ParticipantRole`` to ``PATIENT`` (to indicate that it's the patient speaking).

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            Indicates which speaker is on which channel. The options are ``CLINICIAN`` and ``PATIENT``

          - *(dict) --* 

            Adds metadata, in the form of a key:value pair, to the specified resource.

             

            For example, you could add the tag ``Department:Sales`` to a resource to indicate that it pertains to your organization's sales department. You can also use tags for tag-based access control.

             

            To learn more about tagging, see `Tagging resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/tagging.html>`__.

            
            

            - **Key** *(string) --* 

              The first part of a key:value pair that forms a tag associated with a given resource. For example, in the tag ``Department:Sales``, the key is 'Department'.

              
            

            - **Value** *(string) --* 

              The second part of a key:value pair that forms a tag associated with a given resource. For example, in the tag ``Department:Sales``, the value is 'Sales'.

               

              Note that you can set the value of a tag to an empty string, but you can't set the value of a tag to null. Omitting the tag value is the same as using an empty string.
