.. py:method:: TranscribeService.Client.create_call_analytics_category(**kwargs)

  

  Creates a new Call Analytics category.

   

  All categories are automatically applied to your Call Analytics transcriptions. Note that in order to apply categories to your transcriptions, you must create them before submitting your transcription request, as categories cannot be applied retroactively.

   

  When creating a new category, you can use the ``InputType`` parameter to label the category as a ``POST_CALL`` or a ``REAL_TIME`` category. ``POST_CALL`` categories can only be applied to post-call transcriptions and ``REAL_TIME`` categories can only be applied to real-time transcriptions. If you do not include ``InputType``, your category is created as a ``POST_CALL`` category by default.

   

  Call Analytics categories are composed of rules. For each category, you must create between 1 and 20 rules. Rules can include these parameters: , , , and .

   

  To update an existing category, see .

  :type CategoryName: string
  :param CategoryName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A unique name, chosen by you, for your Call Analytics category. It's helpful to use a detailed naming system that will make sense to you in the future. For example, it's better to use ``sentiment-positive-last30seconds`` for a category over a generic name like ``test-category``.

     

    Category names are case sensitive.

    

  
  :type Rules: list
  :param Rules: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Rules define a Call Analytics category. When creating a new category, you must create between 1 and 20 rules for that category. For each rule, you specify a filter you want applied to the attributes of a call. For example, you can choose a sentiment filter that detects if a customer's sentiment was positive during the last 30 seconds of the call.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      A rule is a set of criteria that you can specify to flag an attribute in your Call Analytics output. Rules define a Call Analytics category.

       

      Rules can include these parameters: , , , and .

          Specify the participant that you want to flag. Omitting this parameter is equivalent to specifying both participants.

          

        
        - **Negate** *(boolean) --* 

          Set to ``TRUE`` to flag the sentiments that you didn't include in your request. Set to ``FALSE`` to flag the sentiments that you specified in your request.

          

        
      
    

  :type Tags: list
  :param Tags: 

    Adds one or more custom tags, each in the form of a key:value pair, to a new call analytics category at the time you start this new job.

     

    To learn more about using tags with Amazon Transcribe, refer to `Tagging resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/tagging.html>`__.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      Adds metadata, in the form of a key:value pair, to the specified resource.

       

      For example, you could add the tag ``Department:Sales`` to a resource to indicate that it pertains to your organization's sales department. You can also use tags for tag-based access control.

       

      To learn more about tagging, see `Tagging resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/tagging.html>`__.

      

    
      - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The first part of a key:value pair that forms a tag associated with a given resource. For example, in the tag ``Department:Sales``, the key is 'Department'.

        

      
      - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The second part of a key:value pair that forms a tag associated with a given resource. For example, in the tag ``Department:Sales``, the value is 'Sales'.

         

        Note that you can set the value of a tag to an empty string, but you can't set the value of a tag to null. Omitting the tag value is the same as using an empty string.

        

      
    

  :type InputType: string
  :param InputType: 

    Choose whether you want to create a real-time or a post-call category for your Call Analytics transcription.

     

    Specifying ``POST_CALL`` assigns your category to post-call transcriptions; categories with this input type cannot be applied to streaming (real-time) transcriptions.

     

    Specifying ``REAL_TIME`` assigns your category to streaming transcriptions; categories with this input type cannot be applied to post-call transcriptions.

     

    If you do not include ``InputType``, your category is created as a post-call category by default.
