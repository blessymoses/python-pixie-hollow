.. py:method:: TranscribeService.Client.list_language_models(**kwargs)

  

  Provides a list of custom language models that match the specified criteria. If no criteria are specified, all custom language models are returned.

   

  To get detailed information about a specific custom language model, use the operation.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_language_models(
        StatusEquals='IN_PROGRESS'|'FAILED'|'COMPLETED',
        NameContains='string',
        NextToken='string',
        MaxResults=123
    )
    
  :type StatusEquals: string
  :param StatusEquals: 

    Returns only custom language models with the specified status. Language models are ordered by creation date, with the newest model first. If you do not include ``StatusEquals``, all custom language models are returned.

    

  
  :type NameContains: string
  :param NameContains: 

    Returns only the custom language models that contain the specified string. The search is not case sensitive.

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    If your ``ListLanguageModels`` request returns more results than can be displayed, ``NextToken`` is displayed in the response with an associated string. To get the next page of results, copy this string and repeat your request, including ``NextToken`` with the value of the copied string. Repeat as needed to view all your results.

    

  
  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    The maximum number of custom language models to return in each page of results. If there are fewer results than the value that you specify, only the actual results are returned. If you do not specify a value, a default of 5 is used.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

        If ``NextToken`` is present in your response, it indicates that not all results are displayed. To view the next set of results, copy the string associated with the ``NextToken`` parameter in your results output, then run your request again including ``NextToken`` with the value of the copied string. Repeat as needed to view all your results.

        
      

      - **Models** *(list) --* 

        Provides information about the custom language models that match the criteria specified in your request.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          Provides information about a custom language model, including:

           

          
          * The base model name
           
          * When the model was created
           
          * The location of the files used to train the model
           
          * When the model was last modified
           
          * The name you chose for the model
           
          * The model's language
           
          * The model's processing state
           
          * Any available upgrades for the base model
          

          
          

          - **ModelName** *(string) --* 

            A unique name, chosen by you, for your custom language model.

             

            This name is case sensitive, cannot contain spaces, and must be unique within an Amazon Web Services account.

            
          

          - **CreateTime** *(datetime) --* 

            The date and time the specified custom language model was created.

             

            Timestamps are in the format ``YYYY-MM-DD'T'HH:MM:SS.SSSSSS-UTC``. For example, ``2022-05-04T12:32:58.761000-07:00`` represents 12:32 PM UTC-7 on May 4, 2022.

            
          

          - **LastModifiedTime** *(datetime) --* 

            The date and time the specified custom language model was last modified.

             

            Timestamps are in the format ``YYYY-MM-DD'T'HH:MM:SS.SSSSSS-UTC``. For example, ``2022-05-04T12:32:58.761000-07:00`` represents 12:32 PM UTC-7 on May 4, 2022.

            
          

          - **LanguageCode** *(string) --* 

            The language code used to create your custom language model. Each custom language model must contain terms in only one language, and the language you select for your custom language model must match the language of your training and tuning data.

             

            For a list of supported languages and their associated language codes, refer to the `Supported languages <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/supported-languages.html>`__ table. Note that US English ( ``en-US``) is the only language supported with Amazon Transcribe Medical.

            
          

          - **BaseModelName** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Transcribe standard language model, or base model, used to create your custom language model.

            
          

          - **ModelStatus** *(string) --* 

            The status of the specified custom language model. When the status displays as ``COMPLETED`` the model is ready for use.

            
          

          - **UpgradeAvailability** *(boolean) --* 

            Shows if a more current base model is available for use with the specified custom language model.

             

            If ``false``, your custom language model is using the most up-to-date base model.

             

            If ``true``, there is a newer base model available than the one your language model is using.

             

            Note that to update a base model, you must recreate the custom language model using the new base model. Base model upgrades for existing custom language models are not supported.

            
          

          - **FailureReason** *(string) --* 

            If ``ModelStatus`` is ``FAILED``, ``FailureReason`` contains information about why the custom language model request failed. See also: `Common Errors <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/APIReference/CommonErrors.html>`__.

            
          

          - **InputDataConfig** *(dict) --* 

            The Amazon S3 location of the input files used to train and tune your custom language model, in addition to the data access role ARN (Amazon Resource Name) that has permissions to access these data.

            
            

            - **S3Uri** *(string) --* 

              The Amazon S3 location (URI) of the text files you want to use to train your custom language model.

               

              Here's an example URI path: ``s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/my-model-training-data/``

              
            

            - **TuningDataS3Uri** *(string) --* 

              The Amazon S3 location (URI) of the text files you want to use to tune your custom language model.

               

              Here's an example URI path: ``s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/my-model-tuning-data/``

              
            

            - **DataAccessRoleArn** *(string) --* 

              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role that has permissions to access the Amazon S3 bucket that contains your input files. If the role that you specify doesn’t have the appropriate permissions to access the specified Amazon S3 location, your request fails.

               

              IAM role ARNs have the format ``arn:partition:iam::account:role/role-name-with-path``. For example: ``arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/Admin``.

               

              For more information, see `IAM ARNs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_identifiers.html#identifiers-arns>`__.
