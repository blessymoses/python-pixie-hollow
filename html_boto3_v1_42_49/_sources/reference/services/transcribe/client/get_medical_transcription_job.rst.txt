            .. warning::

               

              ``RedactedMediaFileUri`` produces a redacted audio file in addition to a redacted transcript. It is only supported for Call Analytics ( ``StartCallAnalyticsJob``) transcription requests.

        - **CreationTime** *(datetime) --*

        - **FailureReason** *(string) --* 

          If ``TranscriptionJobStatus`` is ``FAILED``, ``FailureReason`` contains information about why the transcription job request failed.

           

          The ``FailureReason`` field contains one of the following values:

           

          
          * ``Unsupported media format``. The media format specified in ``MediaFormat`` isn't valid. Refer to refer to the ``MediaFormat`` parameter for a list of supported formats.
           
          * ``The media format provided does not match the detected media format``. The media format specified in ``MediaFormat`` doesn't match the format of the input file. Check the media format of your media file and correct the specified value.
           
          * ``Invalid sample rate for audio file``. The sample rate specified in ``MediaSampleRateHertz`` isn't valid. The sample rate must be between 16,000 and 48,000 hertz.
           
          * ``The sample rate provided does not match the detected sample rate``. The sample rate specified in ``MediaSampleRateHertz`` doesn't match the sample rate detected in your input media file. Check the sample rate of your media file and correct the specified value.
           
          * ``Invalid file size: file size too large``. The size of your media file is larger than what Amazon Transcribe can process. For more information, refer to `Service quotas <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/transcribe.html#limits-amazon-transcribe>`__.
           
          * ``Invalid number of channels: number of channels too large``. Your audio contains more channels than Amazon Transcribe is able to process. For more information, refer to `Service quotas <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/transcribe.html#limits-amazon-transcribe>`__.
          

          
        

        - **Settings** *(dict) --* 

          Provides information on any additional settings that were included in your request. Additional settings include channel identification, alternative transcriptions, speaker partitioning, custom vocabularies, and custom vocabulary filters.

          
          

          - **ShowSpeakerLabels** *(boolean) --* 

            Enables speaker partitioning (diarization) in your transcription output. Speaker partitioning labels the speech from individual speakers in your media file.

             

            If you enable ``ShowSpeakerLabels`` in your request, you must also include ``MaxSpeakerLabels``.

             

            For more information, see `Partitioning speakers (diarization) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/diarization.html>`__.

            
          

          - **MaxSpeakerLabels** *(integer) --* 

            Specify the maximum number of speakers you want to partition in your media.

             

            Note that if your media contains more speakers than the specified number, multiple speakers are treated as a single speaker.

             

            If you specify the ``MaxSpeakerLabels`` field, you must set the ``ShowSpeakerLabels`` field to true.

            
          

          - **ChannelIdentification** *(boolean) --* 

            Enables channel identification in multi-channel audio.

             

            Channel identification transcribes the audio on each channel independently, then appends the output for each channel into one transcript.

             

            If you have multi-channel audio and do not enable channel identification, your audio is transcribed in a continuous manner and your transcript does not separate the speech by channel.

             

            For more information, see `Transcribing multi-channel audio <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/channel-id.html>`__.

            
          

          - **ShowAlternatives** *(boolean) --* 

            To include alternative transcriptions within your transcription output, include ``ShowAlternatives`` in your transcription request.

             

            If you include ``ShowAlternatives``, you must also include ``MaxAlternatives``, which is the maximum number of alternative transcriptions you want Amazon Transcribe Medical to generate.

             

            For more information, see `Alternative transcriptions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/how-alternatives.html>`__.

            
          

          - **MaxAlternatives** *(integer) --* 

            Indicate the maximum number of alternative transcriptions you want Amazon Transcribe Medical to include in your transcript.

             

            If you select a number greater than the number of alternative transcriptions generated by Amazon Transcribe Medical, only the actual number of alternative transcriptions are included.

             

            If you include ``MaxAlternatives`` in your request, you must also include ``ShowAlternatives`` with a value of ``true``.

             

            For more information, see `Alternative transcriptions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/how-alternatives.html>`__.

            
          

          - **VocabularyName** *(string) --* 

            The name of the custom vocabulary you want to use when processing your medical transcription job. Custom vocabulary names are case sensitive.

             

            The language of the specified custom vocabulary must match the language code that you specify in your transcription request. If the languages do not match, the custom vocabulary isn't applied. There are no errors or warnings associated with a language mismatch. US English ( ``en-US``) is the only valid language for Amazon Transcribe Medical.

            
      
        

        - **ContentIdentificationType** *(string) --* 

          Indicates whether content identification was enabled for your transcription request.

          
        

        - **Specialty** *(string) --* 

          Describes the medical specialty represented in your media.

          
        

        - **Type** *(string) --* 

          Indicates whether the input media is a dictation or a conversation, as specified in the ``StartMedicalTranscriptionJob`` request.

          
        

        - **Tags** *(list) --* 

          The tags, each in the form of a key:value pair, assigned to the specified medical transcription job.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            Adds metadata, in the form of a key:value pair, to the specified resource.

             

            For example, you could add the tag ``Department:Sales`` to a resource to indicate that it pertains to your organization's sales department. You can also use tags for tag-based access control.

             

            To learn more about tagging, see `Tagging resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/tagging.html>`__.

            
            

            - **Key** *(string) --* 

              The first part of a key:value pair that forms a tag associated with a given resource. For example, in the tag ``Department:Sales``, the key is 'Department'.

              
            

            - **Value** *(string) --* 

              The second part of a key:value pair that forms a tag associated with a given resource. For example, in the tag ``Department:Sales``, the value is 'Sales'.

               

              Note that you can set the value of a tag to an empty string, but you can't set the value of a tag to null. Omitting the tag value is the same as using an empty string.
