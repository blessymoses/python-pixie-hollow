.. py:method:: TranscribeService.Client.start_call_analytics_job(**kwargs)

  

  Transcribes the audio from a customer service call and applies any additional Request Parameters you choose to include in your request.

   

  In addition to many standard transcription features, Call Analytics provides you with call characteristics, call summarization, speaker sentiment, and optional redaction of your text transcript and your audio file. You can also apply custom categories to flag specified conditions. To learn more about these features and insights, refer to `Analyzing call center audio with Call Analytics <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/call-analytics.html>`__.

   

  If you want to apply categories to your Call Analytics job, you must create them before submitting your job request. Categories cannot be retroactively applied to a job. To create a new category, use the operation. To learn more about Call Analytics categories, see `Creating categories for post-call transcriptions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/tca-categories-batch.html>`__ and `Creating categories for real-time transcriptions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/tca-categories-stream.html>`__.

   

  To make a ``StartCallAnalyticsJob`` request, you must first upload your media file into an Amazon S3 bucket; you can then specify the Amazon S3 location of the file using the ``Media`` parameter.

   

  Job queuing is available for Call Analytics jobs. If you pass a ``DataAccessRoleArn`` in your request and you exceed your Concurrent Job Limit, your job will automatically be added to a queue to be processed once your concurrent job count is below the limit.

   

  You must include the following parameters in your ``StartCallAnalyticsJob`` request:

   

  
  * ``region``: The Amazon Web Services Region where you are making your request. For a list of Amazon Web Services Regions supported with Amazon Transcribe, refer to `Amazon Transcribe endpoints and quotas <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/transcribe.html>`__.
   
  * ``CallAnalyticsJobName``: A custom name that you create for your transcription job that's unique within your Amazon Web Services account.
   
  * ``Media`` ( ``MediaFileUri`` or ``RedactedMediaFileUri``): The Amazon S3 location of your media file.
  

   

  .. note::

    

    With Call Analytics, you can redact the audio contained in your media file by including ``RedactedMediaFileUri``, instead of ``MediaFileUri``, to specify the location of your input audio. If you choose to redact your audio, you can find your redacted media at the location specified in the ``RedactedMediaFileUri`` field of your response.

  :type CallAnalyticsJobName: string
  :param CallAnalyticsJobName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A unique name, chosen by you, for your Call Analytics job.

     

    This name is case sensitive, cannot contain spaces, and must be unique within an Amazon Web Services account. If you try to create a new job with the same name as an existing job, you get a ``ConflictException`` error.

    

  
  :type Media: dict
  :param Media: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Describes the Amazon S3 location of the media file you want to use in your Call Analytics request.

    

  
    - **MediaFileUri** *(string) --* 

      The Amazon S3 location of the media file you want to transcribe. For example:

       

      
      * ``s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/my-media-file.flac``
       
      * ``s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/media-files/my-media-file.flac``
      

       

      Note that the Amazon S3 bucket that contains your input media must be located in the same Amazon Web Services Region where you're making your transcription request.

      

    
    - **RedactedMediaFileUri** *(string) --* 

      The Amazon S3 location of the media file you want to redact. For example:

       

      
      * ``s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/my-media-file.flac``
       
      * ``s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/media-files/my-media-file.flac``
      

       

      Note that the Amazon S3 bucket that contains your input media must be located in the same Amazon Web Services Region where you're making your transcription request.

       

      .. warning::

         

        ``RedactedMediaFileUri`` produces a redacted audio file in addition to a redacted transcript. It is only supported for Call Analytics ( ``StartCallAnalyticsJob``) transcription requests.

        

      

    
  
  :type OutputLocation: string
  :param OutputLocation: 

    The Amazon S3 location where you want your Call Analytics transcription output stored. You can use any of the following formats to specify the output location:

     

     
    * s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET
     
    * s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/my-output-folder/
     
    * s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/my-output-folder/my-call-analytics-job.json
     

     

    Unless you specify a file name (option 3), the name of your output file has a default value that matches the name you specified for your transcription job using the ``CallAnalyticsJobName`` parameter.

     

    You can specify a KMS key to encrypt your output using the ``OutputEncryptionKMSKeyId`` parameter. If you do not specify a KMS key, Amazon Transcribe uses the default Amazon S3 key for server-side encryption.

     

    If you do not specify ``OutputLocation``, your transcript is placed in a service-managed Amazon S3 bucket and you are provided with a URI to access your transcript.

    

  
  :type OutputEncryptionKMSKeyId: string
  :param OutputEncryptionKMSKeyId: 

    The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a KMS key that you want to use to encrypt your Call Analytics output.

     

    KMS key ARNs have the format ``arn:partition:kms:region:account:key/key-id``. For example: ``arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab``. For more information, see `KMS key ARNs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-id-key-ARN>`__.

     

    If you do not specify an encryption key, your output is encrypted with the default Amazon S3 key (SSE-S3).

     

    Note that the role making the request and the role specified in the ``DataAccessRoleArn`` request parameter (if present) must have permission to use the specified KMS key.

    

  
  :type DataAccessRoleArn: string
  :param DataAccessRoleArn: 

    The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role that has permissions to access the Amazon S3 bucket that contains your input files. If the role that you specify doesn’t have the appropriate permissions to access the specified Amazon S3 location, your request fails.

     

    IAM role ARNs have the format ``arn:partition:iam::account:role/role-name-with-path``. For example: ``arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/Admin``.

     

    For more information, see `IAM ARNs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_identifiers.html#identifiers-arns>`__.

    

  
  :type Settings: dict
  :param Settings: 

    Specify additional optional settings in your request, including content redaction; allows you to apply custom language models, vocabulary filters, and custom vocabularies to your Call Analytics job.

    

  
    - **VocabularyName** *(string) --* 

      The name of the custom vocabulary you want to include in your Call Analytics transcription request. Custom vocabulary names are case sensitive.

      

    
    - **VocabularyFilterName** *(string) --* 

      The name of the custom vocabulary filter you want to include in your Call Analytics transcription request. Custom vocabulary filter names are case sensitive.

       

      Note that if you include ``VocabularyFilterName`` in your request, you must also include ``VocabularyFilterMethod``.

      

    
    - **VocabularyFilterMethod** *(string) --* 

      Specify how you want your custom vocabulary filter applied to your transcript.

       

      To replace words with ``***``, choose ``mask``.

       

      To delete words, choose ``remove``.

       

      To flag words without changing them, choose ``tag``.

      

    
    - **LanguageModelName** *(string) --* 

      The name of the custom language model you want to use when processing your Call Analytics job. Note that custom language model names are case sensitive.

       

      The language of the specified custom language model must match the language code that you specify in your transcription request. If the languages do not match, the custom language model isn't applied. There are no errors or warnings associated with a language mismatch.

      

    
    - **ContentRedaction** *(dict) --* 

      Makes it possible to redact or flag specified personally identifiable information (PII) in your transcript. If you use ``ContentRedaction``, you must also include the sub-parameters: ``RedactionOutput`` and ``RedactionType``. You can optionally include ``PiiEntityTypes`` to choose which types of PII you want to redact.

      

    
      - **RedactionType** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        Specify the category of information you want to redact; ``PII`` (personally identifiable information) is the only valid value. You can use ``PiiEntityTypes`` to choose which types of PII you want to redact. If you do not include ``PiiEntityTypes`` in your request, all PII is redacted.

        

      
      - **RedactionOutput** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        Specify if you want only a redacted transcript, or if you want a redacted and an unredacted transcript.

         

        When you choose ``redacted`` Amazon Transcribe creates only a redacted transcript.

         

        When you choose ``redacted_and_unredacted`` Amazon Transcribe creates a redacted and an unredacted transcript (as two separate files).

        

      
      - **PiiEntityTypes** *(list) --* 

        Specify which types of personally identifiable information (PII) you want to redact in your transcript. You can include as many types as you'd like, or you can select ``ALL``. If you do not include ``PiiEntityTypes`` in your request, all PII is redacted.

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
    
    
    - **LanguageOptions** *(list) --* 

      You can specify two or more language codes that represent the languages you think may be present in your media. Including more than five is not recommended. If you're unsure what languages are present, do not include this parameter.

       

      Including language options can improve the accuracy of language identification.

       

      For a list of languages supported with Call Analytics, refer to the `Supported languages <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/supported-languages.html>`__ table.

       

      To transcribe speech in Modern Standard Arabic ( ``ar-SA``) in Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) (US-West, us-gov-west-1), Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) (US-East, us-gov-east-1), Canada (Calgary) ca-west-1 and Africa (Cape Town) af-south-1, your media file must be encoded at a sample rate of 16,000 Hz or higher.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    - **LanguageIdSettings** *(dict) --* 

      If using automatic language identification in your request and you want to apply a custom language model, a custom vocabulary, or a custom vocabulary filter, include ``LanguageIdSettings`` with the relevant sub-parameters ( ``VocabularyName``, ``LanguageModelName``, and ``VocabularyFilterName``).

       

      ``LanguageIdSettings`` supports two to five language codes. Each language code you include can have an associated custom language model, custom vocabulary, and custom vocabulary filter. The language codes that you specify must match the languages of the associated custom language models, custom vocabularies, and custom vocabulary filters.

       

      It's recommended that you include ``LanguageOptions`` when using ``LanguageIdSettings`` to ensure that the correct language dialect is identified. For example, if you specify a custom vocabulary that is in ``en-US`` but Amazon Transcribe determines that the language spoken in your media is ``en-AU``, your custom vocabulary *is not* applied to your transcription. If you include ``LanguageOptions`` and include ``en-US`` as the only English language dialect, your custom vocabulary *is* applied to your transcription.

       

      If you want to include a custom language model, custom vocabulary, or custom vocabulary filter with your request but **do not** want to use automatic language identification, use instead the  parameter with the ``LanguageModelName``, ``VocabularyName``, or ``VocabularyFilterName`` sub-parameters.

       

      For a list of languages supported with Call Analytics, refer to `Supported languages and language-specific features <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/supported-languages.html>`__.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
        - *(dict) --* 

          If using automatic language identification in your request and you want to apply a custom language model, a custom vocabulary, or a custom vocabulary filter, include ``LanguageIdSettings`` with the relevant sub-parameters ( ``VocabularyName``, ``LanguageModelName``, and ``VocabularyFilterName``). Note that multi-language identification ( ``IdentifyMultipleLanguages``) doesn't support custom language models.

           

          ``LanguageIdSettings`` supports two to five language codes. Each language code you include can have an associated custom language model, custom vocabulary, and custom vocabulary filter. The language codes that you specify must match the languages of the associated custom language models, custom vocabularies, and custom vocabulary filters.

           

          It's recommended that you include ``LanguageOptions`` when using ``LanguageIdSettings`` to ensure that the correct language dialect is identified. For example, if you specify a custom vocabulary that is in ``en-US`` but Amazon Transcribe determines that the language spoken in your media is ``en-AU``, your custom vocabulary *is not* applied to your transcription. If you include ``LanguageOptions`` and include ``en-US`` as the only English language dialect, your custom vocabulary *is* applied to your transcription.

           

          If you want to include a custom language model with your request but **do not** want to use automatic language identification, use instead the  parameter with the ``LanguageModelName`` sub-parameter. If you want to include a custom vocabulary or a custom vocabulary filter (or both) with your request but **do not** want to use automatic language identification, use instead the  parameter with the ``VocabularyName`` or ``VocabularyFilterName`` (or both) sub-parameter.

          

        
          - **VocabularyName** *(string) --* 

            The name of the custom vocabulary you want to use when processing your transcription job. Custom vocabulary names are case sensitive.

             

            The language of the specified custom vocabulary must match the language code that you specify in your transcription request. If the languages do not match, the custom vocabulary isn't applied. There are no errors or warnings associated with a language mismatch.

            

          
          - **VocabularyFilterName** *(string) --* 

            The name of the custom vocabulary filter you want to use when processing your transcription job. Custom vocabulary filter names are case sensitive.

             

            The language of the specified custom vocabulary filter must match the language code that you specify in your transcription request. If the languages do not match, the custom vocabulary filter isn't applied. There are no errors or warnings associated with a language mismatch.

             

            Note that if you include ``VocabularyFilterName`` in your request, you must also include ``VocabularyFilterMethod``.

            

          
          - **LanguageModelName** *(string) --* 

            The name of the custom language model you want to use when processing your transcription job. Note that custom language model names are case sensitive.

             

            The language of the specified custom language model must match the language code that you specify in your transcription request. If the languages do not match, the custom language model isn't applied. There are no errors or warnings associated with a language mismatch.

            

          
        
  

    - **Summarization** *(dict) --* 

      Contains ``GenerateAbstractiveSummary``, which is a required parameter if you want to enable Generative call summarization in your Call Analytics request.

      

    
      - **GenerateAbstractiveSummary** *(boolean) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        Enables Generative call summarization in your Call Analytics request

         

        Generative call summarization provides a summary of the transcript including important components discussed in the conversation.

         

        For more information, see `Enabling generative call summarization <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/tca-enable-summarization.html>`__.

        

      
    
  
  :type Tags: list
  :param Tags: 

    Adds one or more custom tags, each in the form of a key:value pair, to a new call analytics job at the time you start this new job.

     

    To learn more about using tags with Amazon Transcribe, refer to `Tagging resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/tagging.html>`__.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      Adds metadata, in the form of a key:value pair, to the specified resource.

       

      For example, you could add the tag ``Department:Sales`` to a resource to indicate that it pertains to your organization's sales department. You can also use tags for tag-based access control.

       

      To learn more about tagging, see `Tagging resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/tagging.html>`__.

      

    
      - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The first part of a key:value pair that forms a tag associated with a given resource. For example, in the tag ``Department:Sales``, the key is 'Department'.

        

      
      - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The second part of a key:value pair that forms a tag associated with a given resource. For example, in the tag ``Department:Sales``, the value is 'Sales'.

         

        Note that you can set the value of a tag to an empty string, but you can't set the value of a tag to null. Omitting the tag value is the same as using an empty string.

        

      
    

  :type ChannelDefinitions: list
  :param ChannelDefinitions: 

    Makes it possible to specify which speaker is on which channel. For example, if your agent is the first participant to speak, you would set ``ChannelId`` to ``0`` (to indicate the first channel) and ``ParticipantRole`` to ``AGENT`` (to indicate that it's the agent speaking).

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      Makes it possible to specify which speaker is on which channel. For example, if your agent is the first participant to speak, you would set ``ChannelId`` to ``0`` (to indicate the first channel) and ``ParticipantRole`` to ``AGENT`` (to indicate that it's the agent speaking).

      

    
      - **ChannelId** *(integer) --* 

        Specify the audio channel you want to define.

        

      
      - **ParticipantRole** *(string) --* 

        Specify the speaker you want to define. Omitting this parameter is equivalent to specifying both participants.

              ``RedactedMediaFileUri`` produces a redacted audio file in addition to a redacted transcript. It is only supported for Call Analytics ( ``StartCallAnalyticsJob``) transcription requests.

              

            
      
        

        - **Transcript** *(dict) --* 

          Provides you with the Amazon S3 URI you can use to access your transcript.

          
          

          - **TranscriptFileUri** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon S3 location of your transcript. You can use this URI to access or download your transcript.

             

            If you included ``OutputBucketName`` in your transcription job request, this is the URI of that bucket. If you also included ``OutputKey`` in your request, your output is located in the path you specified in your request.

             

            If you didn't include ``OutputBucketName`` in your transcription job request, your transcript is stored in a service-managed bucket, and ``TranscriptFileUri`` provides you with a temporary URI you can use for secure access to your transcript.

             

            .. note::

              

              Temporary URIs for service-managed Amazon S3 buckets are only valid for 15 minutes. If you get an ``AccesDenied`` error, you can get a new temporary URI by running a ``GetTranscriptionJob`` or ``ListTranscriptionJob`` request.

              

            
          

          - **RedactedTranscriptFileUri** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon S3 location of your redacted transcript. You can use this URI to access or download your transcript.

             

            If you included ``OutputBucketName`` in your transcription job request, this is the URI of that bucket. If you also included ``OutputKey`` in your request, your output is located in the path you specified in your request.

             

            If you didn't include ``OutputBucketName`` in your transcription job request, your transcript is stored in a service-managed bucket, and ``RedactedTranscriptFileUri`` provides you with a temporary URI you can use for secure access to your transcript.

             

            .. note::

              

              Temporary URIs for service-managed Amazon S3 buckets are only valid for 15 minutes. If you get an ``AccesDenied`` error, you can get a new temporary URI by running a ``GetTranscriptionJob`` or ``ListTranscriptionJob`` request.

            To delete words, choose ``remove``.

             

            To flag words without changing them, choose ``tag``.

            
          

          - **LanguageModelName** *(string) --* 

            The name of the custom language model you want to use when processing your Call Analytics job. Note that custom language model names are case sensitive.

             

            The language of the specified custom language model must match the language code that you specify in your transcription request. If the languages do not match, the custom language model isn't applied. There are no errors or warnings associated with a language mismatch.

            
          

          - **ContentRedaction** *(dict) --* 

            Makes it possible to redact or flag specified personally identifiable information (PII) in your transcript. If you use ``ContentRedaction``, you must also include the sub-parameters: ``RedactionOutput`` and ``RedactionType``. You can optionally include ``PiiEntityTypes`` to choose which types of PII you want to redact.

            
            

            - **RedactionType** *(string) --* 

              Specify the category of information you want to redact; ``PII`` (personally identifiable information) is the only valid value. You can use ``PiiEntityTypes`` to choose which types of PII you want to redact. If you do not include ``PiiEntityTypes`` in your request, all PII is redacted.

              
            

            - **RedactionOutput** *(string) --* 

              Specify if you want only a redacted transcript, or if you want a redacted and an unredacted transcript.

          - **LanguageOptions** *(list) --* 

            You can specify two or more language codes that represent the languages you think may be present in your media. Including more than five is not recommended. If you're unsure what languages are present, do not include this parameter.

             

            Including language options can improve the accuracy of language identification.

            To transcribe speech in Modern Standard Arabic ( ``ar-SA``) in Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) (US-West, us-gov-west-1), Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) (US-East, us-gov-east-1), Canada (Calgary) ca-west-1 and Africa (Cape Town) af-south-1, your media file must be encoded at a sample rate of 16,000 Hz or higher.

            
            

            - *(string) --* 
        
          

          - **LanguageIdSettings** *(dict) --* 

            If using automatic language identification in your request and you want to apply a custom language model, a custom vocabulary, or a custom vocabulary filter, include ``LanguageIdSettings`` with the relevant sub-parameters ( ``VocabularyName``, ``LanguageModelName``, and ``VocabularyFilterName``).

             

            ``LanguageIdSettings`` supports two to five language codes. Each language code you include can have an associated custom language model, custom vocabulary, and custom vocabulary filter. The language codes that you specify must match the languages of the associated custom language models, custom vocabularies, and custom vocabulary filters.

             

            It's recommended that you include ``LanguageOptions`` when using ``LanguageIdSettings`` to ensure that the correct language dialect is identified. For example, if you specify a custom vocabulary that is in ``en-US`` but Amazon Transcribe determines that the language spoken in your media is ``en-AU``, your custom vocabulary *is not* applied to your transcription. If you include ``LanguageOptions`` and include ``en-US`` as the only English language dialect, your custom vocabulary *is* applied to your transcription.

             

            If you want to include a custom language model, custom vocabulary, or custom vocabulary filter with your request but **do not** want to use automatic language identification, use instead the  parameter with the ``LanguageModelName``, ``VocabularyName``, or ``VocabularyFilterName`` sub-parameters.

            - *(string) --* 
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                If using automatic language identification in your request and you want to apply a custom language model, a custom vocabulary, or a custom vocabulary filter, include ``LanguageIdSettings`` with the relevant sub-parameters ( ``VocabularyName``, ``LanguageModelName``, and ``VocabularyFilterName``). Note that multi-language identification ( ``IdentifyMultipleLanguages``) doesn't support custom language models.

                 

                ``LanguageIdSettings`` supports two to five language codes. Each language code you include can have an associated custom language model, custom vocabulary, and custom vocabulary filter. The language codes that you specify must match the languages of the associated custom language models, custom vocabularies, and custom vocabulary filters.

                 

                It's recommended that you include ``LanguageOptions`` when using ``LanguageIdSettings`` to ensure that the correct language dialect is identified.

                If you want to include a custom language model with your request but **do not** want to use automatic language identification, use instead the  parameter with the ``LanguageModelName`` sub-parameter. If you want to include a custom vocabulary or a custom vocabulary filter (or both) with your request but **do not** want to use automatic language identification, use instead the  parameter with the ``VocabularyName`` or ``VocabularyFilterName`` (or both) sub-parameter.

                
                

                - **VocabularyName** *(string) --* 

                  The name of the custom vocabulary you want to use when processing your transcription job. Custom vocabulary names are case sensitive.

                   

                  The language of the specified custom vocabulary must match the language code that you specify in your transcription request. If the languages do not match, the custom vocabulary isn't applied. There are no errors or warnings associated with a language mismatch.

                  
                

                - **VocabularyFilterName** *(string) --* 

                  The name of the custom vocabulary filter you want to use when processing your transcription job. Custom vocabulary filter names are case sensitive.

                   

                  The language of the specified custom vocabulary filter must match the language code that you specify in your transcription request. If the languages do not match, the custom vocabulary filter isn't applied. There are no errors or warnings associated with a language mismatch.

                   

                  Note that if you include ``VocabularyFilterName`` in your request, you must also include ``VocabularyFilterMethod``.

                  
                

                - **LanguageModelName** *(string) --* 

                  The name of the custom language model you want to use when processing your transcription job. Note that custom language model names are case sensitive.

                   

                  The language of the specified custom language model must match the language code that you specify in your transcription request. If the languages do not match, the custom language model isn't applied. There are no errors or warnings associated with a language mismatch.

                  
            
        
      
          

          - **Summarization** *(dict) --* 

            Contains ``GenerateAbstractiveSummary``, which is a required parameter if you want to enable Generative call summarization in your Call Analytics request.

            
            

            - **GenerateAbstractiveSummary** *(boolean) --* 

              Enables Generative call summarization in your Call Analytics request

               

              Generative call summarization provides a summary of the transcript including important components discussed in the conversation.

               

              For more information, see `Enabling generative call summarization <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/tca-enable-summarization.html>`__.

              
        
      
        

        - **ChannelDefinitions** *(list) --* 

          Indicates which speaker is on which channel.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            Makes it possible to specify which speaker is on which channel. For example, if your agent is the first participant to speak, you would set ``ChannelId`` to ``0`` (to indicate the first channel) and ``ParticipantRole`` to ``AGENT`` (to indicate that it's the agent speaking).

            
            

            - **ChannelId** *(integer) --* 

              Specify the audio channel you want to define.

              
            

            - **ParticipantRole** *(string) --* 

              Specify the speaker you want to define. Omitting this parameter is equivalent to specifying both participants.

              
        
      
        

        - **Tags** *(list) --* 

          The tags, each in the form of a key:value pair, assigned to the specified call analytics job.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            Adds metadata, in the form of a key:value pair, to the specified resource.

             

            For example, you could add the tag ``Department:Sales`` to a resource to indicate that it pertains to your organization's sales department. You can also use tags for tag-based access control.

             

            To learn more about tagging, see `Tagging resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/tagging.html>`__.

            
            

            - **Key** *(string) --* 

              The first part of a key:value pair that forms a tag associated with a given resource. For example, in the tag ``Department:Sales``, the key is 'Department'.

              
            

            - **Value** *(string) --* 

              The second part of a key:value pair that forms a tag associated with a given resource. For example, in the tag ``Department:Sales``, the value is 'Sales'.

               

              Note that you can set the value of a tag to an empty string, but you can't set the value of a tag to null. Omitting the tag value is the same as using an empty string.
