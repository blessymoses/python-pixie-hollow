.. py:method:: AutoScaling.Client.create_launch_configuration(**kwargs)

  

  Creates a launch configuration.

   

  If you exceed your maximum limit of launch configurations, the call fails. To query this limit, call the `DescribeAccountLimits <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_DescribeAccountLimits.html>`__ API. For information about updating this limit, see `Quotas for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-quotas.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.

   

  For more information, see `Launch configurations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/launch-configurations.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.

   

  .. note::

    

    Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling configures instances launched as part of an Auto Scaling group using either a launch template or a launch configuration. We strongly recommend that you do not use launch configurations. They do not provide full functionality for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling or Amazon EC2. For information about using launch templates, see `Launch templates <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/launch-templates.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.

  :type InstanceId: string
  :param InstanceId: 

    The ID of the instance to use to create the launch configuration. The new launch configuration derives attributes from the instance, except for the block device mapping.

     

    To create a launch configuration with a block device mapping or override any other instance attributes, specify them as part of the same request.

     

    For more information, see `Create a launch configuration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/create-launch-config.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.

    

  
  :type InstanceType: string
  :param InstanceType: 

    Specifies the instance type of the EC2 instance. For information about available instance types, see `Available instance types <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html#AvailableInstanceTypes>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

     

    If you specify ``InstanceId``, an ``InstanceType`` is not required.

    

  
  :type KernelId: string
  :param KernelId: 

    The ID of the kernel associated with the AMI.

     

    .. note::

      

      We recommend that you use PV-GRUB instead of kernels and RAM disks. For more information, see `User provided kernels <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/UserProvidedKernels.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

      

    

  
  :type RamdiskId: string
  :param RamdiskId: 

    The ID of the RAM disk to select.

     

    .. note::

      

      We recommend that you use PV-GRUB instead of kernels and RAM disks. For more information, see `User provided kernels <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/UserProvidedKernels.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

      

    

  
  :type BlockDeviceMappings: list
  :param BlockDeviceMappings: 

    The block device mapping entries that define the block devices to attach to the instances at launch. By default, the block devices specified in the block device mapping for the AMI are used. For more information, see `Block device mappings <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/block-device-mapping-concepts.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      Describes a block device mapping.

      

    
      - **VirtualName** *(string) --* 

        The name of the instance store volume (virtual device) to attach to an instance at launch. The name must be in the form ephemeral*X* where *X* is a number starting from zero (0), for example, ``ephemeral0``.

        

      
      - **DeviceName** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The device name assigned to the volume (for example, ``/dev/sdh`` or ``xvdh``). For more information, see `Device naming on Linux instances <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/device_naming.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

         

        .. note::

          

          To define a block device mapping, set the device name and exactly one of the following properties: ``Ebs``, ``NoDevice``, or ``VirtualName``.

          

        

      
      - **Ebs** *(dict) --* 

        Information to attach an EBS volume to an instance at launch.

        

      
        - **SnapshotId** *(string) --* 

          The snapshot ID of the volume to use.

           

          You must specify either a ``VolumeSize`` or a ``SnapshotId``.

          

        
        - **VolumeSize** *(integer) --* 

          The volume size, in GiBs. The following are the supported volumes sizes for each volume type:

           

          
          * ``gp2`` and ``gp3``: 1-16,384
           
          * ``io1``: 4-16,384
           
          * ``st1`` and ``sc1``: 125-16,384
           
          * ``standard``: 1-1,024
          

           

          You must specify either a ``SnapshotId`` or a ``VolumeSize``. If you specify both ``SnapshotId`` and ``VolumeSize``, the volume size must be equal or greater than the size of the snapshot.

          

        
        - **VolumeType** *(string) --* 

          The volume type. For more information, see `Amazon EBS volume types <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-volume-types.html>`__ in the *Amazon EBS User Guide*.

           

          Valid values: ``standard`` | ``io1`` | ``gp2`` | ``st1`` | ``sc1`` | ``gp3``

          

        
        - **DeleteOnTermination** *(boolean) --* 

          Indicates whether the volume is deleted on instance termination. For Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, the default value is ``true``.

          

        
        - **Iops** *(integer) --* 

          The number of input/output (I/O) operations per second (IOPS) to provision for the volume. For ``gp3`` and ``io1`` volumes, this represents the number of IOPS that are provisioned for the volume. For ``gp2`` volumes, this represents the baseline performance of the volume and the rate at which the volume accumulates I/O credits for bursting.

           

          The following are the supported values for each volume type:

           

          
          * ``gp3``: 3,000-16,000 IOPS
           
          * ``io1``: 100-64,000 IOPS
          

           

          For ``io1`` volumes, we guarantee 64,000 IOPS only for `Instances built on the Amazon Web Services Nitro System <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/instancetypes/ec2-nitro-instances.html>`__. Other instance families guarantee performance up to 32,000 IOPS.

           

          ``Iops`` is supported when the volume type is ``gp3`` or ``io1`` and required only when the volume type is ``io1``. (Not used with ``standard``, ``gp2``, ``st1``, or ``sc1`` volumes.)

          

        
        - **Encrypted** *(boolean) --* 

          Specifies whether the volume should be encrypted. Encrypted EBS volumes can only be attached to instances that support Amazon EBS encryption. For more information, see `Requirements for Amazon EBS encryption <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-encryption-requirements.html>`__ in the *Amazon EBS User Guide*. If your AMI uses encrypted volumes, you can also only launch it on supported instance types.

           

          .. note::

            

            If you are creating a volume from a snapshot, you cannot create an unencrypted volume from an encrypted snapshot. Also, you cannot specify a KMS key ID when using a launch configuration.

             

            If you enable encryption by default, the EBS volumes that you create are always encrypted, either using the Amazon Web Services managed KMS key or a customer-managed KMS key, regardless of whether the snapshot was encrypted.

             

            For more information, see `Use Amazon Web Services KMS keys to encrypt Amazon EBS volumes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-data-protection.html#encryption>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.

            

          

        
        - **Throughput** *(integer) --* 

          The throughput (MiBps) to provision for a ``gp3`` volume.

          

        
      
      - **NoDevice** *(boolean) --* 

        Setting this value to ``true`` prevents a volume that is included in the block device mapping of the AMI from being mapped to the specified device name at launch.

         

        If ``NoDevice`` is ``true`` for the root device, instances might fail the EC2 health check. In that case, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launches replacement instances.

        

      
    

  :type InstanceMonitoring: dict
  :param InstanceMonitoring: 

    Controls whether instances in this group are launched with detailed ( ``true``) or basic ( ``false``) monitoring.

     

    The default value is ``true`` (enabled).

     

    .. warning::

       

      When detailed monitoring is enabled, Amazon CloudWatch generates metrics every minute and your account is charged a fee. When you disable detailed monitoring, CloudWatch generates metrics every 5 minutes. For more information, see `Configure monitoring for Auto Scaling instances <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/latest/userguide/enable-as-instance-metrics.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.

      

    

  
    - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

      If ``true``, detailed monitoring is enabled. Otherwise, basic monitoring is enabled.

      

    
  
  :type SpotPrice: string
  :param SpotPrice: 

    The maximum hourly price to be paid for any Spot Instance launched to fulfill the request. Spot Instances are launched when the price you specify exceeds the current Spot price. For more information, see `Request Spot Instances for fault-tolerant and flexible applications <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/launch-template-spot-instances.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.

     

    Valid Range: Minimum value of 0.001

     

    .. note::

      

      When you change your maximum price by creating a new launch configuration, running instances will continue to run as long as the maximum price for those running instances is higher than the current Spot price.

      

    

  
  :type IamInstanceProfile: string
  :param IamInstanceProfile: 

    The name or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the instance profile associated with the IAM role for the instance. The instance profile contains the IAM role. For more information, see `IAM role for applications that run on Amazon EC2 instances <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/us-iam-role.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.

    

  
  :type EbsOptimized: boolean
  :param EbsOptimized: 

    Specifies whether the launch configuration is optimized for EBS I/O ( ``true``) or not ( ``false``). The optimization provides dedicated throughput to Amazon EBS and an optimized configuration stack to provide optimal I/O performance. This optimization is not available with all instance types. Additional fees are incurred when you enable EBS optimization for an instance type that is not EBS-optimized by default. For more information, see `Amazon EBS-optimized instances <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-optimized.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

     

    The default value is ``false``.

    

  
  :type AssociatePublicIpAddress: boolean
  :param AssociatePublicIpAddress: 

    Specifies whether to assign a public IPv4 address to the group's instances. If the instance is launched into a default subnet, the default is to assign a public IPv4 address, unless you disabled the option to assign a public IPv4 address on the subnet. If the instance is launched into a nondefault subnet, the default is not to assign a public IPv4 address, unless you enabled the option to assign a public IPv4 address on the subnet.

     

    If you specify ``true``, each instance in the Auto Scaling group receives a unique public IPv4 address. For more information, see `Provide network connectivity for your Auto Scaling instances using Amazon VPC <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/asg-in-vpc.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.

     

    If you specify this property, you must specify at least one subnet for ``VPCZoneIdentifier`` when you create your group.

    

  
  :type PlacementTenancy: string
  :param PlacementTenancy: 

    The tenancy of the instance, either ``default`` or ``dedicated``. An instance with ``dedicated`` tenancy runs on isolated, single-tenant hardware and can only be launched into a VPC. To launch dedicated instances into a shared tenancy VPC (a VPC with the instance placement tenancy attribute set to ``default``), you must set the value of this property to ``dedicated``.

     

    If you specify ``PlacementTenancy``, you must specify at least one subnet for ``VPCZoneIdentifier`` when you create your group.

     

    Valid values: ``default`` | ``dedicated``

    

  
  :type MetadataOptions: dict
  :param MetadataOptions: 

    The metadata options for the instances. For more information, see `Configure the instance metadata options <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/create-launch-config.html#launch-configurations-imds>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.

    

  
    - **HttpTokens** *(string) --* 

      The state of token usage for your instance metadata requests. If the parameter is not specified in the request, the default state is ``optional``.

       

      If the state is ``optional``, you can choose to retrieve instance metadata with or without a signed token header on your request. If you retrieve the IAM role credentials without a token, the version 1.0 role credentials are returned. If you retrieve the IAM role credentials using a valid signed token, the version 2.0 role credentials are returned.

       

      If the state is ``required``, you must send a signed token header with any instance metadata retrieval requests. In this state, retrieving the IAM role credentials always returns the version 2.0 credentials; the version 1.0 credentials are not available.

      

    
    - **HttpPutResponseHopLimit** *(integer) --* 

      The desired HTTP PUT response hop limit for instance metadata requests. The larger the number, the further instance metadata requests can travel.

       

      Default: 1

      

    
    - **HttpEndpoint** *(string) --* 

      This parameter enables or disables the HTTP metadata endpoint on your instances. If the parameter is not specified, the default state is ``enabled``.

       

      .. note::

        

        If you specify a value of ``disabled``, you will not be able to access your instance metadata.

        

      

    
  
  
  :returns: None
