.. py:method:: AutoScaling.Client.describe_scaling_activities(**kwargs)

  

  Gets information about the scaling activities in the account and Region.

   

  When scaling events occur, you see a record of the scaling activity in the scaling activities. For more information, see `Verify a scaling activity for an Auto Scaling group <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-verify-scaling-activity.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.

   

  If the scaling event succeeds, the value of the ``StatusCode`` element in the response is ``Successful``. If an attempt to launch instances failed, the ``StatusCode`` value is ``Failed`` or ``Cancelled`` and the ``StatusMessage`` element in the response indicates the cause of the failure. For help interpreting the ``StatusMessage``, see `Troubleshooting Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/CHAP_Troubleshooting.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.

    )
    
  :type ActivityIds: list
  :param ActivityIds: 

    The activity IDs of the desired scaling activities. If unknown activity IDs are requested, they are ignored with no error. Only activities started within the last six weeks can be returned regardless of the activity IDs specified. If other filters are specified with the request, only results matching all filter criteria can be returned.

     

    Array Members: Maximum number of 50 IDs.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type AutoScalingGroupName: string
  :param AutoScalingGroupName: 

    The name of the Auto Scaling group.

     

    .. warning::

       

      Omitting this property performs an account-wide operation, which can result in slower or timed-out requests.

      

    

  
  :type IncludeDeletedGroups: boolean
  :param IncludeDeletedGroups: 

    Indicates whether to include scaling activity from deleted Auto Scaling groups.

    

  
  :type MaxRecords: integer
  :param MaxRecords: 

    The maximum number of items to return with this call. The default value is ``100`` and the maximum value is ``100``.

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    The token for the next set of items to return. (You received this token from a previous call.)

    

  
  :type Filters: list
  :param Filters: 

    One or more filters to limit the results based on specific criteria. The following filters are supported:

     

    
    * ``StartTimeLowerBound`` - The earliest scaling activities to return based on the activity start time. Scaling activities with a start time earlier than this value are not included in the results. Only activities started within the last six weeks can be returned regardless of the value specified.
     
    * ``StartTimeUpperBound`` - The latest scaling activities to return based on the activity start time. Scaling activities with a start time later than this value are not included in the results. Only activities started within the last six weeks can be returned regardless of the value specified.
     
    * ``Status`` - The ``StatusCode`` value of the scaling activity. This filter can only be used in combination with the ``AutoScalingGroupName`` parameter. For valid ``StatusCode`` values, see `Activity <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_Activity.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling API Reference*.
    

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      Describes a filter that is used to return a more specific list of results from a describe operation.

       

      If you specify multiple filters, the filters are automatically logically joined with an ``AND``, and the request returns only the results that match all of the specified filters.

       

      For more information, see `Tag Auto Scaling groups and instances <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-tagging.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.

      

    
      - **Name** *(string) --* 

        The name of the filter.

         

        The valid values for ``Name`` depend on which API operation you're using with the filter.

         

        `DescribeAutoScalingGroups <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_DescribeAutoScalingGroups.html>`__

         

        Valid values for ``Name`` include the following:

         

        
        * ``tag-key`` - Accepts tag keys. The results only include information about the Auto Scaling groups associated with these tag keys.
         
        * ``tag-value`` - Accepts tag values. The results only include information about the Auto Scaling groups associated with these tag values.
         
        * ``tag:<key>`` - Accepts the key/value combination of the tag. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value. The results only include information about the Auto Scaling groups associated with the specified key/value combination.
        

         

        `DescribeTags <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_DescribeTags.html>`__

         

        Valid values for ``Name`` include the following:

         

        
        * ``auto-scaling-group`` - Accepts the names of Auto Scaling groups. The results only include information about the tags associated with these Auto Scaling groups.
         
        * ``key`` - Accepts tag keys. The results only include information about the tags associated with these tag keys.
         
        * ``value`` - Accepts tag values. The results only include information about the tags associated with these tag values.
         
        * ``propagate-at-launch`` - Accepts a Boolean value, which specifies whether tags propagate to instances at launch. The results only include information about the tags associated with the specified Boolean value.
        

         

        `DescribeScalingActivities <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_DescribeScalingActivities.html>`__

         

        Valid values for ``Name`` include the following:

         

        
        * ``StartTimeLowerBound`` - The earliest scaling activities to return based on the activity start time. Scaling activities with a start time earlier than this value are not included in the results. Only activities started within the last six weeks can be returned regardless of the value specified.
         
        * ``StartTimeUpperBound`` - The latest scaling activities to return based on the activity start time. Scaling activities with a start time later than this value are not included in the results. Only activities started within the last six weeks can be returned regardless of the value specified.
         
        * ``Status`` - The ``StatusCode`` value of the scaling activity. This filter can only be used in combination with the ``AutoScalingGroupName`` parameter. For valid ``StatusCode`` values, see `Activity <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_Activity.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling API Reference*.
        

        

      
      - **Values** *(list) --* 

        One or more filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

         

        If you specify multiple values for a filter, the values are automatically logically joined with an ``OR``, and the request returns all results that match any of the specified values.

         

        **DescribeAutoScalingGroups example:** Specify "tag:environment" for the filter name and "production,development" for the filter values to find Auto Scaling groups with the tag "environment=production" or "environment=development".

         

        **DescribeScalingActivities example:** Specify "Status" for the filter name and "Successful,Failed" for the filter values to find scaling activities with a status of either "Successful" or "Failed".
