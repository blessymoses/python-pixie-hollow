.. py:method:: CloudWatch.Client.put_managed_insight_rules(**kwargs)

  

  Creates a managed Contributor Insights rule for a specified Amazon Web Services resource. When you enable a managed rule, you create a Contributor Insights rule that collects data from Amazon Web Services services. You cannot edit these rules with ``PutInsightRule``. The rules can be enabled, disabled, and deleted using ``EnableInsightRules``, ``DisableInsightRules``, and ``DeleteInsightRules``. If a previously created managed rule is currently disabled, a subsequent call to this API will re-enable it. Use ``ListManagedInsightRules`` to describe all available rules.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.put_managed_insight_rules(
        ManagedRules=[
            {
                'TemplateName': 'string',
                'ResourceARN': 'string',
                'Tags': [
                    {
                        'Key': 'string',
                        'Value': 'string'
                    },
                ]
            },
        ]
    )
    
  :type ManagedRules: list
  :param ManagedRules: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A list of ``ManagedRules`` to enable.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      Contains the information that's required to enable a managed Contributor Insights rule for an Amazon Web Services resource.

      

    
      - **TemplateName** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The template name for the managed Contributor Insights rule, as returned by ``ListManagedInsightRules``.

        

      
      - **ResourceARN** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The ARN of an Amazon Web Services resource that has managed Contributor Insights rules.

        

      
      - **Tags** *(list) --* 

        A list of key-value pairs that you can associate with a managed Contributor Insights rule. You can associate as many as 50 tags with a rule. Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You also can use them to scope user permissions by granting a user permission to access or change only the resources that have certain tag values. To associate tags with a rule, you must have the ``cloudwatch:TagResource`` permission in addition to the ``cloudwatch:PutInsightRule`` permission. If you are using this operation to update an existing Contributor Insights rule, any tags that you specify in this parameter are ignored. To change the tags of an existing rule, use ``TagResource``.

        

      
        - *(dict) --* 

          A key-value pair associated with a CloudWatch resource.

          

        
          - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            A string that you can use to assign a value. The combination of tag keys and values can help you organize and categorize your resources.

            

          
          - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The value for the specified tag key.
