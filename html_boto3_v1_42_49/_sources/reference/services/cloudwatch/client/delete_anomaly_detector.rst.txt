  :type Namespace: string
  :param Namespace: 

    The namespace associated with the anomaly detection model to delete.

    

  
  :type MetricName: string
  :param MetricName: 

    The metric name associated with the anomaly detection model to delete.

    

  
  :type Dimensions: list
  :param Dimensions: 

    The metric dimensions associated with the anomaly detection model to delete.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      A dimension is a name/value pair that is part of the identity of a metric. Because dimensions are part of the unique identifier for a metric, whenever you add a unique name/value pair to one of your metrics, you are creating a new variation of that metric. For example, many Amazon EC2 metrics publish ``InstanceId`` as a dimension name, and the actual instance ID as the value for that dimension.

       

      You can assign up to 30 dimensions to a metric.

      

    
      - **Name** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The name of the dimension. Dimension names must contain only ASCII characters, must include at least one non-whitespace character, and cannot start with a colon ( ``:``). ASCII control characters are not supported as part of dimension names.

        

      
      - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The value of the dimension. Dimension values must contain only ASCII characters and must include at least one non-whitespace character. ASCII control characters are not supported as part of dimension values.

        

      
    

  :type Stat: string
  :param Stat: 

    The statistic associated with the anomaly detection model to delete.

    

  
  :type SingleMetricAnomalyDetector: dict
  :param SingleMetricAnomalyDetector: 

    A single metric anomaly detector to be deleted.

     

    When using ``SingleMetricAnomalyDetector``, you cannot include the following parameters in the same operation:

     

    
    * ``Dimensions``,
     
    * ``MetricName``
     
    * ``Namespace``
     
    * ``Stat``
     
    * the ``MetricMathAnomalyDetector`` parameters of ``DeleteAnomalyDetectorInput``
    

     

    Instead, specify the single metric anomaly detector attributes as part of the ``SingleMetricAnomalyDetector`` property.

    

  
    - **AccountId** *(string) --* 

      If the CloudWatch metric that provides the time series that the anomaly detector uses as input is in another account, specify that account ID here. If you omit this parameter, the current account is used.

      

    
    - **Namespace** *(string) --* 

      The namespace of the metric to create the anomaly detection model for.

      

    
    - **MetricName** *(string) --* 

      The name of the metric to create the anomaly detection model for.

      

    
    - **Dimensions** *(list) --* 

      The metric dimensions to create the anomaly detection model for.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        A dimension is a name/value pair that is part of the identity of a metric. Because dimensions are part of the unique identifier for a metric, whenever you add a unique name/value pair to one of your metrics, you are creating a new variation of that metric. For example, many Amazon EC2 metrics publish ``InstanceId`` as a dimension name, and the actual instance ID as the value for that dimension.

         

        You can assign up to 30 dimensions to a metric.

        

      
        - **Name** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The name of the dimension. Dimension names must contain only ASCII characters, must include at least one non-whitespace character, and cannot start with a colon ( ``:``). ASCII control characters are not supported as part of dimension names.

          

        
        - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The value of the dimension. Dimension values must contain only ASCII characters and must include at least one non-whitespace character. ASCII control characters are not supported as part of dimension values.

          

        
      
  
    - **Stat** *(string) --* 

      The statistic to use for the metric and anomaly detection model.

      

    
  
  :type MetricMathAnomalyDetector: dict
  :param MetricMathAnomalyDetector: 

    The metric math anomaly detector to be deleted.

     

    When using ``MetricMathAnomalyDetector``, you cannot include following parameters in the same operation:

     

    
    * ``Dimensions``,
     
    * ``MetricName``
     
    * ``Namespace``
     
    * ``Stat``
     
    * the ``SingleMetricAnomalyDetector`` parameters of ``DeleteAnomalyDetectorInput``
    

     

    Instead, specify the metric math anomaly detector attributes as part of the ``MetricMathAnomalyDetector`` property.

    

  
    - **MetricDataQueries** *(list) --* 

      An array of metric data query structures that enables you to create an anomaly detector based on the result of a metric math expression. Each item in ``MetricDataQueries`` gets a metric or performs a math expression. One item in ``MetricDataQueries`` is the expression that provides the time series that the anomaly detector uses as input. Designate the expression by setting ``ReturnData`` to ``true`` for this object in the array. For all other expressions and metrics, set ``ReturnData`` to ``false``. The designated expression must return a single time series.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        This structure is used in both ``GetMetricData`` and ``PutMetricAlarm``. The supported use of this structure is different for those two operations.

         

        When used in ``GetMetricData``, it indicates the metric data to return, and whether this call is just retrieving a batch set of data for one metric, or is performing a Metrics Insights query or a math expression. A single ``GetMetricData`` call can include up to 500 ``MetricDataQuery`` structures.

         

        When used in ``PutMetricAlarm``, it enables you to create an alarm based on a metric math expression. Each ``MetricDataQuery`` in the array specifies either a metric to retrieve, or a math expression to be performed on retrieved metrics. A single ``PutMetricAlarm`` call can include up to 20 ``MetricDataQuery`` structures in the array. The 20 structures can include as many as 10 structures that contain a ``MetricStat`` parameter to retrieve a metric, and as many as 10 structures that contain the ``Expression`` parameter to perform a math expression. Of those ``Expression`` structures, one must have ``true`` as the value for ``ReturnData``. The result of this expression is the value the alarm watches.

         

        Any expression used in a ``PutMetricAlarm`` operation must return a single time series. For more information, see `Metric Math Syntax and Functions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/using-metric-math.html#metric-math-syntax>`__ in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*.

         

        Some of the parameters of this structure also have different uses whether you are using this structure in a ``GetMetricData`` operation or a ``PutMetricAlarm`` operation. These differences are explained in the following parameter list.

        

      
        - **Id** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          A short name used to tie this object to the results in the response. This name must be unique within a single call to ``GetMetricData``. If you are performing math expressions on this set of data, this name represents that data and can serve as a variable in the mathematical expression. The valid characters are letters, numbers, and underscore. The first character must be a lowercase letter.

          

        
        - **MetricStat** *(dict) --* 

          The metric to be returned, along with statistics, period, and units. Use this parameter only if this object is retrieving a metric and not performing a math expression on returned data.

           

          Within one MetricDataQuery object, you must specify either ``Expression`` or ``MetricStat`` but not both.

          

        
          - **Metric** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The metric to return, including the metric name, namespace, and dimensions.

            

          
            - **Namespace** *(string) --* 

              The namespace of the metric.

              

            
            - **MetricName** *(string) --* 

              The name of the metric. This is a required field.

              

            
            - **Dimensions** *(list) --* 

              The dimensions for the metric.

              

            
              - *(dict) --* 

                A dimension is a name/value pair that is part of the identity of a metric. Because dimensions are part of the unique identifier for a metric, whenever you add a unique name/value pair to one of your metrics, you are creating a new variation of that metric. For example, many Amazon EC2 metrics publish ``InstanceId`` as a dimension name, and the actual instance ID as the value for that dimension.

                 

                You can assign up to 30 dimensions to a metric.

                

              
                - **Name** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                  The name of the dimension. Dimension names must contain only ASCII characters, must include at least one non-whitespace character, and cannot start with a colon ( ``:``). ASCII control characters are not supported as part of dimension names.

                  

                
                - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                  The value of the dimension. Dimension values must contain only ASCII characters and must include at least one non-whitespace character. ASCII control characters are not supported as part of dimension values.

                  

                
              
          
          
          - **Period** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The granularity, in seconds, of the returned data points. For metrics with regular resolution, a period can be as short as one minute (60 seconds) and must be a multiple of 60. For high-resolution metrics that are collected at intervals of less than one minute, the period can be 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, or any multiple of 60. High-resolution metrics are those metrics stored by a ``PutMetricData`` call that includes a ``StorageResolution`` of 1 second.

             

            If the ``StartTime`` parameter specifies a time stamp that is greater than 3 hours ago, you must specify the period as follows or no data points in that time range is returned:

             

            
            * Start time between 3 hours and 15 days ago - Use a multiple of 60 seconds (1 minute).
             
            * Start time between 15 and 63 days ago - Use a multiple of 300 seconds (5 minutes).
             
            * Start time greater than 63 days ago - Use a multiple of 3600 seconds (1 hour).
            

            

          
          - **Stat** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The statistic to return. It can include any CloudWatch statistic or extended statistic.

            

          
          - **Unit** *(string) --* 

            When you are using a ``Put`` operation, this defines what unit you want to use when storing the metric.

             

            In a ``Get`` operation, if you omit ``Unit`` then all data that was collected with any unit is returned, along with the corresponding units that were specified when the data was reported to CloudWatch. If you specify a unit, the operation returns only data that was collected with that unit specified. If you specify a unit that does not match the data collected, the results of the operation are null. CloudWatch does not perform unit conversions.

            

          
        
        - **Expression** *(string) --* 

          This field can contain either a Metrics Insights query, or a metric math expression to be performed on the returned data. For more information about Metrics Insights queries, see `Metrics Insights query components and syntax <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch-metrics-insights-querylanguage>`__ in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*.

           

          A math expression can use the ``Id`` of the other metrics or queries to refer to those metrics, and can also use the ``Id`` of other expressions to use the result of those expressions. For more information about metric math expressions, see `Metric Math Syntax and Functions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/using-metric-math.html#metric-math-syntax>`__ in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*.

           

          Within each MetricDataQuery object, you must specify either ``Expression`` or ``MetricStat`` but not both.

          

        
        - **Label** *(string) --* 

          A human-readable label for this metric or expression. This is especially useful if this is an expression, so that you know what the value represents. If the metric or expression is shown in a CloudWatch dashboard widget, the label is shown. If Label is omitted, CloudWatch generates a default.

           

          You can put dynamic expressions into a label, so that it is more descriptive. For more information, see `Using Dynamic Labels <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/graph-dynamic-labels.html>`__.

          

        
        - **ReturnData** *(boolean) --* 

          When used in ``GetMetricData``, this option indicates whether to return the timestamps and raw data values of this metric. If you are performing this call just to do math expressions and do not also need the raw data returned, you can specify ``false``. If you omit this, the default of ``true`` is used.

           

          When used in ``PutMetricAlarm``, specify ``true`` for the one expression result to use as the alarm. For all other metrics and expressions in the same ``PutMetricAlarm`` operation, specify ``ReturnData`` as False.

          

        
        - **Period** *(integer) --* 

          The granularity, in seconds, of the returned data points. For metrics with regular resolution, a period can be as short as one minute (60 seconds) and must be a multiple of 60. For high-resolution metrics that are collected at intervals of less than one minute, the period can be 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, or any multiple of 60. High-resolution metrics are those metrics stored by a ``PutMetricData`` operation that includes a ``StorageResolution of 1 second``.

          

        
        - **AccountId** *(string) --* 

          The ID of the account where the metrics are located.

           

          If you are performing a ``GetMetricData`` operation in a monitoring account, use this to specify which account to retrieve this metric from.

           

          If you are performing a ``PutMetricAlarm`` operation, use this to specify which account contains the metric that the alarm is watching.
