    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **Arn** *(string) --* 

        The ARN of the metric stream.

        
      

      - **Name** *(string) --* 

        The name of the metric stream.

        
      

      - **IncludeFilters** *(list) --* 

        If this array of metric namespaces is present, then these namespaces are the only metric namespaces that are streamed by this metric stream.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          This structure contains a metric namespace and optionally, a list of metric names, to either include in a metric stream or exclude from a metric stream.

           

          A metric stream's filters can include up to 1000 total names. This limit applies to the sum of namespace names and metric names in the filters. For example, this could include 10 metric namespace filters with 99 metrics each, or 20 namespace filters with 49 metrics specified in each filter.

          
          

          - **Namespace** *(string) --* 

            The name of the metric namespace for this filter.

             

            The namespace can contain only ASCII printable characters (ASCII range 32 through 126). It must contain at least one non-whitespace character.

            
          

          - **MetricNames** *(list) --* 

            The names of the metrics to either include or exclude from the metric stream.

             

            If you omit this parameter, all metrics in the namespace are included or excluded, depending on whether this filter is specified as an exclude filter or an include filter.

             

            Each metric name can contain only ASCII printable characters (ASCII range 32 through 126). Each metric name must contain at least one non-whitespace character.

            
            

            - *(string) --* 
        
      
    
      

      - **ExcludeFilters** *(list) --* 

        If this array of metric namespaces is present, then these namespaces are the only metric namespaces that are not streamed by this metric stream. In this case, all other metric namespaces in the account are streamed by this metric stream.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          This structure contains a metric namespace and optionally, a list of metric names, to either include in a metric stream or exclude from a metric stream.

            The name of the metric namespace for this filter.

             

            The namespace can contain only ASCII printable characters (ASCII range 32 through 126). It must contain at least one non-whitespace character.

            
          

          - **MetricNames** *(list) --* 

            The names of the metrics to either include or exclude from the metric stream.

             

            If you omit this parameter, all metrics in the namespace are included or excluded, depending on whether this filter is specified as an exclude filter or an include filter.

             

            Each metric name can contain only ASCII printable characters (ASCII range 32 through 126). Each metric name must contain at least one non-whitespace character.

            
            

            - *(string) --* 
        
      
    
      

      - **FirehoseArn** *(string) --*

      - **RoleArn** *(string) --* 

        The ARN of the IAM role that is used by this metric stream.

        
      

      - **State** *(string) --* 

        The state of the metric stream. The possible values are ``running`` and ``stopped``.

        
      

      - **CreationDate** *(datetime) --* 

        The date that the metric stream was created.

        
      

      - **LastUpdateDate** *(datetime) --* 

        The date of the most recent update to the metric stream's configuration.

        
      

      - **OutputFormat** *(string) --* 

        The output format for the stream. Valid values are ``json``, ``opentelemetry1.0``, and ``opentelemetry0.7``. For more information about metric stream output formats, see `Metric streams output formats <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-metric-streams-formats.html>`__.

        
      

      - **StatisticsConfigurations** *(list) --* 

        Each entry in this array displays information about one or more metrics that include additional statistics in the metric stream. For more information about the additional statistics, see `CloudWatch statistics definitions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Statistics-definitions.html.html>`__.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          By default, a metric stream always sends the ``MAX``, ``MIN``, ``SUM``, and ``SAMPLECOUNT`` statistics for each metric that is streamed. This structure contains information for one metric that includes additional statistics in the stream. For more information about statistics, see CloudWatch, listed in `CloudWatch statistics definitions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Statistics-definitions.html.html>`__.

          
          

          - **IncludeMetrics** *(list) --* 

            An array of metric name and namespace pairs that stream the additional statistics listed in the value of the ``AdditionalStatistics`` parameter. There can be as many as 100 pairs in the array.

             

            All metrics that match the combination of metric name and namespace will be streamed with the additional statistics, no matter their dimensions.

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

              This object contains the information for one metric that is to be streamed with additional statistics.

              
              

              - **Namespace** *(string) --* 

                The namespace of the metric.

                
              

              - **MetricName** *(string) --* 

                The name of the metric.

                
          
        
          

          - **AdditionalStatistics** *(list) --* 

            The list of additional statistics that are to be streamed for the metrics listed in the ``IncludeMetrics`` array in this structure. This list can include as many as 20 statistics.

             

            If the ``OutputFormat`` for the stream is ``opentelemetry1.0`` or ``opentelemetry0.7``, the only valid values are ``p??`` percentile statistics such as ``p90``, ``p99`` and so on.

             

            If the ``OutputFormat`` for the stream is ``json``, the valid values include the abbreviations for all of the statistics listed in `CloudWatch statistics definitions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Statistics-definitions.html.html>`__. For example, this includes ``tm98,`` ``wm90``, ``PR(:300)``, and so on.

            
            

            - *(string) --* 
        
      
    
      

      - **IncludeLinkedAccountsMetrics** *(boolean) --* 

        If this is ``true`` and this metric stream is in a monitoring account, then the stream includes metrics from source accounts that the monitoring account is linked to.
