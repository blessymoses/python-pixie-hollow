.. py:method:: CloudWatch.Client.put_dashboard(**kwargs)

  

  Creates a dashboard if it does not already exist, or updates an existing dashboard. If you update a dashboard, the entire contents are replaced with what you specify here.

   

  All dashboards in your account are global, not region-specific.

   

  A simple way to create a dashboard using ``PutDashboard`` is to copy an existing dashboard. To copy an existing dashboard using the console, you can load the dashboard and then use the View/edit source command in the Actions menu to display the JSON block for that dashboard. Another way to copy a dashboard is to use ``GetDashboard``, and then use the data returned within ``DashboardBody`` as the template for the new dashboard when you call ``PutDashboard``.

   

  When you create a dashboard with ``PutDashboard``, a good practice is to add a text widget at the top of the dashboard with a message that the dashboard was created by script and should not be changed in the console. This message could also point console users to the location of the ``DashboardBody`` script or the CloudFormation template used to create the dashboard.

    - *(dict) --*

        If this result includes error messages, the input was not valid and the operation failed.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          An error or warning for the operation.

          
          

          - **DataPath** *(string) --* 

            The data path related to the message.
