.. py:method:: CloudWatch.Client.list_dashboards(**kwargs)

  

  Returns a list of the dashboards for your account. If you include ``DashboardNamePrefix``, only those dashboards with names starting with the prefix are listed. Otherwise, all dashboards in your account are listed.

   

  ``ListDashboards`` returns up to 1000 results on one page. If there are more than 1000 dashboards, you can call ``ListDashboards`` again and include the value you received for ``NextToken`` in the first call, to receive the next 1000 results.
