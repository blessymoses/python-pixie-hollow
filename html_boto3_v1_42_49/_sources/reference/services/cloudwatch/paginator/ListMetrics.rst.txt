      response_iterator = paginator.paginate(
          Namespace='string',
          MetricName='string',
          Dimensions=[
              {
                  'Name': 'string',
                  'Value': 'string'
              },

          }
      )
      
    :type Namespace: string
    :param Namespace: 

      The metric namespace to filter against. Only the namespace that matches exactly will be returned.

      

    
    :type MetricName: string
    :param MetricName: 

      The name of the metric to filter against. Only the metrics with names that match exactly will be returned.

      

    
    :type Dimensions: list
    :param Dimensions: 

      The dimensions to filter against. Only the dimension with names that match exactly will be returned. If you specify one dimension name and a metric has that dimension and also other dimensions, it will be returned.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        Represents filters for a dimension.

        

      
        - **Name** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The dimension name to be matched.

          

        
        - **Value** *(string) --* 

          The value of the dimension to be matched.

          

        
      
  
    :type RecentlyActive: string
    :param RecentlyActive: 

      To filter the results to show only metrics that have had data points published in the past three hours, specify this parameter with a value of ``PT3H``. This is the only valid value for this parameter.

       

      The results that are returned are an approximation of the value you specify. There is a low probability that the returned results include metrics with last published data as much as 50 minutes more than the specified time interval.

      

    
    :type IncludeLinkedAccounts: boolean
    :param IncludeLinkedAccounts: 

      If you are using this operation in a monitoring account, specify ``true`` to include metrics from source accounts in the returned data.

       

      The default is ``false``.

      

    
    :type OwningAccount: string
    :param OwningAccount: 

      When you use this operation in a monitoring account, use this field to return metrics only from one source account. To do so, specify that source account ID in this field, and also specify ``true`` for ``IncludeLinkedAccounts``.

      

    
    :type PaginationConfig: dict
    :param PaginationConfig: 

      A dictionary that provides parameters to control pagination.

      

    
      - **MaxItems** *(integer) --* 

        The total number of items to return. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified in max-items then a ``NextToken`` will be provided in the output that you can use to resume pagination.

        

      
      - **StartingToken** *(string) --* 

        A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previous response.

      **Response Structure**

      

      - *(dict) --* 
        

        - **Metrics** *(list) --* 

          The metrics that match your request.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            Represents a specific metric.

            
            

            - **Namespace** *(string) --* 

              The namespace of the metric.

              
            

            - **MetricName** *(string) --* 

              The name of the metric. This is a required field.

              
            

            - **Dimensions** *(list) --* 

              The dimensions for the metric.

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                A dimension is a name/value pair that is part of the identity of a metric. Because dimensions are part of the unique identifier for a metric, whenever you add a unique name/value pair to one of your metrics, you are creating a new variation of that metric. For example, many Amazon EC2 metrics publish ``InstanceId`` as a dimension name, and the actual instance ID as the value for that dimension.

                 

                You can assign up to 30 dimensions to a metric.

                
                

                - **Name** *(string) --* 

                  The name of the dimension. Dimension names must contain only ASCII characters, must include at least one non-whitespace character, and cannot start with a colon ( ``:``). ASCII control characters are not supported as part of dimension names.

                  
                

                - **Value** *(string) --* 

                  The value of the dimension. Dimension values must contain only ASCII characters and must include at least one non-whitespace character. ASCII control characters are not supported as part of dimension values.

                  
            
          
        
      
        

        - **OwningAccounts** *(list) --* 

          If you are using this operation in a monitoring account, this array contains the account IDs of the source accounts where the metrics in the returned data are from.

           

          This field is a 1:1 mapping between each metric that is returned and the ID of the owning account.

          
          

          - *(string) --*
