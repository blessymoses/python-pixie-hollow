    :type MetricDataQueries: list
    :param MetricDataQueries: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The metric queries to be returned. A single ``GetMetricData`` call can include as many as 500 ``MetricDataQuery`` structures. Each of these structures can specify either a metric to retrieve, a Metrics Insights query, or a math expression to perform on retrieved data.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        This structure is used in both ``GetMetricData`` and ``PutMetricAlarm``. The supported use of this structure is different for those two operations.

         

        When used in ``GetMetricData``, it indicates the metric data to return, and whether this call is just retrieving a batch set of data for one metric, or is performing a Metrics Insights query or a math expression. A single ``GetMetricData`` call can include up to 500 ``MetricDataQuery`` structures.

         

        When used in ``PutMetricAlarm``, it enables you to create an alarm based on a metric math expression. Each ``MetricDataQuery`` in the array specifies either a metric to retrieve, or a math expression to be performed on retrieved metrics. A single ``PutMetricAlarm`` call can include up to 20 ``MetricDataQuery`` structures in the array. The 20 structures can include as many as 10 structures that contain a ``MetricStat`` parameter to retrieve a metric, and as many as 10 structures that contain the ``Expression`` parameter to perform a math expression. Of those ``Expression`` structures, one must have ``true`` as the value for ``ReturnData``. The result of this expression is the value the alarm watches.

         

        Any expression used in a ``PutMetricAlarm`` operation must return a single time series. For more information, see `Metric Math Syntax and Functions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/using-metric-math.html#metric-math-syntax>`__ in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*.

         

        Some of the parameters of this structure also have different uses whether you are using this structure in a ``GetMetricData`` operation or a ``PutMetricAlarm`` operation. These differences are explained in the following parameter list.

        

      
        - **Id** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          A short name used to tie this object to the results in the response. This name must be unique within a single call to ``GetMetricData``. If you are performing math expressions on this set of data, this name represents that data and can serve as a variable in the mathematical expression. The valid characters are letters, numbers, and underscore. The first character must be a lowercase letter.

          

        
        - **MetricStat** *(dict) --* 

          The metric to be returned, along with statistics, period, and units. Use this parameter only if this object is retrieving a metric and not performing a math expression on returned data.

           

          Within one MetricDataQuery object, you must specify either ``Expression`` or ``MetricStat`` but not both.

          

        
          - **Metric** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The metric to return, including the metric name, namespace, and dimensions.

            

          
            - **Namespace** *(string) --* 

              The namespace of the metric.

              

            
            - **MetricName** *(string) --* 

              The name of the metric. This is a required field.

              

            
            - **Dimensions** *(list) --* 

              The dimensions for the metric.

              

            
              - *(dict) --* 

                A dimension is a name/value pair that is part of the identity of a metric. Because dimensions are part of the unique identifier for a metric, whenever you add a unique name/value pair to one of your metrics, you are creating a new variation of that metric. For example, many Amazon EC2 metrics publish ``InstanceId`` as a dimension name, and the actual instance ID as the value for that dimension.

                 

                You can assign up to 30 dimensions to a metric.

                

              
                - **Name** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                  The name of the dimension. Dimension names must contain only ASCII characters, must include at least one non-whitespace character, and cannot start with a colon ( ``:``). ASCII control characters are not supported as part of dimension names.

                  

                
                - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

                  The value of the dimension. Dimension values must contain only ASCII characters and must include at least one non-whitespace character. ASCII control characters are not supported as part of dimension values.

                  

                
              
          
          
          - **Period** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The granularity, in seconds, of the returned data points. For metrics with regular resolution, a period can be as short as one minute (60 seconds) and must be a multiple of 60. For high-resolution metrics that are collected at intervals of less than one minute, the period can be 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, or any multiple of 60. High-resolution metrics are those metrics stored by a ``PutMetricData`` call that includes a ``StorageResolution`` of 1 second.

             

            If the ``StartTime`` parameter specifies a time stamp that is greater than 3 hours ago, you must specify the period as follows or no data points in that time range is returned:

             

            
            * Start time between 3 hours and 15 days ago - Use a multiple of 60 seconds (1 minute).
             
            * Start time between 15 and 63 days ago - Use a multiple of 300 seconds (5 minutes).
             
            * Start time greater than 63 days ago - Use a multiple of 3600 seconds (1 hour).
            

            

          
          - **Stat** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The statistic to return. It can include any CloudWatch statistic or extended statistic.

            

          
          - **Unit** *(string) --* 

            When you are using a ``Put`` operation, this defines what unit you want to use when storing the metric.

             

            In a ``Get`` operation, if you omit ``Unit`` then all data that was collected with any unit is returned, along with the corresponding units that were specified when the data was reported to CloudWatch. If you specify a unit, the operation returns only data that was collected with that unit specified. If you specify a unit that does not match the data collected, the results of the operation are null. CloudWatch does not perform unit conversions.

            

          
        
        - **Expression** *(string) --* 

          This field can contain either a Metrics Insights query, or a metric math expression to be performed on the returned data. For more information about Metrics Insights queries, see `Metrics Insights query components and syntax <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch-metrics-insights-querylanguage>`__ in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*.

           

          A math expression can use the ``Id`` of the other metrics or queries to refer to those metrics, and can also use the ``Id`` of other expressions to use the result of those expressions. For more information about metric math expressions, see `Metric Math Syntax and Functions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/using-metric-math.html#metric-math-syntax>`__ in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*.

           

          Within each MetricDataQuery object, you must specify either ``Expression`` or ``MetricStat`` but not both.

          

        
        - **Label** *(string) --* 

          A human-readable label for this metric or expression. This is especially useful if this is an expression, so that you know what the value represents. If the metric or expression is shown in a CloudWatch dashboard widget, the label is shown. If Label is omitted, CloudWatch generates a default.

           

          You can put dynamic expressions into a label, so that it is more descriptive. For more information, see `Using Dynamic Labels <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/graph-dynamic-labels.html>`__.

          

        
        - **ReturnData** *(boolean) --* 

          When used in ``GetMetricData``, this option indicates whether to return the timestamps and raw data values of this metric. If you are performing this call just to do math expressions and do not also need the raw data returned, you can specify ``false``. If you omit this, the default of ``true`` is used.

           

          When used in ``PutMetricAlarm``, specify ``true`` for the one expression result to use as the alarm. For all other metrics and expressions in the same ``PutMetricAlarm`` operation, specify ``ReturnData`` as False.

          

        
        - **Period** *(integer) --* 

          The granularity, in seconds, of the returned data points. For metrics with regular resolution, a period can be as short as one minute (60 seconds) and must be a multiple of 60. For high-resolution metrics that are collected at intervals of less than one minute, the period can be 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, or any multiple of 60. High-resolution metrics are those metrics stored by a ``PutMetricData`` operation that includes a ``StorageResolution of 1 second``.

          

        
        - **AccountId** *(string) --* 

          The ID of the account where the metrics are located.

           

          If you are performing a ``GetMetricData`` operation in a monitoring account, use this to specify which account to retrieve this metric from.

           

          If you are performing a ``PutMetricAlarm`` operation, use this to specify which account contains the metric that the alarm is watching.

          

        
      
  
    :type StartTime: datetime
    :param StartTime: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The time stamp indicating the earliest data to be returned.

       

      The value specified is inclusive; results include data points with the specified time stamp.

       

      CloudWatch rounds the specified time stamp as follows:

       

      
      * Start time less than 15 days ago - Round down to the nearest whole minute. For example, 12:32:34 is rounded down to 12:32:00.
       
      * Start time between 15 and 63 days ago - Round down to the nearest 5-minute clock interval. For example, 12:32:34 is rounded down to 12:30:00.
       
      * Start time greater than 63 days ago - Round down to the nearest 1-hour clock interval. For example, 12:32:34 is rounded down to 12:00:00.
      

       

      If you set ``Period`` to 5, 10, 20, or 30, the start time of your request is rounded down to the nearest time that corresponds to even 5-, 10-, 20-, or 30-second divisions of a minute. For example, if you make a query at (HH:mm:ss) 01:05:23 for the previous 10-second period, the start time of your request is rounded down and you receive data from 01:05:10 to 01:05:20. If you make a query at 15:07:17 for the previous 5 minutes of data, using a period of 5 seconds, you receive data timestamped between 15:02:15 and 15:07:15.

       

      For better performance, specify ``StartTime`` and ``EndTime`` values that align with the value of the metric's ``Period`` and sync up with the beginning and end of an hour. For example, if the ``Period`` of a metric is 5 minutes, specifying 12:05 or 12:30 as ``StartTime`` can get a faster response from CloudWatch than setting 12:07 or 12:29 as the ``StartTime``.

      

    
    :type EndTime: datetime
    :param EndTime: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The time stamp indicating the latest data to be returned.

       

      The value specified is exclusive; results include data points up to the specified time stamp.

       

      For better performance, specify ``StartTime`` and ``EndTime`` values that align with the value of the metric's ``Period`` and sync up with the beginning and end of an hour. For example, if the ``Period`` of a metric is 5 minutes, specifying 12:05 or 12:30 as ``EndTime`` can get a faster response from CloudWatch than setting 12:07 or 12:29 as the ``EndTime``.

      

    
    :type ScanBy: string
    :param ScanBy: 

      The order in which data points should be returned. ``TimestampDescending`` returns the newest data first and paginates when the ``MaxDatapoints`` limit is reached. ``TimestampAscending`` returns the oldest data first and paginates when the ``MaxDatapoints`` limit is reached.

       

      If you omit this parameter, the default of ``TimestampDescending`` is used.

      

    
    :type LabelOptions: dict
    :param LabelOptions: 

      This structure includes the ``Timezone`` parameter, which you can use to specify your time zone so that the labels of returned data display the correct time for your time zone.

      

    
      - **Timezone** *(string) --* 

        The time zone to use for metric data return in this operation. The format is ``+`` or ``-`` followed by four digits. The first two digits indicate the number of hours ahead or behind of UTC, and the final two digits are the number of minutes. For example, +0130 indicates a time zone that is 1 hour and 30 minutes ahead of UTC. The default is +0000.

        

      
    
    :type PaginationConfig: dict
    :param PaginationConfig: 

      A dictionary that provides parameters to control pagination.

      

    
      - **MaxItems** *(integer) --* 

        The total number of items to return. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified in max-items then a ``NextToken`` will be provided in the output that you can use to resume pagination.

        

      
      - **PageSize** *(integer) --* 

        The size of each page.

        

      
      - **StartingToken** *(string) --* 

        A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previous response.

      **Response Structure**

      

      - *(dict) --* 
        

        - **MetricDataResults** *(list) --* 

          The metrics that are returned, including the metric name, namespace, and dimensions.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            A ``GetMetricData`` call returns an array of ``MetricDataResult`` structures. Each of these structures includes the data points for that metric, along with the timestamps of those data points and other identifying information.

            
            

            - **Id** *(string) --* 

              The short name you specified to represent this metric.

              
            

            - **Label** *(string) --* 

              The human-readable label associated with the data.

              
            

            - **Timestamps** *(list) --* 

              The timestamps for the data points, formatted in Unix timestamp format. The number of timestamps always matches the number of values and the value for Timestamps[x] is Values[x].

              
              

              - *(datetime) --* 
          
            

            - **Values** *(list) --* 

              The data points for the metric corresponding to ``Timestamps``. The number of values always matches the number of timestamps and the timestamp for Values[x] is Timestamps[x].

              
              

              - *(float) --* 
          
            

            - **StatusCode** *(string) --* 

              The status of the returned data. ``Complete`` indicates that all data points in the requested time range were returned. ``PartialData`` means that an incomplete set of data points were returned. You can use the ``NextToken`` value that was returned and repeat your request to get more data points. ``NextToken`` is not returned if you are performing a math expression. ``InternalError`` indicates that an error occurred. Retry your request using ``NextToken``, if present.

              
            

            - **Messages** *(list) --* 

              A list of messages with additional information about the data returned.

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                A message returned by the ``GetMetricData``API, including a code and a description.

                 

                If a cross-Region ``GetMetricData`` operation fails with a code of ``Forbidden`` and a value of ``Authentication too complex to retrieve cross region data``, you can correct the problem by running the ``GetMetricData`` operation in the same Region where the metric data is.

                
                

                - **Code** *(string) --* 

                  The error code or status code associated with the message.

        - **Messages** *(list) --* 

          Contains a message about this ``GetMetricData`` operation, if the operation results in such a message. An example of a message that might be returned is ``Maximum number of allowed metrics exceeded``. If there is a message, as much of the operation as possible is still executed.

           

          A message appears here only if it is related to the global ``GetMetricData`` operation. Any message about a specific metric returned by the operation appears in the ``MetricDataResult`` object returned for that metric.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            A message returned by the ``GetMetricData``API, including a code and a description.

             

            If a cross-Region ``GetMetricData`` operation fails with a code of ``Forbidden`` and a value of ``Authentication too complex to retrieve cross region data``, you can correct the problem by running the ``GetMetricData`` operation in the same Region where the metric data is.

            
            

            - **Code** *(string) --* 

              The error code or status code associated with the message.

              
            

            - **Value** *(string) --* 

              The message text.
