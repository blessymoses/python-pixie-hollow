.. py:attribute:: CloudWatch.Alarm.evaluate_low_sample_count_percentile

  

  - *(string) --* 

    Used only for alarms based on percentiles. If ``ignore``, the alarm state does not change during periods with too few data points to be statistically significant. If ``evaluate`` or this parameter is not used, the alarm is always evaluated and possibly changes state no matter how many data points are available.
