.. py:method:: CloudWatchEvidently.Client.update_experiment(**kwargs)

  

  Updates an Evidently experiment.

   

  Don't use this operation to update an experiment's tag. Instead, use `TagResource <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatchevidently/latest/APIReference/API_TagResource.html>`__.

  

  .. danger::

        This operation is deprecated and may not function as expected. This operation should not be used going forward and is only kept for the purpose of backwards compatiblity.

    The name of the experiment to update.

    

  
  :type metricGoals: list
  :param metricGoals: 

    An array of structures that defines the metrics used for the experiment, and whether a higher or lower value for each metric is the goal.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      Use this structure to tell Evidently whether higher or lower values are desired for a metric that is used in an experiment.

      

    
      - **desiredChange** *(string) --* 

        ``INCREASE`` means that a variation with a higher number for this metric is performing better.

         

        ``DECREASE`` means that a variation with a lower number for this metric is performing better.

        

      
      - **metricDefinition** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        A structure that contains details about the metric.

        

      
        - **entityIdKey** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The entity, such as a user or session, that does an action that causes a metric value to be recorded. An example is ``userDetails.userID``.

          

        
        - **eventPattern** *(string) --* 

          The EventBridge event pattern that defines how the metric is recorded.

           

          For more information about EventBridge event patterns, see `Amazon EventBridge event patterns <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-event-patterns.html>`__.

          The value that is tracked to produce the metric.

          

        
      
    

  :type onlineAbConfig: dict
  :param onlineAbConfig: 

    A structure that contains the configuration of which variation o use as the "control" version. The "control" version is used for comparison with other variations. This structure also specifies how much experiment traffic is allocated to each variation.

    

  
    - **controlTreatmentName** *(string) --* 

      The name of the variation that is to be the default variation that the other variations are compared to.

      - *(string) --* 

      
        - *(integer) --*

    The name or ARN of the project that contains the experiment that you want to update.

    

  
  :type randomizationSalt: string
  :param randomizationSalt: 

    When Evidently assigns a particular user session to an experiment, it must use a randomization ID to determine which variation the user session is served. This randomization ID is a combination of the entity ID and ``randomizationSalt``. If you omit ``randomizationSalt``, Evidently uses the experiment name as the ``randomizationSalt``.

    

  
  :type removeSegment: boolean

  :type segment: string
  :param segment:
