.. py:method:: CloudWatchEvidently.Client.update_project_data_delivery(**kwargs)

  

  Updates the data storage options for this project. If you store evaluation events, you an keep them and analyze them on your own. If you choose not to store evaluation events, Evidently deletes them after using them to produce metrics and other experiment results that you can view.

   

  You can't specify both ``cloudWatchLogs`` and ``s3Destination`` in the same operation.

  

  .. danger::

        This operation is deprecated and may not function as expected. This operation should not be used going forward and is only kept for the purpose of backwards compatiblity.
