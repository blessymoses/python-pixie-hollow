        - **onlineAbDefinition** *(dict) --* 

          A structure that contains the configuration of which variation to use as the "control" version. The "control" version is used for comparison with other variations. This structure also specifies how much experiment traffic is allocated to each variation.

          
          

          - **controlTreatmentName** *(string) --* 

            The name of the variation that is the default variation that the other variations are compared to.

            
          

          - **treatmentWeights** *(dict) --* 

            A set of key-value pairs. The keys are variation names, and the values are the portion of experiment traffic to be assigned to that variation. The traffic portion is specified in thousandths of a percent, so 20,000 for a variation would allocate 20% of the experiment traffic to that variation.

            
            

            - *(string) --*

        - **randomizationSalt** *(string) --* 

          This value is used when Evidently assigns a particular user session to the experiment. It helps create a randomization ID to determine which variation the user session is served. This randomization ID is a combination of the entity ID and ``randomizationSalt``.

          
        

        - **samplingRate** *(integer) --* 

          In thousandths of a percent, the amount of the available audience that is allocated to this experiment. The available audience is the total audience minus the audience that you have allocated to overrides or current launches of this feature.

           

          This is represented in thousandths of a percent, so a value of 10,000 is 10% of the available audience.

          
        

        - **schedule** *(dict) --* 

          A structure that contains the time and date that Evidently completed the analysis of the experiment.

          If the experiment was stopped, this is the string that was entered by the person who stopped the experiment, to explain why it was stopped.

          
        

        - **tags** *(dict) --* 

          The list of tag keys and values associated with this experiment.

          
          

          - *(string) --* 
            

            - *(string) --* 
      
    
        

        - **treatments** *(list) --*

            A structure that defines one treatment in an experiment. A treatment is a variation of the feature that you are including in the experiment.

              The description of the treatment.

              
            

            - **featureVariations** *(dict) --* 

              The feature variation used for this treatment. This is a key-value pair. The key is the feature name, and the value is the variation name.

              
              

              - *(string) --* 
                

                - *(string) --*
