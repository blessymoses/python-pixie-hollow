.. py:method:: CloudWatchEvidently.Client.create_launch(**kwargs)

  

  Creates a *launch* of a given feature. Before you create a launch, you must create the feature to use for the launch.

   

  You can use a launch to safely validate new features by serving them to a specified percentage of your users while you roll out the feature. You can monitor the performance of the new feature to help you decide when to ramp up traffic to more users. This helps you reduce risk and identify unintended consequences before you fully launch the feature.

   

  Don't use this operation to update an existing launch. Instead, use `UpdateLaunch <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatchevidently/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateLaunch.html>`__.

  

  .. danger::

        This operation is deprecated and may not function as expected. This operation should not be used going forward and is only kept for the purpose of backwards compatiblity.

  :type randomizationSalt: string
  :param randomizationSalt: 

    When Evidently assigns a particular user session to a launch, it must use a randomization ID to determine which variation the user session is served.

  :type scheduledSplitsConfig: dict
  :param scheduledSplitsConfig: 

    An array of structures that define the traffic allocation percentages among the feature variations during each step of the launch.

    

  
    - **steps** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      An array of structures that define the traffic allocation percentages among the feature variations during each step of the launch. This also defines the start time of each step.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        This structure defines the traffic allocation percentages among the feature variations during one step of a launch, and the start time of that step.

        

      
        - **groupWeights** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The traffic allocation percentages among the feature variations during one step of a launch. This is a set of key-value pairs. The keys are variation names. The values represent the percentage of traffic to allocate to that variation during this step.

           

          The values is expressed in thousandths of a percent, so assigning a weight of 50000 assigns 50% of traffic to that variation.

           

          If the sum of the weights for all the variations in a segment override does not add up to 100,000, then the remaining traffic that matches this segment is not assigned by this segment override, and instead moves on to the next segment override or the default traffic split.

          

        
          - *(string) --* 

          
            - *(integer) --* 

            
      
    
        - **segmentOverrides** *(list) --* 

          Use this parameter to specify different traffic splits for one or more audience *segments*. A segment is a portion of your audience that share one or more characteristics. Examples could be Chrome browser users, users in Europe, or Firefox browser users in Europe who also fit other criteria that your application collects, such as age.

           

          This parameter is an array of up to six segment override objects. Each of these objects specifies a segment that you have already created, and defines the traffic split for that segment.

          

        
          - *(dict) --* 

            This structure specifies a segment that you have already created, and defines the traffic split for that segment to be used in a launch.

            

          
            - **evaluationOrder** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

              A number indicating the order to use to evaluate segment overrides, if there are more than one. Segment overrides with lower numbers are evaluated first.

              

            
            - **segment** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

              The ARN of the segment to use.

              

            
            - **weights** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

              The traffic allocation percentages among the feature variations to assign to this segment. This is a set of key-value pairs. The keys are variation names. The values represent the amount of traffic to allocate to that variation for this segment. This is expressed in thousandths of a percent, so a weight of 50000 represents 50% of traffic.

              

            
              - *(string) --* 

              
                - *(integer) --* 

                
          
        
          
      
        - **startTime** *(datetime) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The date and time that this step of the launch starts.

          

        
      
  
  
  :type tags: dict
  :param tags: 

    Assigns one or more tags (key-value pairs) to the launch.

     

    Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also use them to scope user permissions by granting a user permission to access or change only resources with certain tag values.

     

    Tags don't have any semantic meaning to Amazon Web Services and are interpreted strictly as strings of characters.

     

    You can associate as many as 50 tags with a launch.

              - **segmentOverrides** *(list) --* 

                Use this parameter to specify different traffic splits for one or more audience *segments*. A segment is a portion of your audience that share one or more characteristics. Examples could be Chrome browser users, users in Europe, or Firefox browser users in Europe who also fit other criteria that your application collects, such as age.

                 

                This parameter is an array of up to six segment override objects. Each of these objects specifies a segment that you have already created, and defines the traffic split for that segment.

                
                

                - *(dict) --* 

                  This structure specifies a segment that you have already created, and defines the traffic split for that segment to be used in a launch.

                  
                  

                  - **evaluationOrder** *(integer) --* 

                    A number indicating the order to use to evaluate segment overrides, if there are more than one. Segment overrides with lower numbers are evaluated first.

                    
                  

                  - **segment** *(string) --* 

                    The ARN of the segment to use.

                    
                  

                  - **weights** *(dict) --* 

                    The traffic allocation percentages among the feature variations to assign to this segment. This is a set of key-value pairs. The keys are variation names. The values represent the amount of traffic to allocate to that variation for this segment. This is expressed in thousandths of a percent, so a weight of 50000 represents 50% of traffic.

                    
                    

                    - *(string) --* 
                      

                      - *(integer) --* 
                
              
              
            
              

              - **startTime** *(datetime) --* 

                The date and time that this step of the launch starts.

                
          
        
      
        

        - **status** *(string) --* 

          The current state of the launch.

          
        

        - **statusReason** *(string) --* 

          If the launch was stopped, this is the string that was entered by the person who stopped the launch, to explain why it was stopped.

          
        

        - **tags** *(dict) --* 

          The list of tag keys and values associated with this launch.

          
          

          - *(string) --* 
            

            - *(string) --* 
      
    
        

        - **type** *(string) --* 

          The type of launch.
