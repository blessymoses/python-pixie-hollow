    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **features** *(list) --* 

        An array of structures that contain the configuration details of the features in the specified project.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          This structure contains information about one Evidently feature in your account.

          
          

          - **arn** *(string) --* 

            The ARN of the feature.

            
          

          - **createdTime** *(datetime) --* 

            The date and time that the feature is created.

            
          

          - **defaultVariation** *(string) --* 

            The name of the variation that is used as the default variation. The default variation is served to users who are not allocated to any ongoing launches or experiments of this feature.

            
          

          - **evaluationRules** *(list) --* 

            An array of structures that define

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

              A structure that contains the information about an evaluation rule for this feature, if it is used in a launch or experiment.

              - **type** *(string) --* 

                This value is ``aws.evidently.splits`` if this is an evaluation rule for a launch, and it is ``aws.evidently.onlineab`` if this is an evaluation rule for an experiment.

                
          
        
          

          - **evaluationStrategy** *(string) --*

          - **lastUpdatedTime** *(datetime) --* 

            The date and time that the feature was most recently updated.
