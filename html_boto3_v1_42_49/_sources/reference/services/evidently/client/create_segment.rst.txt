.. py:method:: CloudWatchEvidently.Client.create_segment(**kwargs)

  

  Use this operation to define a *segment* of your audience. A segment is a portion of your audience that share one or more characteristics. Examples could be Chrome browser users, users in Europe, or Firefox browser users in Europe who also fit other criteria that your application collects, such as age.

   

  Using a segment in an experiment limits that experiment to evaluate only the users who match the segment criteria. Using one or more segments in a launch allows you to define different traffic splits for the different audience segments.

   

  For more information about segment pattern syntax, see `Segment rule pattern syntax <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Evidently-segments.html#CloudWatch-Evidently-segments-syntax.html>`__.

   

  The pattern that you define for a segment is matched against the value of ``evaluationContext``, which is passed into Evidently in the `EvaluateFeature <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatchevidently/latest/APIReference/API_EvaluateFeature.html>`__ operation, when Evidently assigns a feature variation to a user.

  

  .. danger::

        This operation is deprecated and may not function as expected. This operation should not be used going forward and is only kept for the purpose of backwards compatiblity.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.create_segment(
        description='string',
        name='string',
        pattern='string',
        tags={
            'string': 'string'
        }
    )
    
  :type description: string
  :param description: 

    An optional description for this segment.

    

  
  :type name: string
  :param name: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A name for the segment.

    

  
  :type pattern: string
  :param pattern: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The pattern to use for the segment. For more information about pattern syntax, see `Segment rule pattern syntax <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Evidently-segments.html#CloudWatch-Evidently-segments-syntax.html>`__.

    

  
  :type tags: dict
  :param tags: 

    Assigns one or more tags (key-value pairs) to the segment.

     

    Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also use them to scope user permissions by granting a user permission to access or change only resources with certain tag values.

     

    Tags don't have any semantic meaning to Amazon Web Services and are interpreted strictly as strings of characters.

     

    You can associate as many as 50 tags with a segment.

     

    For more information, see `Tagging Amazon Web Services resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html>`__.
