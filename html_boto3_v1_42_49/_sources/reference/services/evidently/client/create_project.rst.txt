.. py:method:: CloudWatchEvidently.Client.create_project(**kwargs)

  

  Creates a project, which is the logical object in Evidently that can contain features, launches, and experiments. Use projects to group similar features together.

   

  To update an existing project, use `UpdateProject <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatchevidently/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateProject.html>`__.

        This operation is deprecated and may not function as expected. This operation should not be used going forward and is only kept for the purpose of backwards compatiblity.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.create_project(
        appConfigResource={
            'applicationId': 'string',
            'environmentId': 'string'
        },
        dataDelivery={
            'cloudWatchLogs': {
                'logGroup': 'string'
            },
            's3Destination': {
                'bucket': 'string',
                'prefix': 'string'
            }
        },
        description='string',
        name='string',
        tags={
            'string': 'string'
        }
    )
    
  :type appConfigResource: dict
  :param appConfigResource: 

    Use this parameter if the project will use *client-side evaluation powered by AppConfig*. Client-side evaluation allows your application to assign variations to user sessions locally instead of by calling the `EvaluateFeature <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatchevidently/latest/APIReference/API_EvaluateFeature.html>`__ operation. This mitigates the latency and availability risks that come with an API call. For more information, see `Client-side evaluation - powered by AppConfig. <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Evidently-client-side-evaluation.html>`__

     

    This parameter is a structure that contains information about the AppConfig application and environment that will be used as for client-side evaluation.

     

    To create a project that uses client-side evaluation, you must have the ``evidently:ExportProjectAsConfiguration`` permission.

    

  
    - **applicationId** *(string) --* 

      The ID of the AppConfig application to use for client-side evaluation.

      

    
    - **environmentId** *(string) --* 

      The ID of the AppConfig environment to use for client-side evaluation. This must be an environment that is within the application that you specify for ``applicationId``.

      

    
  
  :type dataDelivery: dict
  :param dataDelivery: 

    A structure that contains information about where Evidently is to store evaluation events for longer term storage, if you choose to do so. If you choose not to store these events, Evidently deletes them after using them to produce metrics and other experiment results that you can view.

    

  
    - **cloudWatchLogs** *(dict) --* 

      If the project stores evaluation events in CloudWatch Logs, this structure stores the log group name.

      

    
      - **logGroup** *(string) --* 

        The name of the log group where the project stores evaluation events.

        

      
    
    - **s3Destination** *(dict) --* 

      If the project stores evaluation events in an Amazon S3 bucket, this structure stores the bucket name and bucket prefix.

      

    
      - **bucket** *(string) --* 

        The name of the bucket in which Evidently stores evaluation events.

        

      
      - **prefix** *(string) --* 

        The bucket prefix in which Evidently stores evaluation events.

        

      
    
  
  :type description: string
  :param description: 

    An optional description of the project.

    

  
  :type name: string
  :param name: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name for the project.

    

  
  :type tags: dict
  :param tags: 

    Assigns one or more tags (key-value pairs) to the project.

     

    Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also use them to scope user permissions by granting a user permission to access or change only resources with certain tag values.

     

    Tags don't have any semantic meaning to Amazon Web Services and are interpreted strictly as strings of characters.

     

    You can associate as many as 50 tags with a project.

     

    For more information, see `Tagging Amazon Web Services resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html>`__.
