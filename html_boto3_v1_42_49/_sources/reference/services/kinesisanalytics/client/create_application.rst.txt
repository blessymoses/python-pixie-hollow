  .. note::

    

    This documentation is for version 1 of the Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics API, which only supports SQL applications. Version 2 of the API supports SQL and Java applications. For more information about version 2, see `Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics API V2 Documentation </kinesisanalytics/latest/apiv2/Welcome.html>`__.

    

   

  Creates an Amazon Kinesis Analytics application. You can configure each application with one streaming source as input, application code to process the input, and up to three destinations where you want Amazon Kinesis Analytics to write the output data from your application. For an overview, see `How it Works <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/dev/how-it-works.html>`__.

   

  In the input configuration, you map the streaming source to an in-application stream, which you can think of as a constantly updating table. In the mapping, you must provide a schema for the in-application stream and map each data column in the in-application stream to a data element in the streaming source.

   

  Your application code is one or more SQL statements that read input data, transform it, and generate output. Your application code can create one or more SQL artifacts like SQL streams or pumps.

   

  In the output configuration, you can configure the application to write data from in-application streams created in your applications to up to three destinations.

   

  To read data from your source stream or write data to destination streams, Amazon Kinesis Analytics needs your permissions. You grant these permissions by creating IAM roles. This operation requires permissions to perform the ``kinesisanalytics:CreateApplication`` action.

   

  For introductory exercises to create an Amazon Kinesis Analytics application, see `Getting Started <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/dev/getting-started.html>`__.

  :type ApplicationName: string
  :param ApplicationName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Name of your Amazon Kinesis Analytics application (for example, ``sample-app``).

    

  
  :type ApplicationDescription: string
  :param ApplicationDescription: 

    Summary description of the application.

    

  
  :type Inputs: list
  :param Inputs: 

    Use this parameter to configure the application input.

     

    You can configure your application to receive input from a single streaming source. In this configuration, you map this streaming source to an in-application stream that is created. Your application code can then query the in-application stream like a table (you can think of it as a constantly updating table).

     

    For the streaming source, you provide its Amazon Resource Name (ARN) and format of data on the stream (for example, JSON, CSV, etc.). You also must provide an IAM role that Amazon Kinesis Analytics can assume to read this stream on your behalf.

     

    To create the in-application stream, you need to specify a schema to transform your data into a schematized version used in SQL. In the schema, you provide the necessary mapping of the data elements in the streaming source to record columns in the in-app stream.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      When you configure the application input, you specify the streaming source, the in-application stream name that is created, and the mapping between the two. For more information, see `Configuring Application Input <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/dev/how-it-works-input.html>`__.

      

    
      - **NamePrefix** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        Name prefix to use when creating an in-application stream. Suppose that you specify a prefix "MyInApplicationStream." Amazon Kinesis Analytics then creates one or more (as per the ``InputParallelism`` count you specified) in-application streams with names "MyInApplicationStream_001," "MyInApplicationStream_002," and so on.

        

      
      - **InputProcessingConfiguration** *(dict) --* 

        The `InputProcessingConfiguration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/dev/API_InputProcessingConfiguration.html>`__ for the input. An input processor transforms records as they are received from the stream, before the application's SQL code executes. Currently, the only input processing configuration available is `InputLambdaProcessor <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/dev/API_InputLambdaProcessor.html>`__.

        

      
        - **InputLambdaProcessor** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The `InputLambdaProcessor <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/dev/API_InputLambdaProcessor.html>`__ that is used to preprocess the records in the stream before being processed by your application code.

          

        
          - **ResourceARN** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The ARN of the `AWS Lambda <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/>`__ function that operates on records in the stream.

             

            .. note::

              

              To specify an earlier version of the Lambda function than the latest, include the Lambda function version in the Lambda function ARN. For more information about Lambda ARNs, see `Example ARNs\: AWS Lambda </general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html#arn-syntax-lambda>`__

              

            

          
          - **RoleARN** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The ARN of the IAM role that is used to access the AWS Lambda function.

            

          
        
      
      - **KinesisStreamsInput** *(dict) --* 

        If the streaming source is an Amazon Kinesis stream, identifies the stream's Amazon Resource Name (ARN) and an IAM role that enables Amazon Kinesis Analytics to access the stream on your behalf.

         

        Note: Either ``KinesisStreamsInput`` or ``KinesisFirehoseInput`` is required.

          ARN of the IAM role that Amazon Kinesis Analytics can assume to access the stream on your behalf. You need to grant the necessary permissions to this role.

          

        
      
      - **KinesisFirehoseInput** *(dict) --* 

        If the streaming source is an Amazon Kinesis Firehose delivery stream, identifies the delivery stream's ARN and an IAM role that enables Amazon Kinesis Analytics to access the stream on your behalf.

         

        Note: Either ``KinesisStreamsInput`` or ``KinesisFirehoseInput`` is required.

        

      
        - **ResourceARN** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          ARN of the input delivery stream.
