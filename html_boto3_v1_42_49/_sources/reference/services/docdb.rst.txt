.. py:class:: DocDB.Client

  A low-level client representing Amazon DocumentDB with MongoDB compatibility (DocDB)
  

  Amazon DocumentDB is a fast, reliable, and fully managed database service. Amazon DocumentDB makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale MongoDB-compatible databases in the cloud. With Amazon DocumentDB, you can run the same application code and use the same drivers and tools that you use with MongoDB.

  ::

    
    import boto3
    
    client = boto3.client('docdb')
