.. py:method:: VPCLattice.Client.create_rule(**kwargs)

  

  Creates a listener rule. Each listener has a default rule for checking connection requests, but you can define additional rules. Each rule consists of a priority, one or more actions, and one or more conditions. For more information, see `Listener rules <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc-lattice/latest/ug/listeners.html#listener-rules>`__ in the *Amazon VPC Lattice User Guide*.

  :type priority: integer
  :param priority: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The priority assigned to the rule. Each rule for a specific listener must have a unique priority. The lower the priority number the higher the priority.

    

  
  :type action: dict
  :param action: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The action for the default rule.

    .. note::    This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the     following top level keys can be set: ``forward``, ``fixedResponse``. 

  
    - **forward** *(dict) --* 

      The forward action. Traffic that matches the rule is forwarded to the specified target groups.

      

    
      - **targetGroups** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The target groups. Traffic matching the rule is forwarded to the specified target groups. With forward actions, you can assign a weight that controls the prioritization and selection of each target group. This means that requests are distributed to individual target groups based on their weights. For example, if two target groups have the same weight, each target group receives half of the traffic.

         

        The default value is 1. This means that if only one target group is provided, there is no need to set the weight; 100% of the traffic goes to that target group.

        

      
        - *(dict) --* 

          Describes the weight of a target group.

          

        
          - **targetGroupIdentifier** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]**

          - **weight** *(integer) --* 

            Only required if you specify multiple target groups for a forward action. The weight determines how requests are distributed to the target group. For example, if you specify two target groups, each with a weight of 10, each target group receives half the requests. If you specify two target groups, one with a weight of 10 and the other with a weight of 20, the target group with a weight of 20 receives twice as many requests as the other target group. If there's only one target group specified, then the default value is 100.

            

          
        
    
    
    - **fixedResponse** *(dict) --* 

      The fixed response action. The rule returns a custom HTTP response.

      

    
      - **statusCode** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The HTTP response code. Only ``404`` and ``500`` status codes are supported.

        

      
    
  
  :type clientToken: string
  :param clientToken: 

    A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency of the request. If you retry a request that completed successfully using the same client token and parameters, the retry succeeds without performing any actions. If the parameters aren't identical, the retry fails.

    This field is autopopulated if not provided.

  
  :type tags: dict
  :param tags: 

    The tags for the rule.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

      The key of the tag.

       

      Constraints: Tag keys are case-sensitive and accept a maximum of 128 Unicode characters. Valid characters are Unicode letters, digits, white space, and any of the following symbols: _ . : / = + - @ May not begin with ``aws:``.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

        The value of the tag.

         

        Constraints: Tag values are case-sensitive and accept a maximum of 256 Unicode characters. Valid characters are Unicode letters, digits, white space, and any of the following symbols: _ . : / = + - @

If you specify two target groups, one with a weight of 10 and the other with a weight of 20, the target group with a weight of 20 receives twice as many requests as the other target group.
