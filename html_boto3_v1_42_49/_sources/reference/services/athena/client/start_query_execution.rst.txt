.. py:method:: Athena.Client.start_query_execution(**kwargs)

  

  Runs the SQL query statements contained in the ``Query``. Requires you to have access to the workgroup in which the query ran. Running queries against an external catalog requires  GetDataCatalog permission to the catalog. For code samples using the Amazon Web Services SDK for Java, see `Examples and Code Samples <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/code-samples.html>`__ in the *Amazon Athena User Guide*.

        }
    )
    
  :type QueryString: string
  :param QueryString: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The SQL query statements to be executed.

    

  
  :type ClientRequestToken: string
  :param ClientRequestToken: 

    A unique case-sensitive string used to ensure the request to create the query is idempotent (executes only once). If another ``StartQueryExecution`` request is received, the same response is returned and another query is not created. An error is returned if a parameter, such as ``QueryString``, has changed. A call to ``StartQueryExecution`` that uses a previous client request token returns the same ``QueryExecutionId`` even if the requester doesn't have permission on the tables specified in ``QueryString``.

     

    .. warning::

       

      This token is listed as not required because Amazon Web Services SDKs (for example the Amazon Web Services SDK for Java) auto-generate the token for users. If you are not using the Amazon Web Services SDK or the Amazon Web Services CLI, you must provide this token or the action will fail.

      

    This field is autopopulated if not provided.

  
  :type QueryExecutionContext: dict
  :param QueryExecutionContext: 

    The database within which the query executes.

    

  
    - **Database** *(string) --* 

      The name of the database used in the query execution. The database must exist in the catalog.

      

    
    - **Catalog** *(string) --* 

      The name of the data catalog used in the query execution.

      

    
  
  :type ResultConfiguration: dict
  :param ResultConfiguration: 

    Specifies information about where and how to save the results of the query execution. If the query runs in a workgroup, then workgroup's settings may override query settings. This affects the query results location. The workgroup settings override is specified in EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration (true/false) in the WorkGroupConfiguration. See  WorkGroupConfiguration$EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration.

    

  
    - **OutputLocation** *(string) --* 

      The location in Amazon S3 where your query and calculation results are stored, such as ``s3://path/to/query/bucket/``. To run the query, you must specify the query results location using one of the ways: either for individual queries using either this setting (client-side), or in the workgroup, using  WorkGroupConfiguration. If none of them is set, Athena issues an error that no output location is provided. If workgroup settings override client-side settings, then the query uses the settings specified for the workgroup. See  WorkGroupConfiguration$EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration.

      

    
    - **EncryptionConfiguration** *(dict) --* 

      If query and calculation results are encrypted in Amazon S3, indicates the encryption option used (for example, ``SSE_KMS`` or ``CSE_KMS``) and key information. This is a client-side setting. If workgroup settings override client-side settings, then the query uses the encryption configuration that is specified for the workgroup, and also uses the location for storing query results specified in the workgroup. See  WorkGroupConfiguration$EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration and `Workgroup Settings Override Client-Side Settings <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/workgroups-settings-override.html>`__.

      

    
      - **EncryptionOption** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        Indicates whether Amazon S3 server-side encryption with Amazon S3-managed keys ( ``SSE_S3``), server-side encryption with KMS-managed keys ( ``SSE_KMS``), or client-side encryption with KMS-managed keys ( ``CSE_KMS``) is used.

         

        If a query runs in a workgroup and the workgroup overrides client-side settings, then the workgroup's setting for encryption is used. It specifies whether query results must be encrypted, for all queries that run in this workgroup.

        

      
      - **KmsKey** *(string) --* 

        For ``SSE_KMS`` and ``CSE_KMS``, this is the KMS key ARN or ID.

        

      
    
    - **ExpectedBucketOwner** *(string) --* 

      The Amazon Web Services account ID that you expect to be the owner of the Amazon S3 bucket specified by  ResultConfiguration$OutputLocation. If set, Athena uses the value for ``ExpectedBucketOwner`` when it makes Amazon S3 calls to your specified output location. If the ``ExpectedBucketOwner`` Amazon Web Services account ID does not match the actual owner of the Amazon S3 bucket, the call fails with a permissions error.

       

      This is a client-side setting. If workgroup settings override client-side settings, then the query uses the ``ExpectedBucketOwner`` setting that is specified for the workgroup, and also uses the location for storing query results specified in the workgroup. See  WorkGroupConfiguration$EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration and `Workgroup Settings Override Client-Side Settings <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/workgroups-settings-override.html>`__.

      

    
    - **AclConfiguration** *(dict) --* 

      Indicates that an Amazon S3 canned ACL should be set to control ownership of stored query results. Currently the only supported canned ACL is ``BUCKET_OWNER_FULL_CONTROL``. This is a client-side setting. If workgroup settings override client-side settings, then the query uses the ACL configuration that is specified for the workgroup, and also uses the location for storing query results specified in the workgroup. For more information, see  WorkGroupConfiguration$EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration and `Workgroup Settings Override Client-Side Settings <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/workgroups-settings-override.html>`__.

      

    
      - **S3AclOption** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The Amazon S3 canned ACL that Athena should specify when storing query results, including data files inserted by Athena as the result of statements like CTAS or INSERT INTO. Currently the only supported canned ACL is ``BUCKET_OWNER_FULL_CONTROL``. If a query runs in a workgroup and the workgroup overrides client-side settings, then the Amazon S3 canned ACL specified in the workgroup's settings is used for all queries that run in the workgroup. For more information about Amazon S3 canned ACLs, see `Canned ACL <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl-overview.html#canned-acl>`__ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

        

      
    
  
  :type WorkGroup: string
  :param WorkGroup: 

    The name of the workgroup in which the query is being started.

    

  
  :type ExecutionParameters: list
  :param ExecutionParameters: 

    A list of values for the parameters in a query. The values are applied sequentially to the parameters in the query in the order in which the parameters occur.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type ResultReuseConfiguration: dict
  :param ResultReuseConfiguration: 

    Specifies the query result reuse behavior for the query.

    

  
    - **ResultReuseByAgeConfiguration** *(dict) --* 

      Specifies whether previous query results are reused, and if so, their maximum age.

      

    
      - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        True if previous query results can be reused when the query is run; otherwise, false. The default is false.

        

      
      - **MaxAgeInMinutes** *(integer) --* 

        Specifies, in minutes, the maximum age of a previous query result that Athena should consider for reuse. The default is 60.

        

      
    
  
  :type EngineConfiguration: dict
  :param EngineConfiguration: 

    The engine configuration for the workgroup, which includes the minimum/maximum number of Data Processing Units (DPU) that queries should use when running in provisioned capacity. If not specified, Athena uses default values (Default value for min is 4 and for max is Minimum of 124 and allocated DPUs).

     

    To specify minimum and maximum DPU values for Capacity Reservations queries, the workgroup containing ``EngineConfiguration`` should have the following values: The name of the ``Classifications`` should be ``athena-query-engine-properties``, with the only allowed properties as ``max-dpu-count`` and ``min-dpu-count``.

    

  
    - **CoordinatorDpuSize** *(integer) --* 

      The number of DPUs to use for the coordinator. A coordinator is a special executor that orchestrates processing work and manages other executors in a notebook session. The default is 1.

      

    
    - **MaxConcurrentDpus** *(integer) --* 

      The maximum number of DPUs that can run concurrently.

      

    
    - **DefaultExecutorDpuSize** *(integer) --* 

      The default number of DPUs to use for executors. An executor is the smallest unit of compute that a notebook session can request from Athena. The default is 1.

      

    
    - **AdditionalConfigs** *(dict) --* 

      Contains additional notebook engine ``MAP<string, string>`` parameter mappings in the form of key-value pairs. To specify an Athena notebook that the Jupyter server will download and serve, specify a value for the  StartSessionRequest$NotebookVersion field, and then add a key named ``NotebookId`` to ``AdditionalConfigs`` that has the value of the Athena notebook ID.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
  

    - **SparkProperties** *(dict) --* 

      Specifies custom jar files and Spark properties for use cases like cluster encryption, table formats, and general Spark tuning.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
  

    - **Classifications** *(list) --* 

      The configuration classifications that can be specified for the engine.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        A classification refers to a set of specific configurations.

        

      
        - **Name** *(string) --*
