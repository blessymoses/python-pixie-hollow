    response = client.list_engine_versions(
        NextToken='string',
        MaxResults=123
    )
    
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    A token generated by the Athena service that specifies where to continue pagination if a previous request was truncated. To obtain the next set of pages, pass in the ``NextToken`` from the response object of the previous page call.

    

  
  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    The maximum number of engine versions to return in this request.

    **Response Syntax**

    
    ::

      {
          'EngineVersions': [
              {
                  'SelectedEngineVersion': 'string',
                  'EffectiveEngineVersion': 'string'

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **EngineVersions** *(list) --* 

        A list of engine versions that are available to choose from.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          The Athena engine version for running queries, or the PySpark engine version for running sessions.

          
          

          - **SelectedEngineVersion** *(string) --* 

            The engine version requested by the user. Possible values are determined by the output of ``ListEngineVersions``, including AUTO. The default is AUTO.

            
          

          - **EffectiveEngineVersion** *(string) --* 

            Read only. The engine version on which the query runs. If the user requests a valid engine version other than Auto, the effective engine version is the same as the engine version that the user requested. If the user requests Auto, the effective engine version is chosen by Athena. When a request to update the engine version is made by a ``CreateWorkGroup`` or ``UpdateWorkGroup`` operation, the ``EffectiveEngineVersion`` field is ignored.

            
      
    
      

      - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

        A token generated by the Athena service that specifies where to continue pagination if a previous request was truncated. To obtain the next set of pages, pass in the ``NextToken`` from the response object of the previous page call.
