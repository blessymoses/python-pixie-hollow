.. py:method:: Athena.Client.stop_calculation_execution(**kwargs)

  

  Requests the cancellation of a calculation. A ``StopCalculationExecution`` call on a calculation that is already in a terminal state (for example, ``STOPPED``, ``FAILED``, or ``COMPLETED``) succeeds but has no effect.

   

  .. note::

    

    Cancelling a calculation is done on a best effort basis. If a calculation cannot be cancelled, you can be charged for its completion. If you are concerned about being charged for a calculation that cannot be cancelled, consider terminating the session in which the calculation is running.
