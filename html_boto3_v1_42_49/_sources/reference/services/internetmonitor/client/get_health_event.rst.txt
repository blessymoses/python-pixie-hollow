.. py:method:: CloudWatchInternetMonitor.Client.get_health_event(**kwargs)

  

  Gets information that Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor has created and stored about a health event for a specified monitor. This information includes the impacted locations, and all the information related to the event, by location.

   

  The information returned includes the impact on performance, availability, and round-trip time, information about the network providers (ASNs), the event type, and so on.

   

  Information rolled up at the global traffic level is also returned, including the impact type and total traffic impact.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.get_health_event(
        MonitorName='string',
        EventId='string',
        LinkedAccountId='string'
    )
    
  :type MonitorName: string
  :param MonitorName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of the monitor.

    

  
  :type EventId: string
  :param EventId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The internally-generated identifier of a health event. Because ``EventID`` contains the forward slash (“/”) character, you must URL-encode the ``EventID`` field in the request URL.

    

  
  :type LinkedAccountId: string
  :param LinkedAccountId: 

    The account ID for an account that you've set up cross-account sharing for in Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor. You configure cross-account sharing by using Amazon CloudWatch Observability Access Manager. For more information, see `Internet Monitor cross-account observability <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/cwim-cross-account.html>`__ in the Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor User Guide.
