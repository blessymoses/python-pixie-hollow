.. py:method:: CloudWatchInternetMonitor.Client.start_query(**kwargs)

  

  Start a query to return data for a specific query type for the Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor query interface. Specify a time period for the data that you want returned by using ``StartTime`` and ``EndTime``. You filter the query results to return by providing parameters that you specify with ``FilterParameters``.

   

  For more information about using the query interface, including examples, see `Using the Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor query interface <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-IM-view-cw-tools-cwim-query.html>`__ in the Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor User Guide.

  :type MonitorName: string
  :param MonitorName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of the monitor to query.

    

  
  :type StartTime: datetime
  :param StartTime: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The timestamp that is the beginning of the period that you want to retrieve data for with your query.

    

  
  :type EndTime: datetime
  :param EndTime: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The timestamp that is the end of the period that you want to retrieve data for with your query.

    

  
  :type QueryType: string
  :param QueryType: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The type of query to run. The following are the three types of queries that you can run using the Internet Monitor query interface:

     

    
    * ``MEASUREMENTS``: Provides availability score, performance score, total traffic, and round-trip times, at 5 minute intervals.
     
    * ``TOP_LOCATIONS``: Provides availability score, performance score, total traffic, and time to first byte (TTFB) information, for the top location and ASN combinations that you're monitoring, by traffic volume.
     
    * ``TOP_LOCATION_DETAILS``: Provides TTFB for Amazon CloudFront, your current configuration, and the best performing EC2 configuration, at 1 hour intervals.
     
    * ``OVERALL_TRAFFIC_SUGGESTIONS``: Provides TTFB, using a 30-day weighted average, for all traffic in each Amazon Web Services location that is monitored.
     
    * ``OVERALL_TRAFFIC_SUGGESTIONS_DETAILS``: Provides TTFB, using a 30-day weighted average, for each top location, for a proposed Amazon Web Services location. Must provide an Amazon Web Services location to search.
     
    * ``ROUTING_SUGGESTIONS``: Provides the predicted average round-trip time (RTT) from an IP prefix toward an Amazon Web Services location for a DNS resolver. The RTT is calculated at one hour intervals, over a one hour period.
    

     

    For lists of the fields returned with each query type and more information about how each type of query is performed, see `Using the Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor query interface <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-IM-view-cw-tools-cwim-query.html>`__ in the Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor User Guide.

    

  
  :type FilterParameters: list
  :param FilterParameters: 

    The ``FilterParameters`` field that you use with Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor queries is a string the defines how you want a query to be filtered. The filter parameters that you can specify depend on the query type, since each query type returns a different set of Internet Monitor data.

     

    For more information about specifying filter parameters, see `Using the Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor query interface <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-IM-view-cw-tools-cwim-query.html>`__ in the Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor User Guide.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      A filter that you use with the results of a Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor query that you created and ran. The query sets up a repository of data that is a subset of your application's Internet Monitor data. ``FilterParameter`` is a string that defines how you want to filter the repository of data to return a set of results, based on your criteria.

       

      The filter parameters that you can specify depend on the query type that you used to create the repository, since each query type returns a different set of Internet Monitor data.

       

      For each filter, you specify a field (such as ``city``), an operator (such as ``not_equals``, and a value or array of values (such as ``["Seattle", "Redmond"]``). Separate values in the array with commas.

       

      For more information about specifying filter parameters, see `Using the Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor query interface <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-IM-view-cw-tools-cwim-query.html>`__ in the Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor User Guide.

      

    
      - **Field** *(string) --* 

        A data field that you want to filter, to further scope your application's Internet Monitor data in a repository that you created by running a query. A field might be ``city``, for example. The field must be one of the fields that was returned by the specific query that you used to create the repository.

        

      
      - **Operator** *(string) --* 

        The operator to use with the filter field and a value, such as ``not_equals``.

        

      
      - **Values** *(list) --* 

        One or more values to be used, together with the specified operator, to filter data for a query. For example, you could specify an array of values such as ``["Seattle", "Redmond"]``. Values in the array are separated by commas.

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
    
    

  :type LinkedAccountId: string
  :param LinkedAccountId: 

    The account ID for an account that you've set up cross-account sharing for in Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor. You configure cross-account sharing by using Amazon CloudWatch Observability Access Manager. For more information, see `Internet Monitor cross-account observability <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/cwim-cross-account.html>`__ in the Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor User Guide.
