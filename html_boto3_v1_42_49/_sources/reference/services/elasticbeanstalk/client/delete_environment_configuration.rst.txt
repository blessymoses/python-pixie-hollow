.. py:method:: ElasticBeanstalk.Client.delete_environment_configuration(**kwargs)

  

  Deletes the draft configuration associated with the running environment.

   

  Updating a running environment with any configuration changes creates a draft configuration set. You can get the draft configuration using  DescribeConfigurationSettings while the update is in progress or if the update fails. The ``DeploymentStatus`` for the draft configuration indicates whether the deployment is in process or has failed. The draft configuration remains in existence until it is deleted with this action.
