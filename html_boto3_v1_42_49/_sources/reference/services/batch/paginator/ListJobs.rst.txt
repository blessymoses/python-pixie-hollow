          }
      )
      
    :type jobQueue: string
    :param jobQueue: 

      The name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the job queue used to list jobs.

      

    
    :type arrayJobId: string
    :param arrayJobId: 

      The job ID for an array job. Specifying an array job ID with this parameter lists all child jobs from within the specified array.

      

    
    :type multiNodeJobId: string
    :param multiNodeJobId: 

      The job ID for a multi-node parallel job. Specifying a multi-node parallel job ID with this parameter lists all nodes that are associated with the specified job.

      

    
    :type jobStatus: string
    :param jobStatus: 

      The job status used to filter jobs in the specified queue. If the ``filters`` parameter is specified, the ``jobStatus`` parameter is ignored and jobs with any status are returned. The exception is the ``SHARE_IDENTIFIER`` filter and ``jobStatus`` can be used together. If you don't specify a status, only ``RUNNING`` jobs are returned.

       

      .. note::

        

        Array job parents are updated to ``PENDING`` when any child job is updated to ``RUNNABLE`` and remain in ``PENDING`` status while child jobs are running. To view these jobs, filter by ``PENDING`` status until all child jobs reach a terminal state.

        

      

    
    :type filters: list
    :param filters: 

      The filter to apply to the query. Only one filter can be used at a time. When the filter is used, ``jobStatus`` is ignored with the exception that ``SHARE_IDENTIFIER`` and ``jobStatus`` can be used together. The filter doesn't apply to child jobs in an array or multi-node parallel (MNP) jobs. The results are sorted by the ``createdAt`` field, with the most recent jobs being first.

       

      .. note::

        

        The ``SHARE_IDENTIFIER`` filter and the ``jobStatus`` field can be used together to filter results.

        

        JOB_NAME  

      The value of the filter is a case-insensitive match for the job name. If the value ends with an asterisk (*), the filter matches any job name that begins with the string before the '*'. This corresponds to the ``jobName`` value. For example, ``test1`` matches both ``Test1`` and ``test1``, and ``test1*`` matches both ``test1`` and ``Test10``. When the ``JOB_NAME`` filter is used, the results are grouped by the job name and version.

        JOB_DEFINITION  

      The value for the filter is the name or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the job definition. This corresponds to the ``jobDefinition`` value. The value is case sensitive. When the value for the filter is the job definition name, the results include all the jobs that used any revision of that job definition name. If the value ends with an asterisk (*), the filter matches any job definition name that begins with the string before the '*'. For example, ``jd1`` matches only ``jd1``, and ``jd1*`` matches both ``jd1`` and ``jd1A``. The version of the job definition that's used doesn't affect the sort order. When the ``JOB_DEFINITION`` filter is used and the ARN is used (which is in the form ``arn:${Partition}:batch:${Region}:${Account}:job-definition/${JobDefinitionName}:${Revision}``), the results include jobs that used the specified revision of the job definition. Asterisk (*) isn't supported when the ARN is used.

        BEFORE_CREATED_AT  

      The value for the filter is the time that's before the job was created. This corresponds to the ``createdAt`` value. The value is a string representation of the number of milliseconds since 00:00:00 UTC (midnight) on January 1, 1970.

        AFTER_CREATED_AT  

      The value for the filter is the time that's after the job was created. This corresponds to the ``createdAt`` value. The value is a string representation of the number of milliseconds since 00:00:00 UTC (midnight) on January 1, 1970.

        SHARE_IDENTIFIER  

      The value for the filter is the fairshare scheduling share identifier.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        A filter name and value pair that's used to return a more specific list of results from a ``ListJobs`` or ``ListJobsByConsumableResource`` API operation.

        

      
        - **name** *(string) --* 

          The name of the filter. Filter names are case sensitive.

          

        
        - **values** *(list) --* 

          The filter values.

          

        
          - *(string) --* 

          
      
      
  
    :type PaginationConfig: dict
    :param PaginationConfig: 

      A dictionary that provides parameters to control pagination.

      

    
      - **MaxItems** *(integer) --* 

        The total number of items to return. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified in max-items then a ``NextToken`` will be provided in the output that you can use to resume pagination.

        

      
      - **PageSize** *(integer) --* 

        The size of each page.

        

      
      - **StartingToken** *(string) --* 

        A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previous response.
