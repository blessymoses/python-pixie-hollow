  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.update_service_environment(
        serviceEnvironment='string',
        state='ENABLED'|'DISABLED',
        capacityLimits=[
            {
                'maxCapacity': 123,
                'capacityUnit': 'string'
            },
        ]
    )
    
  :type serviceEnvironment: string
  :param serviceEnvironment: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name or ARN of the service environment to update.

    

  
  :type state: string
  :param state: 

    The state of the service environment.

    

  
  :type capacityLimits: list
  :param capacityLimits: 

    The capacity limits for the service environment. This defines the maximum resources that can be used by service jobs in this environment.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      Defines the capacity limit for a service environment. This structure specifies the maximum amount of resources that can be used by service jobs in the environment.

      

    
      - **maxCapacity** *(integer) --* 

        The maximum capacity available for the service environment. This value represents the maximum amount of resources that can be allocated to service jobs.

         

        For example, ``maxCapacity=50``, ``capacityUnit=NUM_INSTANCES``. This indicates that the maximum number of instances that can be run on this service environment is 50. You could then run 5 SageMaker Training jobs that each use 10 instances. However, if you submit another job that requires 10 instances, it will wait in the queue.

        

      
      - **capacityUnit** *(string) --* 

        The unit of measure for the capacity limit. This defines how the maxCapacity value should be interpreted. For ``SAGEMAKER_TRAINING`` jobs, use ``NUM_INSTANCES``.
