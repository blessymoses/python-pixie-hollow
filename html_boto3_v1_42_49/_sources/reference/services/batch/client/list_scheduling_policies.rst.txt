  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_scheduling_policies(
        maxResults=123,
        nextToken='string'
    )
    
  :type maxResults: integer
  :param maxResults: 

    The maximum number of results that's returned by ``ListSchedulingPolicies`` in paginated output. When this parameter is used, ``ListSchedulingPolicies`` only returns ``maxResults`` results in a single page and a ``nextToken`` response element. You can see the remaining results of the initial request by sending another ``ListSchedulingPolicies`` request with the returned ``nextToken`` value. This value can be between 1 and 100. If this parameter isn't used, ``ListSchedulingPolicies`` returns up to 100 results and a ``nextToken`` value if applicable.

    

  
  :type nextToken: string
  :param nextToken: 

    The ``nextToken`` value that's returned from a previous paginated ``ListSchedulingPolicies`` request where ``maxResults`` was used and the results exceeded the value of that parameter. Pagination continues from the end of the previous results that returned the ``nextToken`` value. This value is ``null`` when there are no more results to return.

     

    .. note::

      

      Treat this token as an opaque identifier that's only used to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other programmatic purposes.

            Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the scheduling policy.

            
      
    
      

      - **nextToken** *(string) --* 

        The ``nextToken`` value to include in a future ``ListSchedulingPolicies`` request. When the results of a ``ListSchedulingPolicies`` request exceed ``maxResults``, this value can be used to retrieve the next page of results. This value is ``null`` when there are no more results to return.
