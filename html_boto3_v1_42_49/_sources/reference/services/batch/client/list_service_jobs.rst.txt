  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_service_jobs(
        jobQueue='string',
        jobStatus='SUBMITTED'|'PENDING'|'RUNNABLE'|'SCHEDULED'|'STARTING'|'RUNNING'|'SUCCEEDED'|'FAILED',
        maxResults=123,
        nextToken='string',
        filters=[
            {
                'name': 'string',
                'values': [
                    'string',
                ]
            },
        ]
    )
    
  :type jobQueue: string
  :param jobQueue: 

    The name or ARN of the job queue with which to list service jobs.

    

  
  :type jobStatus: string
  :param jobStatus: 

    The job status used to filter service jobs in the specified queue. If the ``filters`` parameter is specified, the ``jobStatus`` parameter is ignored and jobs with any status are returned. The exception is the ``SHARE_IDENTIFIER`` filter and ``jobStatus`` can be used together. If you don't specify a status, only ``RUNNING`` jobs are returned.

     

    .. note::

      

      The ``SHARE_IDENTIFIER`` filter and the ``jobStatus`` field can be used together to filter results.

      

    

  
  :type maxResults: integer
  :param maxResults: 

    The maximum number of results returned by ``ListServiceJobs`` in paginated output. When this parameter is used, ``ListServiceJobs`` only returns ``maxResults`` results in a single page and a ``nextToken`` response element. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another ``ListServiceJobs`` request with the returned ``nextToken`` value. This value can be between 1 and 100. If this parameter isn't used, then ``ListServiceJobs`` returns up to 100 results and a ``nextToken`` value if applicable.

    

  
  :type nextToken: string
  :param nextToken: 

    The ``nextToken`` value returned from a previous paginated ``ListServiceJobs`` request where ``maxResults`` was used and the results exceeded the value of that parameter. Pagination continues from the end of the previous results that returned the ``nextToken`` value. This value is ``null`` when there are no more results to return.

     

    .. note::

      

      Treat this token as an opaque identifier that's only used to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other programmatic purposes.

      

    

  
  :type filters: list
  :param filters: 

    The filter to apply to the query. Only one filter can be used at a time. When the filter is used, ``jobStatus`` is ignored with the exception that ``SHARE_IDENTIFIER`` and ``jobStatus`` can be used together. The results are sorted by the ``createdAt`` field, with the most recent jobs being first.

     

    .. note::

      

      The ``SHARE_IDENTIFIER`` filter and the ``jobStatus`` field can be used together to filter results.

      

      JOB_NAME  

    The value of the filter is a case-insensitive match for the job name. If the value ends with an asterisk (*), the filter matches any job name that begins with the string before the '*'. This corresponds to the ``jobName`` value. For example, ``test1`` matches both ``Test1`` and ``test1``, and ``test1*`` matches both ``test1`` and ``Test10``. When the ``JOB_NAME`` filter is used, the results are grouped by the job name and version.

      BEFORE_CREATED_AT  

    The value for the filter is the time that's before the job was created. This corresponds to the ``createdAt`` value. The value is a string representation of the number of milliseconds since 00:00:00 UTC (midnight) on January 1, 1970.

      AFTER_CREATED_AT  

    The value for the filter is the time that's after the job was created. This corresponds to the ``createdAt`` value. The value is a string representation of the number of milliseconds since 00:00:00 UTC (midnight) on January 1, 1970.

      SHARE_IDENTIFIER  

    The value for the filter is the fairshare scheduling share identifier.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      A filter name and value pair that's used to return a more specific list of results from a ``ListJobs`` or ``ListJobsByConsumableResource`` API operation.

      

    
      - **name** *(string) --* 

        The name of the filter. Filter names are case sensitive.

        

      
      - **values** *(list) --* 

        The filter values.
