  :type computeEnvironment: string
  :param computeEnvironment: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the compute environment to update.

    

  
  :type state: string
  :param state: 

    The state of the compute environment. Compute environments in the ``ENABLED`` state can accept jobs from a queue and scale in or out automatically based on the workload demand of its associated queues.

     

    If the state is ``ENABLED``, then the Batch scheduler can attempt to place jobs from an associated job queue on the compute resources within the environment. If the compute environment is managed, then it can scale its instances out or in automatically, based on the job queue demand.

     

    If the state is ``DISABLED``, then the Batch scheduler doesn't attempt to place jobs within the environment. Jobs in a ``STARTING`` or ``RUNNING`` state continue to progress normally. Managed compute environments in the ``DISABLED`` state don't scale out.

     

    .. note::

      

      Compute environments in a ``DISABLED`` state may continue to incur billing charges. To prevent additional charges, turn off and then delete the compute environment. For more information, see `State <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/compute_environment_parameters.html#compute_environment_state>`__ in the *Batch User Guide*.

      

     

    When an instance is idle, the instance scales down to the ``minvCpus`` value. However, the instance size doesn't change. For example, consider a ``c5.8xlarge`` instance with a ``minvCpus`` value of ``4`` and a ``desiredvCpus`` value of ``36``. This instance doesn't scale down to a ``c5.large`` instance.

    

  
  :type unmanagedvCpus: integer
  :param unmanagedvCpus: 

    The maximum number of vCPUs expected to be used for an unmanaged compute environment. Don't specify this parameter for a managed compute environment. This parameter is only used for fair-share scheduling to reserve vCPU capacity for new share identifiers. If this parameter isn't provided for a fair-share job queue, no vCPU capacity is reserved.

    

  
  :type computeResources: dict
  :param computeResources: 

    Details of the compute resources managed by the compute environment. Required for a managed compute environment. For more information, see `Compute Environments <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/compute_environments.html>`__ in the *Batch User Guide*.

    

  
    - **minvCpus** *(integer) --* 

      The minimum number of vCPUs that an environment should maintain (even if the compute environment is ``DISABLED``).

       

      .. note::

        

        This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources. Don't specify it.

        

      

    
    - **maxvCpus** *(integer) --* 

      The maximum number of Amazon EC2 vCPUs that an environment can reach.

       

      .. note::

        

        With ``BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE``, ``SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED`` and ``SPOT_PRICE_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED`` (recommended) strategies using On-Demand or Spot Instances, and the ``BEST_FIT`` strategy using Spot Instances, Batch might need to exceed ``maxvCpus`` to meet your capacity requirements. In this event, Batch never exceeds ``maxvCpus`` by more than a single instance.

        

      

    
    - **desiredvCpus** *(integer) --* 

      The desired number of vCPUS in the compute environment. Batch modifies this value between the minimum and maximum values based on job queue demand.

       

      .. note::

        

        This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources. Don't specify it.

        

       

      .. note::

        

        Batch doesn't support changing the desired number of vCPUs of an existing compute environment. Don't specify this parameter for compute environments using Amazon EKS clusters.

        

       

      .. note::

        

        When you update the ``desiredvCpus`` setting, the value must be between the ``minvCpus`` and ``maxvCpus`` values.

         

        Additionally, the updated ``desiredvCpus`` value must be greater than or equal to the current ``desiredvCpus`` value. For more information, see `Troubleshooting Batch <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/troubleshooting.html#error-desired-vcpus-update>`__ in the *Batch User Guide*.

        

      

    
    - **subnets** *(list) --* 

      The VPC subnets where the compute resources are launched. Fargate compute resources can contain up to 16 subnets. For Fargate compute resources, providing an empty list will be handled as if this parameter wasn't specified and no change is made. For Amazon EC2 compute resources, providing an empty list removes the VPC subnets from the compute resource. For more information, see `VPCs and subnets <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Subnets.html>`__ in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*.

       

      When updating a compute environment, changing the VPC subnets requires an infrastructure update of the compute environment. For more information, see `Updating compute environments <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html>`__ in the *Batch User Guide*.

       

      .. note::

        

        Batch on Amazon EC2 and Batch on Amazon EKS support Local Zones. For more information, see `Local Zones <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html#concepts-local-zones>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*, `Amazon EKS and Amazon Web Services Local Zones <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/local-zones.html>`__ in the *Amazon EKS User Guide* and `Amazon ECS clusters in Local Zones, Wavelength Zones, and Amazon Web Services Outposts <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/cluster-regions-zones.html#clusters-local-zones>`__ in the *Amazon ECS Developer Guide*.

         

        Batch on Fargate doesn't currently support Local Zones.

        

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    - **securityGroupIds** *(list) --* 

      The Amazon EC2 security groups that are associated with instances launched in the compute environment. This parameter is required for Fargate compute resources, where it can contain up to 5 security groups. For Fargate compute resources, providing an empty list is handled as if this parameter wasn't specified and no change is made. For Amazon EC2 compute resources, providing an empty list removes the security groups from the compute resource.

       

      When updating a compute environment, changing the Amazon EC2 security groups requires an infrastructure update of the compute environment. For more information, see `Updating compute environments <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html>`__ in the *Batch User Guide*.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    - **allocationStrategy** *(string) --* 

      The allocation strategy to use for the compute resource if there's not enough instances of the best fitting instance type that can be allocated. This might be because of availability of the instance type in the Region or `Amazon EC2 service limits <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-resource-limits.html>`__. For more information, see `Allocation strategies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/allocation-strategies.html>`__ in the *Batch User Guide*.

       

      When updating a compute environment, changing the allocation strategy requires an infrastructure update of the compute environment. For more information, see `Updating compute environments <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html>`__ in the *Batch User Guide*. ``BEST_FIT`` isn't supported when updating a compute environment.

       

      .. note::

        

        This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources. Don't specify it.

        

        BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE  

      Batch selects additional instance types that are large enough to meet the requirements of the jobs in the queue. Its preference is for instance types with lower cost vCPUs. If additional instances of the previously selected instance types aren't available, Batch selects new instance types.

        SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED  

      Batch selects one or more instance types that are large enough to meet the requirements of the jobs in the queue. Its preference is for instance types that are less likely to be interrupted. This allocation strategy is only available for Spot Instance compute resources.

        SPOT_PRICE_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED  

      The price and capacity optimized allocation strategy looks at both price and capacity to select the Spot Instance pools that are the least likely to be interrupted and have the lowest possible price. This allocation strategy is only available for Spot Instance compute resources.

         

      With ``BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE``, ``SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED`` and ``SPOT_PRICE_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED`` (recommended) strategies using On-Demand or Spot Instances, and the ``BEST_FIT`` strategy using Spot Instances, Batch might need to exceed ``maxvCpus`` to meet your capacity requirements. In this event, Batch never exceeds ``maxvCpus`` by more than a single instance.

      

    
    - **instanceTypes** *(list) --* 

      The instances types that can be launched. You can specify instance families to launch any instance type within those families (for example, ``c5`` or ``p3``), or you can specify specific sizes within a family (such as ``c5.8xlarge``).

       

      Batch can select the instance type for you if you choose one of the following:

       

      
      * ``optimal`` to select instance types (from the ``c4``, ``m4``, ``r4``, ``c5``, ``m5``, and ``r5`` instance families) that match the demand of your job queues.
       
      * ``default_x86_64`` to choose x86 based instance types (from the ``m6i``, ``c6i``, ``r6i``, and ``c7i`` instance families) that matches the resource demands of the job queue.
       
      * ``default_arm64`` to choose x86 based instance types (from the ``m6g``, ``c6g``, ``r6g``, and ``c7g`` instance families) that matches the resource demands of the job queue.
      

       

      .. note::

        

        Starting on 11/01/2025 the behavior of ``optimal`` is going to be changed to match ``default_x86_64``. During the change your instance families could be updated to a newer generation. You do not need to perform any actions for the upgrade to happen. For more information about change, see `Optimal instance type configuration to receive automatic instance family updates <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/optimal-default-instance-troubleshooting.html>`__.

        

       

      .. note::

        

        Instance family availability varies by Amazon Web Services Region. For example, some Amazon Web Services Regions may not have any fourth generation instance families but have fifth and sixth generation instance families.

         

        When using ``default_x86_64`` or ``default_arm64`` instance bundles, Batch selects instance families based on a balance of cost-effectiveness and performance. While newer generation instances often provide better price-performance, Batch may choose an earlier generation instance family if it provides the optimal combination of availability, cost, and performance for your workload. For example, in an Amazon Web Services Region where both c6i and c7i instances are available, Batch might select c6i instances if they offer better cost-effectiveness for your specific job requirements. For more information on Batch instance types and Amazon Web Services Region availability, see `Instance type compute table <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/instance-type-compute-table.html>`__ in the *Batch User Guide*.

         

        Batch periodically updates your instances in default bundles to newer, more cost-effective options. Updates happen automatically without requiring any action from you. Your workloads continue running during updates with no interruption

        

       

      .. note::

        

        This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources. Don't specify it.

        

       

      .. note::

        

        When you create a compute environment, the instance types that you select for the compute environment must share the same architecture. For example, you can't mix x86 and ARM instances in the same compute environment.

        

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    - **ec2KeyPair** *(string) --* 

      The Amazon EC2 key pair that's used for instances launched in the compute environment. You can use this key pair to log in to your instances with SSH. To remove the Amazon EC2 key pair, set this value to an empty string.

       

      When updating a compute environment, changing the Amazon EC2 key pair requires an infrastructure update of the compute environment. For more information, see `Updating compute environments <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html>`__ in the *Batch User Guide*.

       

      .. note::

        

        This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources. Don't specify it.

        

      

    
    - **instanceRole** *(string) --* 

      The Amazon ECS instance profile applied to Amazon EC2 instances in a compute environment. Required for Amazon EC2 instances. You can specify the short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an instance profile. For example, ``ecsInstanceRole`` or ``arn:aws:iam::<aws_account_id>:instance-profile/ecsInstanceRole ``. For more information, see `Amazon ECS instance role <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/instance_IAM_role.html>`__ in the *Batch User Guide*.

       

      When updating a compute environment, changing this setting requires an infrastructure update of the compute environment. For more information, see `Updating compute environments <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html>`__ in the *Batch User Guide*.

       

      .. note::

        

        This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources. Don't specify it.

        

      

    
    - **tags** *(dict) --* 

      Key-value pair tags to be applied to Amazon EC2 resources that are launched in the compute environment. For Batch, these take the form of ``"String1": "String2"``, where ``String1`` is the tag key and ``String2`` is the tag value (for example, ``{ "Name": "Batch Instance - C4OnDemand" }``). This is helpful for recognizing your Batch instances in the Amazon EC2 console. These tags aren't seen when using the Batch ``ListTagsForResource`` API operation.

       

      When updating a compute environment, changing this setting requires an infrastructure update of the compute environment. For more information, see `Updating compute environments <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html>`__ in the *Batch User Guide*.

       

      .. note::

        

        This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources. Don't specify it.

        

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
  

    - **placementGroup** *(string) --* 

      The Amazon EC2 placement group to associate with your compute resources. If you intend to submit multi-node parallel jobs to your compute environment, you should consider creating a cluster placement group and associate it with your compute resources. This keeps your multi-node parallel job on a logical grouping of instances within a single Availability Zone with high network flow potential. For more information, see `Placement groups <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*.

       

      When updating a compute environment, changing the placement group requires an infrastructure update of the compute environment. For more information, see `Updating compute environments <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html>`__ in the *Batch User Guide*.

       

      .. note::

        

        This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources. Don't specify it.

        

      

    
    - **bidPercentage** *(integer) --* 

      The maximum percentage that a Spot Instance price can be when compared with the On-Demand price for that instance type before instances are launched. For example, if your maximum percentage is 20%, the Spot price must be less than 20% of the current On-Demand price for that Amazon EC2 instance. You always pay the lowest (market) price and never more than your maximum percentage. For most use cases, we recommend leaving this field empty.

       

      When updating a compute environment, changing the bid percentage requires an infrastructure update of the compute environment. For more information, see `Updating compute environments <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html>`__ in the *Batch User Guide*.

       

      .. note::

        

        This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources. Don't specify it.

        

      

    
    - **launchTemplate** *(dict) --* 

      The updated launch template to use for your compute resources. You must specify either the launch template ID or launch template name in the request, but not both. For more information, see `Launch template support <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/launch-templates.html>`__ in the *Batch User Guide*. To remove the custom launch template and use the default launch template, set ``launchTemplateId`` or ``launchTemplateName`` member of the launch template specification to an empty string. Removing the launch template from a compute environment will not remove the AMI specified in the launch template. In order to update the AMI specified in a launch template, the ``updateToLatestImageVersion`` parameter must be set to ``true``.

       

      When updating a compute environment, changing the launch template requires an infrastructure update of the compute environment. For more information, see `Updating compute environments <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html>`__ in the *Batch User Guide*.

       

      .. note::

        

        This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources. Don't specify it.

        

      

    
      - **launchTemplateId** *(string) --* 

        The ID of the launch template.

        

      
      - **launchTemplateName** *(string) --* 

        The name of the launch template.

        

      
      - **version** *(string) --* 

        The version number of the launch template, ``$Default``, or ``$Latest``.

         

        If the value is ``$Default``, the default version of the launch template is used. If the value is ``$Latest``, the latest version of the launch template is used.

         

        .. warning::

           

          If the AMI ID that's used in a compute environment is from the launch template, the AMI isn't changed when the compute environment is updated. It's only changed if the ``updateToLatestImageVersion`` parameter for the compute environment is set to ``true``. During an infrastructure update, if either ``$Default`` or ``$Latest`` is specified, Batch re-evaluates the launch template version, and it might use a different version of the launch template. This is the case even if the launch template isn't specified in the update. When updating a compute environment, changing the launch template requires an infrastructure update of the compute environment. For more information, see `Updating compute environments <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html>`__ in the *Batch User Guide*.

           

         

        Default: ``$Default``

         

        Latest: ``$Latest``

        

      
      - **overrides** *(list) --* 

        A launch template to use in place of the default launch template. You must specify either the launch template ID or launch template name in the request, but not both.

         

        You can specify up to ten (10) launch template overrides that are associated to unique instance types or families for each compute environment.

         

        .. note::

          

          To unset all override templates for a compute environment, you can pass an empty array to the `UpdateComputeEnvironment.overrides <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateComputeEnvironment.html>`__ parameter, or not include the ``overrides`` parameter when submitting the ``UpdateComputeEnvironment`` API operation.

          

        

      
        - *(dict) --* 

          An object that represents a launch template to use in place of the default launch template. You must specify either the launch template ID or launch template name in the request, but not both.

           

          If security groups are specified using both the ``securityGroupIds`` parameter of ``CreateComputeEnvironment`` and the launch template, the values in the ``securityGroupIds`` parameter of ``CreateComputeEnvironment`` will be used.

           

          You can define up to ten (10) overrides for each compute environment.

           

          .. note::

            

            This object isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources.

            

           

          .. note::

            

            To unset all override templates for a compute environment, you can pass an empty array to the `UpdateComputeEnvironment.overrides <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateComputeEnvironment.html>`__ parameter, or not include the ``overrides`` parameter when submitting the ``UpdateComputeEnvironment`` API operation.

            

          

        
          - **launchTemplateId** *(string) --* 

            The ID of the launch template.

             

            **Note:** If you specify the ``launchTemplateId`` you can't specify the ``launchTemplateName`` as well.

            

          
          - **launchTemplateName** *(string) --* 

            The name of the launch template.

             

            **Note:** If you specify the ``launchTemplateName`` you can't specify the ``launchTemplateId`` as well.

            

          
          - **version** *(string) --* 

            The version number of the launch template, ``$Default``, or ``$Latest``.

             

            If the value is ``$Default``, the default version of the launch template is used. If the value is ``$Latest``, the latest version of the launch template is used.

             

            .. warning::

               

              If the AMI ID that's used in a compute environment is from the launch template, the AMI isn't changed when the compute environment is updated. It's only changed if the ``updateToLatestImageVersion`` parameter for the compute environment is set to ``true``. During an infrastructure update, if either ``$Default`` or ``$Latest`` is specified, Batch re-evaluates the launch template version, and it might use a different version of the launch template. This is the case even if the launch template isn't specified in the update. When updating a compute environment, changing the launch template requires an infrastructure update of the compute environment. For more information, see `Updating compute environments <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html>`__ in the *Batch User Guide*.

               

             

            Default: ``$Default``

             

            Latest: ``$Latest``

            

          
          - **targetInstanceTypes** *(list) --* 

            The instance type or family that this override launch template should be applied to.

             

            This parameter is required when defining a launch template override.

             

            Information included in this parameter must meet the following requirements:

             

            
            * Must be a valid Amazon EC2 instance type or family.
             
            * The following Batch ``InstanceTypes`` are not allowed: ``optimal``, ``default_x86_64``, and ``default_arm64``.
             
            * ``targetInstanceTypes`` can target only instance types and families that are included within the `ComputeResource.instanceTypes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/APIReference/API_ComputeResource.html#Batch-Type-ComputeResource-instanceTypes>`__ set. ``targetInstanceTypes`` doesn't need to include all of the instances from the ``instanceType`` set, but at least a subset. For example, if ``ComputeResource.instanceTypes`` includes ``[m5, g5]``, ``targetInstanceTypes`` can include ``[m5.2xlarge]`` and ``[m5.large]`` but not ``[c5.large]``.
             
            * ``targetInstanceTypes`` included within the same launch template override or across launch template overrides can't overlap for the same compute environment. For example, you can't define one launch template override to target an instance family and another define an instance type within this same family.
            

            

          
            - *(string) --* 

            
        
          - **userdataType** *(string) --* 

            The EKS node initialization process to use. You only need to specify this value if you are using a custom AMI. The default value is ``EKS_BOOTSTRAP_SH``. If *imageType* is a custom AMI based on EKS_AL2023 or EKS_AL2023_NVIDIA then you must choose ``EKS_NODEADM``.

            

          
        
    
      - **userdataType** *(string) --*

    - **ec2Configuration** *(list) --* 

      Provides information used to select Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) for Amazon EC2 instances in the compute environment. If ``Ec2Configuration`` isn't specified, the default is ``ECS_AL2``.

       

      When updating a compute environment, changing this setting requires an infrastructure update of the compute environment. For more information, see `Updating compute environments <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html>`__ in the *Batch User Guide*. To remove the Amazon EC2 configuration and any custom AMI ID specified in ``imageIdOverride``, set this value to an empty string.

       

      One or two values can be provided.

  :type serviceRole: string
  :param serviceRole: 

    The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that allows Batch to make calls to other Amazon Web Services services on your behalf. For more information, see `Batch service IAM role <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/service_IAM_role.html>`__ in the *Batch User Guide*.

     

    .. warning::

       

      If the compute environment has a service-linked role, it can't be changed to use a regular IAM role. Likewise, if the compute environment has a regular IAM role, it can't be changed to use a service-linked role. To update the parameters for the compute environment that require an infrastructure update to change, the **AWSServiceRoleForBatch** service-linked role must be used. For more information, see `Updating compute environments <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html>`__ in the *Batch User Guide*.

       

     

    If your specified role has a path other than ``/``, then you must either specify the full role ARN (recommended) or prefix the role name with the path.

     

    .. note::

      

      Depending on how you created your Batch service role, its ARN might contain the ``service-role`` path prefix. When you only specify the name of the service role, Batch assumes that your ARN doesn't use the ``service-role`` path prefix. Because of this, we recommend that you specify the full ARN of your service role when you create compute environments.

      

    

  
  :type updatePolicy: dict
  :param updatePolicy: 

    Specifies the updated infrastructure update policy for the compute environment. For more information about infrastructure updates, see `Updating compute environments <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html>`__ in the *Batch User Guide*.
