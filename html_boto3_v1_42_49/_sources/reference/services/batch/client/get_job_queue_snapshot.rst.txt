      - **frontOfQueue** *(dict) --* 

        The list of the first 100 ``RUNNABLE`` jobs in each job queue. For first-in-first-out (FIFO) job queues, jobs are ordered based on their submission time. For fair-share scheduling (FSS) job queues, jobs are ordered based on their job priority and share usage.

        
        

        - **jobs** *(list) --* 

          The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the first 100 ``RUNNABLE`` jobs in a named job queue. For first-in-first-out (FIFO) job queues, jobs are ordered based on their submission time. For fair-share scheduling (FSS) job queues, jobs are ordered based on their job priority and share usage.
