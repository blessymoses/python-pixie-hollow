.. py:method:: VerifiedPermissions.Client.create_policy_template(**kwargs)

  

  Creates a policy template. A template can use placeholders for the principal and resource. A template must be instantiated into a policy by associating it with specific principals and resources to use for the placeholders. That instantiated policy can then be considered in authorization decisions. The instantiated policy works identically to any other policy, except that it is dynamically linked to the template. If the template changes, then any policies that are linked to that template are immediately updated as well.

   

  .. note::

    

    Verified Permissions is `eventually consistent <https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency>`__ . It can take a few seconds for a new or changed element to propagate through the service and be visible in the results of other Verified Permissions operations.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.create_policy_template(
        clientToken='string',
        policyStoreId='string',
        description='string',
        statement='string'
    )
    
  :type clientToken: string
  :param clientToken: 

    Specifies a unique, case-sensitive ID that you provide to ensure the idempotency of the request. This lets you safely retry the request without accidentally performing the same operation a second time. Passing the same value to a later call to an operation requires that you also pass the same value for all other parameters. We recommend that you use a `UUID type of value. <https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier>`__.

     

    If you don't provide this value, then Amazon Web Services generates a random one for you.

     

    If you retry the operation with the same ``ClientToken``, but with different parameters, the retry fails with an ``ConflictException`` error.

     

    Verified Permissions recognizes a ``ClientToken`` for eight hours. After eight hours, the next request with the same parameters performs the operation again regardless of the value of ``ClientToken``.

    This field is autopopulated if not provided.

  
  :type policyStoreId: string
  :param policyStoreId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ID of the policy store in which to create the policy template.

    

  
  :type description: string
  :param description: 

    Specifies a description for the policy template.

    

  
  :type statement: string
  :param statement: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies the content that you want to use for the new policy template, written in the Cedar policy language.
