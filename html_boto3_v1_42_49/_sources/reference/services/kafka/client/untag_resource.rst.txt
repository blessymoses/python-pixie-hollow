  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.untag_resource(
        ResourceArn='string',
        TagKeys=[
            'string',
        ]
    )
    
  :type ResourceArn: string
  :param ResourceArn: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies the resource that's associated with the tags.

    

  
  :type TagKeys: list
  :param TagKeys: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Tag keys must be unique for a given cluster. In addition, the following restrictions apply:

    
            

    
    * Each tag key must be unique. If you add a tag with a key that's already in use, your new tag overwrites the existing key-value pair.
    
               
    * You can't start a tag key with aws: because this prefix is reserved for use by AWS. AWS creates tags that begin with this prefix on your behalf, but you can't edit or delete them.
    
               
    * Tag keys must be between 1 and 128 Unicode characters in length.
    
               
    * Tag keys must consist of the following characters: Unicode letters, digits, white space, and the following special characters: _ . / = + - @.
