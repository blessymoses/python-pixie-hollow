.. py:method:: DataPipeline.Client.delete_pipeline(**kwargs)

  

  Deletes a pipeline, its pipeline definition, and its run history. AWS Data Pipeline attempts to cancel instances associated with the pipeline that are currently being processed by task runners.

   

  Deleting a pipeline cannot be undone. You cannot query or restore a deleted pipeline. To temporarily pause a pipeline instead of deleting it, call  SetStatus with the status set to ``PAUSE`` on individual components. Components that are paused by  SetStatus can be resumed.
