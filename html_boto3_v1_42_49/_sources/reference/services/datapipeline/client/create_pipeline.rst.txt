  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.create_pipeline(
        name='string',
        uniqueId='string',
        description='string',
        tags=[
            {
                'key': 'string',
                'value': 'string'
            },
        ]
    )
    
  :type name: string
  :param name: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name for the pipeline. You can use the same name for multiple pipelines associated with your AWS account, because AWS Data Pipeline assigns each pipeline a unique pipeline identifier.

    

  
  :type uniqueId: string
  :param uniqueId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A unique identifier. This identifier is not the same as the pipeline identifier assigned by AWS Data Pipeline. You are responsible for defining the format and ensuring the uniqueness of this identifier. You use this parameter to ensure idempotency during repeated calls to ``CreatePipeline``. For example, if the first call to ``CreatePipeline`` does not succeed, you can pass in the same unique identifier and pipeline name combination on a subsequent call to ``CreatePipeline``. ``CreatePipeline`` ensures that if a pipeline already exists with the same name and unique identifier, a new pipeline is not created. Instead, you'll receive the pipeline identifier from the previous attempt. The uniqueness of the name and unique identifier combination is scoped to the AWS account or IAM user credentials.

    

  
  :type description: string
  :param description: 

    The description for the pipeline.

    

  
  :type tags: list
  :param tags: 

    A list of tags to associate with the pipeline at creation. Tags let you control access to pipelines. For more information, see `Controlling User Access to Pipelines <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/datapipeline/latest/DeveloperGuide/dp-control-access.html>`__ in the *AWS Data Pipeline Developer Guide*.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      Tags are key/value pairs defined by a user and associated with a pipeline to control access. AWS Data Pipeline allows you to associate ten tags per pipeline. For more information, see `Controlling User Access to Pipelines <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/datapipeline/latest/DeveloperGuide/dp-control-access.html>`__ in the *AWS Data Pipeline Developer Guide*.

      

    
      - **key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The key name of a tag defined by a user. For more information, see `Controlling User Access to Pipelines <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/datapipeline/latest/DeveloperGuide/dp-control-access.html>`__ in the *AWS Data Pipeline Developer Guide*.

        

      
      - **value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The optional value portion of a tag defined by a user. For more information, see `Controlling User Access to Pipelines <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/datapipeline/latest/DeveloperGuide/dp-control-access.html>`__ in the *AWS Data Pipeline Developer Guide*.
