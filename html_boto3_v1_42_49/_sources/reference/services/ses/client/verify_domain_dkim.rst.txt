.. py:method:: SES.Client.verify_domain_dkim(**kwargs)

  

  Returns a set of DKIM tokens for a domain identity.

   

  .. warning::

     

    When you execute the ``VerifyDomainDkim`` operation, the domain that you specify is added to the list of identities that are associated with your account. This is true even if you haven't already associated the domain with your account by using the ``VerifyDomainIdentity`` operation. However, you can't send email from the domain until you either successfully `verify it <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/creating-identities.html#verify-domain-procedure>`__ or you successfully `set up DKIM for it <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/send-email-authentication-dkim-easy.html>`__.

     

   

  You use the tokens that are generated by this operation to create CNAME records. When Amazon SES detects that you've added these records to the DNS configuration for a domain, you can start sending email from that domain. You can start sending email even if you haven't added the TXT record provided by the VerifyDomainIdentity operation to the DNS configuration for your domain. All email that you send from the domain is authenticated using DKIM.

   

  To create the CNAME records for DKIM authentication, use the following values:

   

  
  * **Name**: *token*._domainkey.*example.com*
   
  * **Type**: CNAME
   
  * **Value**: *token*.dkim.amazonses.com
  

   

  In the preceding example, replace *token* with one of the tokens that are generated when you execute this operation. Replace *example.com* with your domain. Repeat this process for each token that's generated by this operation.

   

  You can execute this operation no more than once per second.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.verify_domain_dkim(
        Domain='string'
    )
    
  :type Domain: string
  :param Domain: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of the domain to be verified for Easy DKIM signing.

    **Response Syntax**

    
    ::

      {
          'DkimTokens': [
              'string',
          ]
      }
      
    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 

      Returns CNAME records that you must publish to the DNS server of your domain to set up Easy DKIM with Amazon SES.

      
      

      - **DkimTokens** *(list) --* 

        A set of character strings that represent the domain's identity. If the identity is an email address, the tokens represent the domain of that address.

         

        Using these tokens, you need to create DNS CNAME records that point to DKIM public keys that are hosted by Amazon SES. Amazon Web Services eventually detects that you've updated your DNS records. This detection process might take up to 72 hours. After successful detection, Amazon SES is able to DKIM-sign email originating from that domain. (This only applies to domain identities, not email address identities.)

         

        For more information about creating DNS records using DKIM tokens, see the `Amazon SES Developer Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/send-email-authentication-dkim-easy.html>`__.

  **Examples**

  The following example generates DKIM tokens for a domain that has been verified with Amazon SES:
  ::

    response = client.verify_domain_dkim(
        Domain='example.com',
    )
    
    print(response)

  
  Expected Output:
  ::

    {
        'DkimTokens': [
            'EXAMPLEq76owjnks3lnluwg65scbemvw',
            'EXAMPLEi3dnsj67hstzaj673klariwx2',
            'EXAMPLEwfbtcukvimehexktmdtaz6naj',
        ],
        'ResponseMetadata': {
            '...': '...',
        },
    }
