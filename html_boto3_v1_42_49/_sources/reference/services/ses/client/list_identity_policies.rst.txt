.. py:method:: SES.Client.list_identity_policies(**kwargs)

  

  Returns a list of sending authorization policies that are attached to the given identity (an email address or a domain). This operation returns only a list. To get the actual policy content, use ``GetIdentityPolicies``.

   

  .. note::

    

    This operation is for the identity owner only. If you have not verified the identity, it returns an error.

    

   

  Sending authorization is a feature that enables an identity owner to authorize other senders to use its identities. For information about using sending authorization, see the `Amazon SES Developer Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/sending-authorization.html>`__.

   

  You can execute this operation no more than once per second.
