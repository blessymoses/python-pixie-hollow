.. py:method:: SES.Client.list_configuration_sets(**kwargs)

  

  Provides a list of the configuration sets associated with your Amazon SES account in the current Amazon Web Services Region. For information about using configuration sets, see `Monitoring Your Amazon SES Sending Activity <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/monitor-sending-activity.html>`__ in the *Amazon SES Developer Guide.*

   

  You can execute this operation no more than once per second. This operation returns up to 1,000 configuration sets each time it is run. If your Amazon SES account has more than 1,000 configuration sets, this operation also returns ``NextToken``. You can then execute the ``ListConfigurationSets`` operation again, passing the ``NextToken`` parameter and the value of the NextToken element to retrieve additional results.
