.. py:method:: SES.Client.send_email(**kwargs)

  

  Composes an email message and immediately queues it for sending. To send email using this operation, your message must meet the following requirements:

   

  
  * The message must be sent from a verified email address or domain. If you attempt to send email using a non-verified address or domain, the operation results in an "Email address not verified" error.
   
  * If your account is still in the Amazon SES sandbox, you may only send to verified addresses or domains, or to email addresses associated with the Amazon SES Mailbox Simulator. For more information, see `Verifying Email Addresses and Domains <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/verify-addresses-and-domains.html>`__ in the *Amazon SES Developer Guide.*
   
  * The maximum message size is 10 MB.
   
  * The message must include at least one recipient email address. The recipient address can be a To: address, a CC: address, or a BCC: address. If a recipient email address is invalid (that is, it is not in the format *UserName@[SubDomain.]Domain.TopLevelDomain*), the entire message is rejected, even if the message contains other recipients that are valid.
   
  * The message may not include more than 50 recipients, across the To:, CC: and BCC: fields. If you need to send an email message to a larger audience, you can divide your recipient list into groups of 50 or fewer, and then call the ``SendEmail`` operation several times to send the message to each group.
  

   

  .. warning::

     

    For every message that you send, the total number of recipients (including each recipient in the To:, CC: and BCC: fields) is counted against the maximum number of emails you can send in a 24-hour period (your *sending quota*). For more information about sending quotas in Amazon SES, see `Managing Your Amazon SES Sending Limits <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/manage-sending-quotas.html>`__ in the *Amazon SES Developer Guide.*

        ],
        ConfigurationSetName='string'
    )
    
  :type Source: string
  :param Source: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The email address that is sending the email. This email address must be either individually verified with Amazon SES, or from a domain that has been verified with Amazon SES. For information about verifying identities, see the `Amazon SES Developer Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/creating-identities.html>`__.

     

    If you are sending on behalf of another user and have been permitted to do so by a sending authorization policy, then you must also specify the ``SourceArn`` parameter. For more information about sending authorization, see the `Amazon SES Developer Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/sending-authorization.html>`__.

     

    .. note::

      

      Amazon SES does not support the SMTPUTF8 extension, as described in `RFC6531 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6531>`__. For this reason, the email address string must be 7-bit ASCII. If you want to send to or from email addresses that contain Unicode characters in the domain part of an address, you must encode the domain using Punycode. Punycode is not permitted in the local part of the email address (the part before the @ sign) nor in the "friendly from" name. If you want to use Unicode characters in the "friendly from" name, you must encode the "friendly from" name using MIME encoded-word syntax, as described in `Sending raw email using the Amazon SES API <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/send-email-raw.html>`__. For more information about Punycode, see `RFC 3492 <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3492>`__.
