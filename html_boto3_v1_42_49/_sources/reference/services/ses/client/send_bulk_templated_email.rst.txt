.. py:method:: SES.Client.send_bulk_templated_email(**kwargs)

  

  Composes an email message to multiple destinations. The message body is created using an email template.

   

  To send email using this operation, your call must meet the following requirements:

   

  
  * The call must refer to an existing email template. You can create email templates using  CreateTemplate.
   
  * The message must be sent from a verified email address or domain.
   
  * If your account is still in the Amazon SES sandbox, you may send only to verified addresses or domains, or to email addresses associated with the Amazon SES Mailbox Simulator. For more information, see `Verifying Email Addresses and Domains <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/verify-addresses-and-domains.html>`__ in the *Amazon SES Developer Guide.*
   
  * The maximum message size is 10 MB.
   
  * Each ``Destination`` parameter must include at least one recipient email address. The recipient address can be a To: address, a CC: address, or a BCC: address. If a recipient email address is invalid (that is, it is not in the format *UserName@[SubDomain.]Domain.TopLevelDomain*), the entire message is rejected, even if the message contains other recipients that are valid.
   
  * The message may not include more than 50 recipients, across the To:, CC: and BCC: fields. If you need to send an email message to a larger audience, you can divide your recipient list into groups of 50 or fewer, and then call the ``SendBulkTemplatedEmail`` operation several times to send the message to each group.
   
  * The number of destinations you can contact in a single call can be limited by your account's maximum sending rate.

        ]
    )
    
  :type Source: string
  :param Source: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The email address that is sending the email. This email address must be either individually verified with Amazon SES, or from a domain that has been verified with Amazon SES. For information about verifying identities, see the `Amazon SES Developer Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/creating-identities.html>`__.

     

    If you are sending on behalf of another user and have been permitted to do so by a sending authorization policy, then you must also specify the ``SourceArn`` parameter. For more information about sending authorization, see the `Amazon SES Developer Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/sending-authorization.html>`__.

     

    .. note::

      

      Amazon SES does not support the SMTPUTF8 extension, as described in `RFC6531 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6531>`__. For this reason, the email address string must be 7-bit ASCII. If you want to send to or from email addresses that contain Unicode characters in the domain part of an address, you must encode the domain using Punycode. Punycode is not permitted in the local part of the email address (the part before the @ sign) nor in the "friendly from" name. If you want to use Unicode characters in the "friendly from" name, you must encode the "friendly from" name using MIME encoded-word syntax, as described in `Sending raw email using the Amazon SES API <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/send-email-raw.html>`__. For more information about Punycode, see `RFC 3492 <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3492>`__.

      

    

  
  :type SourceArn: string
  :param SourceArn: 

    This parameter is used only for sending authorization. It is the ARN of the identity that is associated with the sending authorization policy that permits you to send for the email address specified in the ``Source`` parameter.

     

    For example, if the owner of ``example.com`` (which has ARN ``arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com``) attaches a policy to it that authorizes you to send from ``user@example.com``, then you would specify the ``SourceArn`` to be ``arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com``, and the ``Source`` to be ``user@example.com``.

     

    For more information about sending authorization, see the `Amazon SES Developer Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/sending-authorization.html>`__.

    

  
  :type ReplyToAddresses: list
  :param ReplyToAddresses: 

    The reply-to email address(es) for the message. If the recipient replies to the message, each reply-to address receives the reply.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type ReturnPath: string
  :param ReturnPath: 

    The email address that bounces and complaints are forwarded to when feedback forwarding is enabled. If the message cannot be delivered to the recipient, then an error message is returned from the recipient's ISP; this message is forwarded to the email address specified by the ``ReturnPath`` parameter. The ``ReturnPath`` parameter is never overwritten. This email address must be either individually verified with Amazon SES, or from a domain that has been verified with Amazon SES.

    

  
  :type ReturnPathArn: string
  :param ReturnPathArn: 

    This parameter is used only for sending authorization. It is the ARN of the identity that is associated with the sending authorization policy that permits you to use the email address specified in the ``ReturnPath`` parameter.

     

    For example, if the owner of ``example.com`` (which has ARN ``arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com``) attaches a policy to it that authorizes you to use ``feedback@example.com``, then you would specify the ``ReturnPathArn`` to be ``arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com``, and the ``ReturnPath`` to be ``feedback@example.com``.

     

    For more information about sending authorization, see the `Amazon SES Developer Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/sending-authorization.html>`__.

  :param DefaultTemplateData: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A list of replacement values to apply to the template when replacement data is not specified in a Destination object. These values act as a default or fallback option when no other data is available.

     

    The template data is a JSON object, typically consisting of key-value pairs in which the keys correspond to replacement tags in the email template.

    

  
  :type Destinations: list
  :param Destinations: **[REQUIRED]** 

    One or more ``Destination`` objects. All of the recipients in a ``Destination`` receive the same version of the email. You can specify up to 50 ``Destination`` objects within a ``Destinations`` array.
