.. py:method:: SES.Client.verify_domain_identity(**kwargs)

  

  Adds a domain to the list of identities for your Amazon SES account in the current Amazon Web Services Region and attempts to verify it. For more information about verifying domains, see `Verifying Email Addresses and Domains <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/verify-addresses-and-domains.html>`__ in the *Amazon SES Developer Guide.*

   

  You can execute this operation no more than once per second.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.verify_domain_identity(
        Domain='string'
    )
    
  :type Domain: string
  :param Domain: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The domain to be verified.

    **Response Syntax**

    
    ::

      {
          'VerificationToken': 'string'
      }
      
    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 

      Returns a TXT record that you must publish to the DNS server of your domain to complete domain verification with Amazon SES.

      
      

      - **VerificationToken** *(string) --* 

        A TXT record that you must place in the DNS settings of the domain to complete domain verification with Amazon SES.

         

        As Amazon SES searches for the TXT record, the domain's verification status is "Pending". When Amazon SES detects the record, the domain's verification status changes to "Success". If Amazon SES is unable to detect the record within 72 hours, the domain's verification status changes to "Failed." In that case, to verify the domain, you must restart the verification process from the beginning. The domain's verification status also changes to "Success" when it is DKIM verified.

        
  

  **Examples**

  The following example starts the domain verification process with Amazon SES:
  ::

    response = client.verify_domain_identity(
        Domain='example.com',
    )
    
    print(response)

  
  Expected Output:
  ::

    {
        'VerificationToken': 'eoEmxw+YaYhb3h3iVJHuXMJXqeu1q1/wwmvjuEXAMPLE',
        'ResponseMetadata': {
            '...': '...',
        },
    }
