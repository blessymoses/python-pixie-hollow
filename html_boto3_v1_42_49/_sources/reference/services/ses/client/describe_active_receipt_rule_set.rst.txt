    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 

      Represents the metadata and receipt rules for the receipt rule set that is currently active.

      
      

      - **Metadata** *(dict) --* 

        The metadata for the currently active receipt rule set. The metadata consists of the rule set name and a timestamp of when the rule set was created.

        
        

        - **Name** *(string) --* 

          The name of the receipt rule set. The name must meet the following requirements:

           

          
          * Contain only ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), underscores (_), or dashes (-).
           
          * Start and end with a letter or number.
           
          * Contain 64 characters or fewer.
          

          
        

        - **CreatedTimestamp** *(datetime) --* 

          The date and time the receipt rule set was created.

          
    
      

      - **Rules** *(list) --* 

        The receipt rules that belong to the active rule set.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          Receipt rules enable you to specify which actions Amazon SES should take when it receives mail on behalf of one or more email addresses or domains that you own.

           

          Each receipt rule defines a set of email addresses or domains that it applies to. If the email addresses or domains match at least one recipient address of the message, Amazon SES executes all of the receipt rule's actions on the message.

           

          For information about setting up receipt rules, see the `Amazon SES Developer Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/receiving-email-receipt-rules-console-walkthrough.html>`__.

          
          

          - **Name** *(string) --* 

            The name of the receipt rule. The name must meet the following requirements:

             

            
            * Contain only ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), underscores (_), dashes (-), or periods (.).
             
            * Start and end with a letter or number.
             
            * Contain 64 characters or fewer.
            

            
          

          - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

            If ``true``, the receipt rule is active. The default value is ``false``.

            
          

          - **TlsPolicy** *(string) --* 

            Specifies whether Amazon SES should require that incoming email is delivered over a connection encrypted with Transport Layer Security (TLS). If this parameter is set to ``Require``, Amazon SES bounces emails that are not received over TLS. The default is ``Optional``.

            
          

          - **Recipients** *(list) --* 

            The recipient domains and email addresses that the receipt rule applies to. If this field is not specified, this rule matches all recipients on all verified domains.

            
            

            - *(string) --*

            - *(dict) --* 

              An action that Amazon SES can take when it receives an email on behalf of one or more email addresses or domains that you own. An instance of this data type can represent only one action.

               

              For information about setting up receipt rules, see the `Amazon SES Developer Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/receiving-email-receipt-rules-console-walkthrough.html>`__.

              
              

              - **S3Action** *(dict) --* 

                Saves the received message to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket and, optionally, publishes a notification to Amazon SNS.

                
                

                - **TopicArn** *(string) --* 

                  The ARN of the Amazon SNS topic to notify when the message is saved to the Amazon S3 bucket. You can find the ARN of a topic by using the `ListTopics <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/api/API_ListTopics.html>`__ operation in Amazon SNS.

                   

                  For more information about Amazon SNS topics, see the `Amazon SNS Developer Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/CreateTopic.html>`__.

                  
                

                - **BucketName** *(string) --* 

                  The name of the Amazon S3 bucket for incoming email.

                  
                

                - **ObjectKeyPrefix** *(string) --* 

                  The key prefix of the Amazon S3 bucket. The key prefix is similar to a directory name that enables you to store similar data under the same directory in a bucket.

                  
                

                - **KmsKeyArn** *(string) --* 

                  The customer managed key that Amazon SES should use to encrypt your emails before saving them to the Amazon S3 bucket. You can use the Amazon Web Services managed key or a customer managed key that you created in Amazon Web Services KMS as follows:

                   

                  
                  * To use the Amazon Web Services managed key, provide an ARN in the form of ``arn:aws:kms:REGION:ACCOUNT-ID-WITHOUT-HYPHENS:alias/aws/ses``. For example, if your Amazon Web Services account ID is 123456789012 and you want to use the Amazon Web Services managed key in the US West (Oregon) Region, the ARN of the Amazon Web Services managed key would be ``arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:123456789012:alias/aws/ses``. If you use the Amazon Web Services managed key, you don't need to perform any extra steps to give Amazon SES permission to use the key.
                   
                  * To use a customer managed key that you created in Amazon Web Services KMS, provide the ARN of the customer managed key and ensure that you add a statement to your key's policy to give Amazon SES permission to use it. For more information about giving permissions, see the `Amazon SES Developer Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/receiving-email-permissions.html>`__.
                  

                   

                  For more information about key policies, see the `Amazon Web Services KMS Developer Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html>`__. If you do not specify an Amazon Web Services KMS key, Amazon SES does not encrypt your emails.

                   

                  .. warning::

                     

                    Your mail is encrypted by Amazon SES using the Amazon S3 encryption client before the mail is submitted to Amazon S3 for storage. It is not encrypted using Amazon S3 server-side encryption. This means that you must use the Amazon S3 encryption client to decrypt the email after retrieving it from Amazon S3, as the service has no access to use your Amazon Web Services KMS keys for decryption. This encryption client is currently available with the `Amazon Web Services SDK for Java <http://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/>`__ and `Amazon Web Services SDK for Ruby <http://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/>`__ only. For more information about client-side encryption using Amazon Web Services KMS managed keys, see the `Amazon S3 Developer Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingClientSideEncryption.html>`__.

                    

                  
                

                - **IamRoleArn** *(string) --* 

                  The ARN of the IAM role to be used by Amazon Simple Email Service while writing to the Amazon S3 bucket, optionally encrypting your mail via the provided customer managed key, and publishing to the Amazon SNS topic. This role should have access to the following APIs:

                   

                  
                  * ``s3:PutObject``, ``kms:Encrypt`` and ``kms:GenerateDataKey`` for the given Amazon S3 bucket.
                   
                  * ``kms:GenerateDataKey`` for the given Amazon Web Services KMS customer managed key.
                   
                  * ``sns:Publish`` for the given Amazon SNS topic.
                  

                   

                  .. note::

                    

                    If an IAM role ARN is provided, the role (and only the role) is used to access all the given resources (Amazon S3 bucket, Amazon Web Services KMS customer managed key and Amazon SNS topic). Therefore, setting up individual resource access permissions is not required.

              - **WorkmailAction** *(dict) --* 

                Calls Amazon WorkMail and, optionally, publishes a notification to Amazon Amazon SNS.

                  You can find the ID of your organization by using the `ListOrganizations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workmail/latest/APIReference/API_ListOrganizations.html>`__ operation in Amazon WorkMail.
