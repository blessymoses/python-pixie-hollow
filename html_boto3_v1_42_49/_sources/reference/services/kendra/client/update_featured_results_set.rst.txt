You can still configure your settings before setting the status to ``ACTIVE``. You can set the status to ``ACTIVE`` or ``INACTIVE`` using the `UpdateFeaturedResultsSet <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/API_UpdateFeaturedResultsSet.html>`__ API.

        - **QueryTexts** *(list) --* 

          The list of queries for featuring results.

           

          Specific queries are mapped to specific documents for featuring in the results. If a query contains an exact match, then one or more specific documents are featured in the results. The exact match applies to the full query. For example, if you only specify 'Kendra', queries such as 'How does kendra semantically rank results?' will not render the featured results. Featured results are designed for specific queries, rather than queries that are too broad in scope.
