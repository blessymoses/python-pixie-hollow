.. py:method:: kendra.Client.update_query_suggestions_config(**kwargs)

  

  Updates the settings of query suggestions for an index.

   

  Amazon Kendra supports partial updates, so you only need to provide the fields you want to update.

   

  If an update is currently processing, you need to wait for the update to finish before making another update.

   

  Updates to query suggestions settings might not take effect right away. The time for your updated settings to take effect depends on the updates made and the number of search queries in your index.

   

  You can still enable/disable query suggestions at any time.

   

  ``UpdateQuerySuggestionsConfig`` is currently not supported in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US-West) region.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.update_query_suggestions_config(
        IndexId='string',
        Mode='ENABLED'|'LEARN_ONLY',
        QueryLogLookBackWindowInDays=123,
        IncludeQueriesWithoutUserInformation=True|False,
        MinimumNumberOfQueryingUsers=123,
        MinimumQueryCount=123,
        AttributeSuggestionsConfig={
            'SuggestableConfigList': [
                {
                    'AttributeName': 'string',
                    'Suggestable': True|False
                },
            ],
            'AttributeSuggestionsMode': 'ACTIVE'|'INACTIVE'
        }
    )
    
  :type IndexId: string
  :param IndexId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The identifier of the index with query suggestions you want to update.

    

  
  :type Mode: string
  :param Mode: 

    Set the mode to ``ENABLED`` or ``LEARN_ONLY``.

     

    By default, Amazon Kendra enables query suggestions. ``LEARN_ONLY`` mode allows you to turn off query suggestions. You can to update this at any time.

     

    In ``LEARN_ONLY`` mode, Amazon Kendra continues to learn from new queries to keep suggestions up to date for when you are ready to switch to ENABLED mode again.

    

  
  :type QueryLogLookBackWindowInDays: integer
  :param QueryLogLookBackWindowInDays: 

    How recent your queries are in your query log time window.

     

    The time window is the number of days from current day to past days.

     

    By default, Amazon Kendra sets this to 180.

    

  
  :type IncludeQueriesWithoutUserInformation: boolean
  :param IncludeQueriesWithoutUserInformation: 

    ``TRUE`` to include queries without user information (i.e. all queries, irrespective of the user), otherwise ``FALSE`` to only include queries with user information.

     

    If you pass user information to Amazon Kendra along with the queries, you can set this flag to ``FALSE`` and instruct Amazon Kendra to only consider queries with user information.

     

    If you set to ``FALSE``, Amazon Kendra only considers queries searched at least ``MinimumQueryCount`` times across ``MinimumNumberOfQueryingUsers`` unique users for suggestions.

     

    If you set to ``TRUE``, Amazon Kendra ignores all user information and learns from all queries.

    

  
  :type MinimumNumberOfQueryingUsers: integer
  :param MinimumNumberOfQueryingUsers: 

    The minimum number of unique users who must search a query in order for the query to be eligible to suggest to your users.

     

    Increasing this number might decrease the number of suggestions. However, this ensures a query is searched by many users and is truly popular to suggest to users.

     

    How you tune this setting depends on your specific needs.

    

  
  :type MinimumQueryCount: integer
  :param MinimumQueryCount: 

    The the minimum number of times a query must be searched in order to be eligible to suggest to your users.

     

    Decreasing this number increases the number of suggestions. However, this affects the quality of suggestions as it sets a low bar for a query to be considered popular to suggest to users.

     

    How you tune this setting depends on your specific needs.

    

  
  :type AttributeSuggestionsConfig: dict
  :param AttributeSuggestionsConfig: 

    Configuration information for the document fields/attributes that you want to base query suggestions on.

    

  
    - **SuggestableConfigList** *(list) --* 

      The list of fields/attributes that you want to set as suggestible for query suggestions.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        Provides the configuration information for a document field/attribute that you want to base query suggestions on.

        

      
        - **AttributeName** *(string) --* 

          The name of the document field/attribute.

          

        
        - **Suggestable** *(boolean) --* 

          ``TRUE`` means the document field/attribute is suggestible, so the contents within the field can be used for query suggestions.

          

        
      
  
    - **AttributeSuggestionsMode** *(string) --* 

      You can set the mode to ``ACTIVE`` or ``INACTIVE``. You must also set ``SuggestionTypes`` as either ``QUERY`` or ``DOCUMENT_ATTRIBUTES`` and then call `GetQuerySuggestions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/API_GetQuerySuggestions.html>`__. If ``Mode`` to use query history is set to ``ENABLED`` when calling `UpdateQuerySuggestionsConfig <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/API_UpdateQuerySuggestionsConfig.html>`__ and ``AttributeSuggestionsMode`` to use fields/attributes is set to ``ACTIVE``, and you haven't set your ``SuggestionTypes`` preference to ``DOCUMENT_ATTRIBUTES``, then Amazon Kendra uses the query history.
