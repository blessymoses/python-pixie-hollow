.. py:method:: KMS.Client.describe_custom_key_stores(**kwargs)

  

  Gets information about `custom key stores <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-store-overview.html>`__ in the account and Region.

   

  This operation is part of the custom key stores feature in KMS, which combines the convenience and extensive integration of KMS with the isolation and control of a key store that you own and manage.

   

  By default, this operation returns information about all custom key stores in the account and Region. To get only information about a particular custom key store, use either the ``CustomKeyStoreName`` or ``CustomKeyStoreId`` parameter (but not both).

   

  To determine whether the custom key store is connected to its CloudHSM cluster or external key store proxy, use the ``ConnectionState`` element in the response. If an attempt to connect the custom key store failed, the ``ConnectionState`` value is ``FAILED`` and the ``ConnectionErrorCode`` element in the response indicates the cause of the failure. For help interpreting the ``ConnectionErrorCode``, see  CustomKeyStoresListEntry.

   

  Custom key stores have a ``DISCONNECTED`` connection state if the key store has never been connected or you used the  DisconnectCustomKeyStore operation to disconnect it. Otherwise, the connection state is CONNECTED. If your custom key store connection state is ``CONNECTED`` but you are having trouble using it, verify that the backing store is active and available. For an CloudHSM key store, verify that the associated CloudHSM cluster is active and contains the minimum number of HSMs required for the operation, if any. For an external key store, verify that the external key store proxy and its associated external key manager are reachable and enabled.

   

  For help repairing your CloudHSM key store, see the `Troubleshooting CloudHSM key stores <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/fix-keystore.html>`__. For help repairing your external key store, see the `Troubleshooting external key stores <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/xks-troubleshooting.html>`__. Both topics are in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

   

  **Cross-account use**: No. You cannot perform this operation on a custom key store in a different Amazon Web Services account.

   

  **Required permissions**: `kms\:DescribeCustomKeyStores <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-api-permissions-reference.html>`__ (IAM policy)

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **CustomKeyStores** *(list) --* 

        Contains metadata about each custom key store.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          Contains information about each custom key store in the custom key store list.

          
          

          - **CustomKeyStoreId** *(string) --* 

            A unique identifier for the custom key store.

            
          

          - **CustomKeyStoreName** *(string) --* 

            The user-specified friendly name for the custom key store.

            
          

          - **CloudHsmClusterId** *(string) --* 

            A unique identifier for the CloudHSM cluster that is associated with an CloudHSM key store. This field appears only when the ``CustomKeyStoreType`` is ``AWS_CLOUDHSM``.

            
          

          - **TrustAnchorCertificate** *(string) --* 

            The trust anchor certificate of the CloudHSM cluster associated with an CloudHSM key store. When you `initialize the cluster <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/userguide/initialize-cluster.html#sign-csr>`__, you create this certificate and save it in the ``customerCA.crt`` file.

             

            This field appears only when the ``CustomKeyStoreType`` is ``AWS_CLOUDHSM``.

            
          

          - **ConnectionState** *(string) --* 

            Indicates whether the custom key store is connected to its backing key store. For an CloudHSM key store, the ``ConnectionState`` indicates whether it is connected to its CloudHSM cluster. For an external key store, the ``ConnectionState`` indicates whether it is connected to the external key store proxy that communicates with your external key manager.

             

            You can create and use KMS keys in your custom key stores only when its ``ConnectionState`` is ``CONNECTED``.

             

            The ``ConnectionState`` value is ``DISCONNECTED`` only if the key store has never been connected or you use the  DisconnectCustomKeyStore operation to disconnect it. If the value is ``CONNECTED`` but you are having trouble using the custom key store, make sure that the backing key store is reachable and active. For an CloudHSM key store, verify that its associated CloudHSM cluster is active and contains at least one active HSM. For an external key store, verify that the external key store proxy and external key manager are connected and enabled.

             

            A value of ``FAILED`` indicates that an attempt to connect was unsuccessful. The ``ConnectionErrorCode`` field in the response indicates the cause of the failure. For help resolving a connection failure, see `Troubleshooting a custom key store <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/fix-keystore.html>`__ in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

            
          

          - **ConnectionErrorCode** *(string) --* 

            Describes the connection error. This field appears in the response only when the ``ConnectionState`` is ``FAILED``.

             

            Many failures can be resolved by updating the properties of the custom key store. To update a custom key store, disconnect it (  DisconnectCustomKeyStore), correct the errors (  UpdateCustomKeyStore), and try to connect again (  ConnectCustomKeyStore). For additional help resolving these errors, see `How to Fix a Connection Failure <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/fix-keystore.html#fix-keystore-failed>`__ in *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

             

            **All custom key stores:**

             

            
            * ``INTERNAL_ERROR`` — KMS could not complete the request due to an internal error. Retry the request. For ``ConnectCustomKeyStore`` requests, disconnect the custom key store before trying to connect again.
             
            * ``NETWORK_ERRORS`` — Network errors are preventing KMS from connecting the custom key store to its backing key store.
            

             

            **CloudHSM key stores:**

             

            
            * ``CLUSTER_NOT_FOUND`` — KMS cannot find the CloudHSM cluster with the specified cluster ID.
             
            * ``INSUFFICIENT_CLOUDHSM_HSMS`` — The associated CloudHSM cluster does not contain any active HSMs. To connect a custom key store to its CloudHSM cluster, the cluster must contain at least one active HSM.
             
            * ``INSUFFICIENT_FREE_ADDRESSES_IN_SUBNET`` — At least one private subnet associated with the CloudHSM cluster doesn't have any available IP addresses. A CloudHSM key store connection requires one free IP address in each of the associated private subnets, although two are preferable. For details, see `How to Fix a Connection Failure <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/fix-keystore.html#fix-keystore-failed>`__ in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.
             
            * ``INVALID_CREDENTIALS`` — The ``KeyStorePassword`` for the custom key store doesn't match the current password of the ``kmsuser`` crypto user in the CloudHSM cluster. Before you can connect your custom key store to its CloudHSM cluster, you must change the ``kmsuser`` account password and update the ``KeyStorePassword`` value for the custom key store.
             
            * ``SUBNET_NOT_FOUND`` — A subnet in the CloudHSM cluster configuration was deleted. If KMS cannot find all of the subnets in the cluster configuration, attempts to connect the custom key store to the CloudHSM cluster fail. To fix this error, create a cluster from a recent backup and associate it with your custom key store. (This process creates a new cluster configuration with a VPC and private subnets.) For details, see `How to Fix a Connection Failure <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/fix-keystore.html#fix-keystore-failed>`__ in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.
             
            * ``USER_LOCKED_OUT`` — The ``kmsuser`` CU account is locked out of the associated CloudHSM cluster due to too many failed password attempts. Before you can connect your custom key store to its CloudHSM cluster, you must change the ``kmsuser`` account password and update the key store password value for the custom key store.
             
            * ``USER_LOGGED_IN`` — The ``kmsuser`` CU account is logged into the associated CloudHSM cluster. This prevents KMS from rotating the ``kmsuser`` account password and logging into the cluster. Before you can connect your custom key store to its CloudHSM cluster, you must log the ``kmsuser`` CU out of the cluster. If you changed the ``kmsuser`` password to log into the cluster, you must also and update the key store password value for the custom key store. For help, see `How to Log Out and Reconnect <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/fix-keystore.html#login-kmsuser-2>`__ in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.
             
            * ``USER_NOT_FOUND`` — KMS cannot find a ``kmsuser`` CU account in the associated CloudHSM cluster. Before you can connect your custom key store to its CloudHSM cluster, you must create a ``kmsuser`` CU account in the cluster, and then update the key store password value for the custom key store.
            

             

            **External key stores:**

             

            
            * ``INVALID_CREDENTIALS`` — One or both of the ``XksProxyAuthenticationCredential`` values is not valid on the specified external key store proxy.
             
            * ``XKS_PROXY_ACCESS_DENIED`` — KMS requests are denied access to the external key store proxy. If the external key store proxy has authorization rules, verify that they permit KMS to communicate with the proxy on your behalf.
             
            * ``XKS_PROXY_INVALID_CONFIGURATION`` — A configuration error is preventing the external key store from connecting to its proxy. Verify the value of the ``XksProxyUriPath``.
             
            * ``XKS_PROXY_INVALID_RESPONSE`` — KMS cannot interpret the response from the external key store proxy. If you see this connection error code repeatedly, notify your external key store proxy vendor.
             
            * ``XKS_PROXY_INVALID_TLS_CONFIGURATION`` — KMS cannot connect to the external key store proxy because the TLS configuration is invalid. Verify that the XKS proxy supports TLS 1.2 or 1.3. Also, verify that the TLS certificate is not expired, and that it matches the hostname in the ``XksProxyUriEndpoint`` value, and that it is signed by a certificate authority included in the `Trusted Certificate Authorities <https://github.com/aws/aws-kms-xksproxy-api-spec/blob/main/TrustedCertificateAuthorities>`__ list.
             
            * ``XKS_PROXY_NOT_REACHABLE`` — KMS can't communicate with your external key store proxy. Verify that the ``XksProxyUriEndpoint`` and ``XksProxyUriPath`` are correct. Use the tools for your external key store proxy to verify that the proxy is active and available on its network. Also, verify that your external key manager instances are operating properly. Connection attempts fail with this connection error code if the proxy reports that all external key manager instances are unavailable.
             
            * ``XKS_PROXY_TIMED_OUT`` — KMS can connect to the external key store proxy, but the proxy does not respond to KMS in the time allotted. If you see this connection error code repeatedly, notify your external key store proxy vendor.
             
            * ``XKS_VPC_ENDPOINT_SERVICE_INVALID_CONFIGURATION`` — The Amazon VPC endpoint service configuration doesn't conform to the requirements for an KMS external key store. 

              
              * The VPC endpoint service must be an endpoint service for interface endpoints in the caller's Amazon Web Services account.
               
              * It must have a network load balancer (NLB) connected to at least two subnets, each in a different Availability Zone.
               
              * The ``Allow principals`` list must include the KMS service principal for the Region, ``cks.kms.<region>.amazonaws.com``, such as ``cks.kms.us-east-1.amazonaws.com``.
               
              * It must *not* require `acceptance <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/create-endpoint-service.html>`__ of connection requests.
               
              * It must have a private DNS name. The private DNS name for an external key store with ``VPC_ENDPOINT_SERVICE`` connectivity must be unique in its Amazon Web Services Region.
               
              * The domain of the private DNS name must have a `verification status <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/verify-domains.html>`__ of ``verified``.
               
              * The `TLS certificate <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/create-tls-listener.html>`__ specifies the private DNS hostname at which the endpoint is reachable.
              

            
             
            * ``XKS_VPC_ENDPOINT_SERVICE_NOT_FOUND`` — KMS can't find the VPC endpoint service that it uses to communicate with the external key store proxy. Verify that the ``XksProxyVpcEndpointServiceName`` is correct and the KMS service principal has service consumer permissions on the Amazon VPC endpoint service.
            

            
          

          - **CreationDate** *(datetime) --* 

            The date and time when the custom key store was created.
