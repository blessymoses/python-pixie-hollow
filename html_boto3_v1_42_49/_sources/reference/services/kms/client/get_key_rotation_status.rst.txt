.. py:method:: KMS.Client.get_key_rotation_status(**kwargs)

  

  Provides detailed information about the rotation status for a KMS key, including whether `automatic rotation of the key material <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/rotating-keys-enable-disable.html>`__ is enabled for the specified KMS key, the `rotation period <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/rotate-keys.html#rotation-period>`__, and the next scheduled rotation date.

   

  Automatic key rotation is supported only on symmetric encryption KMS keys. You cannot enable automatic rotation of `asymmetric KMS keys <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html>`__, `HMAC KMS keys <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/hmac.html>`__, KMS keys with `imported key material <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/importing-keys.html>`__, or KMS keys in a `custom key store <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-store-overview.html>`__. To enable or disable automatic rotation of a set of related `multi-Region keys <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/rotate-keys.html#multi-region-rotate>`__, set the property on the primary key.

   

  You can enable (  EnableKeyRotation) and disable automatic rotation (  DisableKeyRotation) of the key material in customer managed KMS keys. Key material rotation of `Amazon Web Services managed KMS keys <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#aws-managed-key>`__ is not configurable. KMS always rotates the key material in Amazon Web Services managed KMS keys every year. The key rotation status for Amazon Web Services managed KMS keys is always ``true``.

   

  You can perform on-demand (  RotateKeyOnDemand) rotation of the key material in customer managed KMS keys, regardless of whether or not automatic key rotation is enabled. You can use GetKeyRotationStatus to identify the date and time that an in progress on-demand rotation was initiated. You can use  ListKeyRotations to view the details of completed rotations.

   

  .. note::

    

    In May 2022, KMS changed the rotation schedule for Amazon Web Services managed keys from every three years to every year. For details, see  EnableKeyRotation.

    

   

  The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see `Key states of KMS keys <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html>`__ in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

   

  
  * Disabled: The key rotation status does not change when you disable a KMS key. However, while the KMS key is disabled, KMS does not rotate the key material. When you re-enable the KMS key, rotation resumes. If the key material in the re-enabled KMS key hasn't been rotated in one year, KMS rotates it immediately, and every year thereafter. If it's been less than a year since the key material in the re-enabled KMS key was rotated, the KMS key resumes its prior rotation schedule.
   
  * Pending deletion: While a KMS key is pending deletion, its key rotation status is ``false`` and KMS does not rotate the key material. If you cancel the deletion, the original key rotation status returns to ``true``.
  

   

  **Cross-account use**: Yes. To perform this operation on a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account, specify the key ARN in the value of the ``KeyId`` parameter.

   

  **Required permissions**: `kms\:GetKeyRotationStatus <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-api-permissions-reference.html>`__ (key policy)

  **Eventual consistency**: The KMS API follows an eventual consistency model. For more information, see `KMS eventual consistency <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/accessing-kms.html#programming-eventual-consistency>`__.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.get_key_rotation_status(
        KeyId='string'
    )
    
  :type KeyId: string
  :param KeyId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Gets the rotation status for the specified KMS key.

     

    Specify the key ID or key ARN of the KMS key. To specify a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account, you must use the key ARN.

     

    For example:

     

    
    * Key ID: ``1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab``
     
    * Key ARN: ``arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab``
    

     

    To get the key ID and key ARN for a KMS key, use  ListKeys or  DescribeKey.

    **Response Syntax**

    
    ::

      {
          'KeyRotationEnabled': True|False,
          'KeyId': 'string',
          'RotationPeriodInDays': 123,
          'NextRotationDate': datetime(2015, 1, 1),
          'OnDemandRotationStartDate': datetime(2015, 1, 1)
      }
      
    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **KeyRotationEnabled** *(boolean) --* 

        A Boolean value that specifies whether key rotation is enabled.

        
      

      - **KeyId** *(string) --* 

        Identifies the specified symmetric encryption KMS key.

        
      

      - **RotationPeriodInDays** *(integer) --* 

        The number of days between each automatic rotation. The default value is 365 days.

        
      

      - **NextRotationDate** *(datetime) --* 

        The next date that KMS will automatically rotate the key material.

        
      

      - **OnDemandRotationStartDate** *(datetime) --* 

        Identifies the date and time that an in progress on-demand rotation was initiated.

         

        KMS uses a background process to perform rotations. As a result, there might be a slight delay between initiating on-demand key rotation and the rotation's completion. Once the on-demand rotation is complete, KMS removes this field from the response. You can use  ListKeyRotations to view the details of the completed on-demand rotation.

        
  
  **Exceptions**
  
  *   :py:class:`KMS.Client.exceptions.NotFoundException`

  
  *   :py:class:`KMS.Client.exceptions.InvalidArnException`

  *   :py:class:`KMS.Client.exceptions.UnsupportedOperationException`

  

  **Examples**

  The following example retrieves the status of automatic annual rotation of the key material for the specified KMS key.
  ::

    response = client.get_key_rotation_status(
        # The identifier of the KMS key whose key material rotation status you want to retrieve. You can use the key ID or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the KMS key.
        KeyId='1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab',
    )
    
    print(response)

  
  Expected Output:
  ::

    {
        # A boolean that indicates the key material rotation status. Returns true when automatic annual rotation of the key material is enabled, or false when it is not.
        'KeyRotationEnabled': True,
        'ResponseMetadata': {
            '...': '...',
        },
    }
