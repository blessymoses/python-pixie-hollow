.. py:method:: KMS.Client.schedule_key_deletion(**kwargs)

  

  Schedules the deletion of a KMS key. By default, KMS applies a waiting period of 30 days, but you can specify a waiting period of 7-30 days. When this operation is successful, the key state of the KMS key changes to ``PendingDeletion`` and the key can't be used in any cryptographic operations. It remains in this state for the duration of the waiting period. Before the waiting period ends, you can use  CancelKeyDeletion to cancel the deletion of the KMS key. After the waiting period ends, KMS deletes the KMS key, its key material, and all KMS data associated with it, including all aliases that refer to it.

   

  .. warning::

     

    Deleting a KMS key is a destructive and potentially dangerous operation. When a KMS key is deleted, all data that was encrypted under the KMS key is unrecoverable. (The only exception is a `multi-Region replica key <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-delete.html>`__, or an `asymmetric or HMAC KMS key with imported key material <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/deleting-keys.html#import-delete-key>`__.) To prevent the use of a KMS key without deleting it, use  DisableKey.

     

   

  You can schedule the deletion of a multi-Region primary key and its replica keys at any time. However, KMS will not delete a multi-Region primary key with existing replica keys. If you schedule the deletion of a primary key with replicas, its key state changes to ``PendingReplicaDeletion`` and it cannot be replicated or used in cryptographic operations. This status can continue indefinitely. When the last of its replicas keys is deleted (not just scheduled), the key state of the primary key changes to ``PendingDeletion`` and its waiting period ( ``PendingWindowInDays``) begins. For details, see `Deleting multi-Region keys <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/deleting-keys.html#deleting-mrks>`__ in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

   

  When KMS `deletes a KMS key from an CloudHSM key store <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/deleting-keys.html#delete-cmk-keystore>`__, it makes a best effort to delete the associated key material from the associated CloudHSM cluster. However, you might need to manually `delete the orphaned key material <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/fix-keystore.html#fix-keystore-orphaned-key>`__ from the cluster and its backups. `Deleting a KMS key from an external key store <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/deleting-keys.html#delete-xks-key>`__ has no effect on the associated external key. However, for both types of custom key stores, deleting a KMS key is destructive and irreversible. You cannot decrypt ciphertext encrypted under the KMS key by using only its associated external key or CloudHSM key. Also, you cannot recreate a KMS key in an external key store by creating a new KMS key with the same key material.

   

  For more information about scheduling a KMS key for deletion, see `Deleting KMS keys <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/deleting-keys.html>`__ in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

   

  The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see `Key states of KMS keys <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html>`__ in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

   

  **Cross-account use**: No. You cannot perform this operation on a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account.

   

  **Required permissions**: kms:ScheduleKeyDeletion (key policy)

   

  **Related operations**

   

  
  *  CancelKeyDeletion
   
  *  DisableKey
  

   

  **Eventual consistency**: The KMS API follows an eventual consistency model. For more information, see `KMS eventual consistency <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/accessing-kms.html#programming-eventual-consistency>`__.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.schedule_key_deletion(
        KeyId='string',
        PendingWindowInDays=123
    )
    
  :type KeyId: string
  :param KeyId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The unique identifier of the KMS key to delete.

     

    Specify the key ID or key ARN of the KMS key.

     

    For example:

     

    
    * Key ID: ``1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab``
     
    * Key ARN: ``arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab``
    

     

    To get the key ID and key ARN for a KMS key, use  ListKeys or  DescribeKey.

    

  
  :type PendingWindowInDays: integer
  :param PendingWindowInDays: 

    The waiting period, specified in number of days. After the waiting period ends, KMS deletes the KMS key.

     

    If the KMS key is a multi-Region primary key with replica keys, the waiting period begins when the last of its replica keys is deleted. Otherwise, the waiting period begins immediately.

     

    This value is optional. If you include a value, it must be between 7 and 30, inclusive. If you do not include a value, it defaults to 30. You can use the `kms\:ScheduleKeyDeletionPendingWindowInDays <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/conditions-kms.html#conditions-kms-schedule-key-deletion-pending-window-in-days>`__ condition key to further constrain the values that principals can specify in the ``PendingWindowInDays`` parameter.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **KeyId** *(string) --* 

        The Amazon Resource Name ( `key ARN <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-id-key-ARN>`__) of the KMS key whose deletion is scheduled.

        
      

      - **DeletionDate** *(datetime) --* 

        The date and time after which KMS deletes the KMS key.

         

        If the KMS key is a multi-Region primary key with replica keys, this field does not appear. The deletion date for the primary key isn't known until its last replica key is deleted.

        
      

      - **KeyState** *(string) --* 

        The current status of the KMS key.

      - **PendingWindowInDays** *(integer) --* 

        The waiting period before the KMS key is deleted.

         

        If the KMS key is a multi-Region primary key with replicas, the waiting period begins when the last of its replica keys is deleted. Otherwise, the waiting period begins immediately.

  **Examples**

  The following example schedules the specified KMS key for deletion.
  ::

    response = client.schedule_key_deletion(
        # The identifier of the KMS key to schedule for deletion. You can use the key ID or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the KMS key.
        KeyId='1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab',
