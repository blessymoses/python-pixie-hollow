.. py:method:: KMS.Client.create_grant(**kwargs)

  

  Adds a grant to a KMS key.

   

  A *grant* is a policy instrument that allows Amazon Web Services principals to use KMS keys in cryptographic operations. It also can allow them to view a KMS key (  DescribeKey) and create and manage grants. When authorizing access to a KMS key, grants are considered along with key policies and IAM policies. Grants are often used for temporary permissions because you can create one, use its permissions, and delete it without changing your key policies or IAM policies.

   

  For detailed information about grants, including grant terminology, see `Grants in KMS <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/grants.html>`__ in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide* . For examples of creating grants in several programming languages, see `Use CreateGrant with an Amazon Web Services SDK or CLI <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/example_kms_CreateGrant_section.html>`__.

   

  The ``CreateGrant`` operation returns a ``GrantToken`` and a ``GrantId``.

   

  
  * When you create, retire, or revoke a grant, there might be a brief delay, usually less than five minutes, until the grant is available throughout KMS. This state is known as *eventual consistency*. Once the grant has achieved eventual consistency, the grantee principal can use the permissions in the grant without identifying the grant. However, to use the permissions in the grant immediately, use the ``GrantToken`` that ``CreateGrant`` returns. For details, see `Using a grant token <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/using-grant-token.html>`__ in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide* .
   
  * The ``CreateGrant`` operation also returns a ``GrantId``. You can use the ``GrantId`` and a key identifier to identify the grant in the  RetireGrant and  RevokeGrant operations. To find the grant ID, use the  ListGrants or  ListRetirableGrants operations.
  

   

  The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see `Key states of KMS keys <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html>`__ in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

   

  **Cross-account use**: Yes. To perform this operation on a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account, specify the key ARN in the value of the ``KeyId`` parameter.

   

  **Required permissions**: `kms\:CreateGrant <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-api-permissions-reference.html>`__ (key policy)

   

  **Related operations:**

   

  
  *  ListGrants
   
  *  ListRetirableGrants
   
  *  RetireGrant
   
  *  RevokeGrant
  

   

  **Eventual consistency**: The KMS API follows an eventual consistency model. For more information, see `KMS eventual consistency <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/accessing-kms.html#programming-eventual-consistency>`__.

        ],
        Name='string',
        DryRun=True|False
    )
    
  :type KeyId: string
  :param KeyId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Identifies the KMS key for the grant. The grant gives principals permission to use this KMS key.

     

    Specify the key ID or key ARN of the KMS key. To specify a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account, you must use the key ARN.

     

    For example:

     

    
    * Key ID: ``1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab``
     
    * Key ARN: ``arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab``
    

     

    To get the key ID and key ARN for a KMS key, use  ListKeys or  DescribeKey.

    

  
  :type GranteePrincipal: string
  :param GranteePrincipal: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The identity that gets the permissions specified in the grant.

     

    To specify the grantee principal, use the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Amazon Web Services principal. Valid principals include Amazon Web Services accounts, IAM users, IAM roles, federated users, and assumed role users. For help with the ARN syntax for a principal, see `IAM ARNs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_identifiers.html#identifiers-arns>`__ in the *Identity and Access Management User Guide* .

    

  
  :type RetiringPrincipal: string
  :param RetiringPrincipal: 

    The principal that has permission to use the  RetireGrant operation to retire the grant.

     

    To specify the principal, use the `Amazon Resource Name (ARN) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html>`__ of an Amazon Web Services principal. Valid principals include Amazon Web Services accounts, IAM users, IAM roles, federated users, and assumed role users. For help with the ARN syntax for a principal, see `IAM ARNs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_identifiers.html#identifiers-arns>`__ in the *Identity and Access Management User Guide* .

     

    The grant determines the retiring principal. Other principals might have permission to retire the grant or revoke the grant. For details, see  RevokeGrant and `Retiring and revoking grants <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/grant-delete.html>`__ in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

    

  
  :type Operations: list
  :param Operations: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A list of operations that the grant permits.

     

    This list must include only operations that are permitted in a grant. Also, the operation must be supported on the KMS key. For example, you cannot create a grant for a symmetric encryption KMS key that allows the  Sign operation, or a grant for an asymmetric KMS key that allows the  GenerateDataKey operation. If you try, KMS returns a ``ValidationError`` exception. For details, see `Grant operations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/grants.html#terms-grant-operations>`__ in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type Constraints: dict
  :param Constraints: 

    Specifies a grant constraint.

     

    .. warning::

       

      Do not include confidential or sensitive information in this field. This field may be displayed in plaintext in CloudTrail logs and other output.

       

     

    KMS supports the ``EncryptionContextEquals`` and ``EncryptionContextSubset`` grant constraints, which allow the permissions in the grant only when the encryption context in the request matches ( ``EncryptionContextEquals``) or includes ( ``EncryptionContextSubset``) the encryption context specified in the constraint.

     

    The encryption context grant constraints are supported only on `grant operations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/grants.html#terms-grant-operations>`__ that include an ``EncryptionContext`` parameter, such as cryptographic operations on symmetric encryption KMS keys. Grants with grant constraints can include the  DescribeKey and  RetireGrant operations, but the constraint doesn't apply to these operations. If a grant with a grant constraint includes the ``CreateGrant`` operation, the constraint requires that any grants created with the ``CreateGrant`` permission have an equally strict or stricter encryption context constraint.

     

    You cannot use an encryption context grant constraint for cryptographic operations with asymmetric KMS keys or HMAC KMS keys. Operations with these keys don't support an encryption context.

     

    Each constraint value can include up to 8 encryption context pairs. The encryption context value in each constraint cannot exceed 384 characters. For information about grant constraints, see `Using grant constraints <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/create-grant-overview.html#grant-constraints>`__ in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*. For more information about encryption context, see `Encryption context <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#encrypt_context>`__ in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

    

  
    - **EncryptionContextSubset** *(dict) --* 

      A list of key-value pairs that must be included in the encryption context of the `cryptographic operation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-cryptography.html#cryptographic-operations>`__ request. The grant allows the cryptographic operation only when the encryption context in the request includes the key-value pairs specified in this constraint, although it can include additional key-value pairs.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
  

    - **EncryptionContextEquals** *(dict) --* 

      A list of key-value pairs that must match the encryption context in the `cryptographic operation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-cryptography.html#cryptographic-operations>`__ request. The grant allows the operation only when the encryption context in the request is the same as the encryption context specified in this constraint.

        - *(string) --* 

        
  

  
  :type GrantTokens: list
  :param GrantTokens: 

    A list of grant tokens.

     

    Use a grant token when your permission to call this operation comes from a new grant that has not yet achieved *eventual consistency*. For more information, see `Grant token <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/grants.html#grant_token>`__ and `Using a grant token <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/using-grant-token.html>`__ in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type Name: string
  :param Name: 

    A friendly name for the grant. Use this value to prevent the unintended creation of duplicate grants when retrying this request.

     

    .. warning::

       

      Do not include confidential or sensitive information in this field. This field may be displayed in plaintext in CloudTrail logs and other output.

       

     

    When this value is absent, all ``CreateGrant`` requests result in a new grant with a unique ``GrantId`` even if all the supplied parameters are identical. This can result in unintended duplicates when you retry the ``CreateGrant`` request.

     

    When this value is present, you can retry a ``CreateGrant`` request with identical parameters; if the grant already exists, the original ``GrantId`` is returned without creating a new grant. Note that the returned grant token is unique with every ``CreateGrant`` request, even when a duplicate ``GrantId`` is returned. All grant tokens for the same grant ID can be used interchangeably.

    

  
  :type DryRun: boolean
  :param DryRun: 

    Checks if your request will succeed. ``DryRun`` is an optional parameter.

     

    To learn more about how to use this parameter, see `Testing your permissions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/testing-permissions.html>`__ in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.
