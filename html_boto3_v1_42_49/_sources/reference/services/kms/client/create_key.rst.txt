.. py:method:: KMS.Client.create_key(**kwargs)

  

  Creates a unique customer managed `KMS key <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#kms-keys>`__ in your Amazon Web Services account and Region. You can use a KMS key in cryptographic operations, such as encryption and signing. Some Amazon Web Services services let you use KMS keys that you create and manage to protect your service resources.

   

  A KMS key is a logical representation of a cryptographic key. In addition to the key material used in cryptographic operations, a KMS key includes metadata, such as the key ID, key policy, creation date, description, and key state.

   

  Use the parameters of ``CreateKey`` to specify the type of KMS key, the source of its key material, its key policy, description, tags, and other properties.

   

  .. note::

    

    KMS has replaced the term *customer master key (CMK)* with *Key Management Service key* and *KMS key*. The concept has not changed. To prevent breaking changes, KMS is keeping some variations of this term.

    

   

  To create different types of KMS keys, use the following guidance:

    Symmetric encryption KMS key  

  By default, ``CreateKey`` creates a symmetric encryption KMS key with key material that KMS generates. This is the basic and most widely used type of KMS key, and provides the best performance.

   

  To create a symmetric encryption KMS key, you don't need to specify any parameters. The default value for ``KeySpec``, ``SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT``, the default value for ``KeyUsage``, ``ENCRYPT_DECRYPT``, and the default value for ``Origin``, ``AWS_KMS``, create a symmetric encryption KMS key with KMS key material.

   

  If you need a key for basic encryption and decryption or you are creating a KMS key to protect your resources in an Amazon Web Services service, create a symmetric encryption KMS key. The key material in a symmetric encryption key never leaves KMS unencrypted. You can use a symmetric encryption KMS key to encrypt and decrypt data up to 4,096 bytes, but they are typically used to generate data keys and data keys pairs. For details, see  GenerateDataKey and  GenerateDataKeyPair.

   

  

    Asymmetric KMS keys  

  To create an asymmetric KMS key, use the ``KeySpec`` parameter to specify the type of key material in the KMS key. Then, use the ``KeyUsage`` parameter to determine whether the KMS key will be used to encrypt and decrypt or sign and verify. You can't change these properties after the KMS key is created.

   

  Asymmetric KMS keys contain an RSA key pair, Elliptic Curve (ECC) key pair, ML-DSA key pair or an SM2 key pair (China Regions only). The private key in an asymmetric KMS key never leaves KMS unencrypted. However, you can use the  GetPublicKey operation to download the public key so it can be used outside of KMS. Each KMS key can have only one key usage. KMS keys with RSA key pairs can be used to encrypt and decrypt data or sign and verify messages (but not both). KMS keys with NIST-standard ECC key pairs can be used to sign and verify messages or derive shared secrets (but not both). KMS keys with ``ECC_SECG_P256K1`` can be used only to sign and verify messages. KMS keys with ML-DSA key pairs can be used to sign and verify messages. KMS keys with SM2 key pairs (China Regions only) can be used to either encrypt and decrypt data, sign and verify messages, or derive shared secrets (you must choose one key usage type). For information about asymmetric KMS keys, see `Asymmetric KMS keys <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html>`__ in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

   

  

    HMAC KMS key  

  To create an HMAC KMS key, set the ``KeySpec`` parameter to a key spec value for HMAC KMS keys. Then set the ``KeyUsage`` parameter to ``GENERATE_VERIFY_MAC``. You must set the key usage even though ``GENERATE_VERIFY_MAC`` is the only valid key usage value for HMAC KMS keys. You can't change these properties after the KMS key is created.

   

  HMAC KMS keys are symmetric keys that never leave KMS unencrypted. You can use HMAC keys to generate (  GenerateMac) and verify (  VerifyMac) HMAC codes for messages up to 4096 bytes.

   

  

    Multi-Region primary keys Imported key material  

  To create a multi-Region *primary key* in the local Amazon Web Services Region, use the ``MultiRegion`` parameter with a value of ``True``. To create a multi-Region *replica key*, that is, a KMS key with the same key ID and key material as a primary key, but in a different Amazon Web Services Region, use the  ReplicateKey operation. To change a replica key to a primary key, and its primary key to a replica key, use the  UpdatePrimaryRegion operation.

   

  You can create multi-Region KMS keys for all supported KMS key types: symmetric encryption KMS keys, HMAC KMS keys, asymmetric encryption KMS keys, and asymmetric signing KMS keys. You can also create multi-Region keys with imported key material. However, you can't create multi-Region keys in a custom key store.

   

  This operation supports *multi-Region keys*, an KMS feature that lets you create multiple interoperable KMS keys in different Amazon Web Services Regions. Because these KMS keys have the same key ID, key material, and other metadata, you can use them interchangeably to encrypt data in one Amazon Web Services Region and decrypt it in a different Amazon Web Services Region without re-encrypting the data or making a cross-Region call. For more information about multi-Region keys, see `Multi-Region keys in KMS <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html>`__ in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

   

  

     

  To import your own key material into a KMS key, begin by creating a KMS key with no key material. To do this, use the ``Origin`` parameter of ``CreateKey`` with a value of ``EXTERNAL``. Next, use  GetParametersForImport operation to get a public key and import token. Use the wrapping public key to encrypt your key material. Then, use  ImportKeyMaterial with your import token to import the key material. For step-by-step instructions, see `Importing Key Material <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/importing-keys.html>`__ in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

   

  You can import key material into KMS keys of all supported KMS key types: symmetric encryption KMS keys, HMAC KMS keys, asymmetric encryption KMS keys, and asymmetric signing KMS keys. You can also create multi-Region keys with imported key material. However, you can't import key material into a KMS key in a custom key store.

   

  To create a multi-Region primary key with imported key material, use the ``Origin`` parameter of ``CreateKey`` with a value of ``EXTERNAL`` and the ``MultiRegion`` parameter with a value of ``True``. To create replicas of the multi-Region primary key, use the  ReplicateKey operation. For instructions, see `Importing key material step 1 <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/importing-keys-create-cmk.html>`__. For more information about multi-Region keys, see `Multi-Region keys in KMS <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html>`__ in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

   

  

    Custom key store  

  A `custom key store <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-store-overview.html>`__ lets you protect your Amazon Web Services resources using keys in a backing key store that you own and manage. When you request a cryptographic operation with a KMS key in a custom key store, the operation is performed in the backing key store using its cryptographic keys.

   

  KMS supports `CloudHSM key stores <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/keystore-cloudhsm.html>`__ backed by an CloudHSM cluster and `external key stores <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/keystore-external.html>`__ backed by an external key manager outside of Amazon Web Services. When you create a KMS key in an CloudHSM key store, KMS generates an encryption key in the CloudHSM cluster and associates it with the KMS key. When you create a KMS key in an external key store, you specify an existing encryption key in the external key manager.

   

  .. note::

    

    Some external key managers provide a simpler method for creating a KMS key in an external key store. For details, see your external key manager documentation.

    

   

  Before you create a KMS key in a custom key store, the ``ConnectionState`` of the key store must be ``CONNECTED``. To connect the custom key store, use the  ConnectCustomKeyStore operation. To find the ``ConnectionState``, use the  DescribeCustomKeyStores operation.

   

  To create a KMS key in a custom key store, use the ``CustomKeyStoreId``. Use the default ``KeySpec`` value, ``SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT``, and the default ``KeyUsage`` value, ``ENCRYPT_DECRYPT`` to create a symmetric encryption key. No other key type is supported in a custom key store.

   

  To create a KMS key in an `CloudHSM key store <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/create-cmk-keystore.html>`__, use the ``Origin`` parameter with a value of ``AWS_CLOUDHSM``. The CloudHSM cluster that is associated with the custom key store must have at least two active HSMs in different Availability Zones in the Amazon Web Services Region.

   

  To create a KMS key in an `external key store <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/create-xks-keys.html>`__, use the ``Origin`` parameter with a value of ``EXTERNAL_KEY_STORE`` and an ``XksKeyId`` parameter that identifies an existing external key.

   

  .. note::

    

    Some external key managers provide a simpler method for creating a KMS key in an external key store. For details, see your external key manager documentation.

    

     

  **Cross-account use**: No. You cannot use this operation to create a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account.

   

  **Required permissions**: `kms\:CreateKey <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-api-permissions-reference.html>`__ (IAM policy). To use the ``Tags`` parameter, `kms\:TagResource <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-api-permissions-reference.html>`__ (IAM policy). For examples and information about related permissions, see `Allow a user to create KMS keys <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/customer-managed-policies.html#iam-policy-example-create-key>`__ in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

  :type Policy: string
  :param Policy: 

    The key policy to attach to the KMS key.

     

    If you provide a key policy, it must meet the following criteria:

     

    
    * The key policy must allow the calling principal to make a subsequent ``PutKeyPolicy`` request on the KMS key. This reduces the risk that the KMS key becomes unmanageable. For more information, see `Default key policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policy-default.html#prevent-unmanageable-key>`__ in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*. (To omit this condition, set ``BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck`` to true.)
     
    * Each statement in the key policy must contain one or more principals. The principals in the key policy must exist and be visible to KMS. When you create a new Amazon Web Services principal, you might need to enforce a delay before including the new principal in a key policy because the new principal might not be immediately visible to KMS. For more information, see `Changes that I make are not always immediately visible <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/troubleshoot_general.html#troubleshoot_general_eventual-consistency>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management User Guide*.
    

     

    .. note::

      

      If either of the required ``Resource`` or ``Action`` elements are missing from a key policy statement, the policy statement has no effect. When a key policy statement is missing one of these elements, the KMS console correctly reports an error, but the ``CreateKey`` and ``PutKeyPolicy`` API requests succeed, even though the policy statement is ineffective.

       

      For more information on required key policy elements, see `Elements in a key policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policy-overview.html#key-policy-elements>`__ in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

      

     

    If you do not provide a key policy, KMS attaches a default key policy to the KMS key. For more information, see `Default key policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policy-default.html>`__ in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

     

    .. note::

      

      If the key policy exceeds the length constraint, KMS returns a ``LimitExceededException``.

      

     

    For help writing and formatting a JSON policy document, see the `IAM JSON Policy Reference <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies.html>`__ in the *Identity and Access Management User Guide* .

    

  
  :type Description: string
  :param Description: 

    A description of the KMS key. Use a description that helps you decide whether the KMS key is appropriate for a task. The default value is an empty string (no description).

     

    .. warning::

       

      Do not include confidential or sensitive information in this field. This field may be displayed in plaintext in CloudTrail logs and other output.

       

     

    To set or change the description after the key is created, use  UpdateKeyDescription.

    

  
  :type KeyUsage: string
  :param KeyUsage: 

    Determines the `cryptographic operations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-cryptography.html#cryptographic-operations>`__ for which you can use the KMS key. The default value is ``ENCRYPT_DECRYPT``. This parameter is optional when you are creating a symmetric encryption KMS key; otherwise, it is required. You can't change the `KeyUsage <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/create-keys.html#key-usage>`__ value after the KMS key is created. Each KMS key can have only one key usage. This follows key usage best practices according to `NIST SP 800-57 Recommendations for Key Management <https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/57/pt1/r5/final>`__, section 5.2, Key usage.

     

    Select only one valid value.

     

    
    * For symmetric encryption KMS keys, omit the parameter or specify ``ENCRYPT_DECRYPT``.
     
    * For HMAC KMS keys (symmetric), specify ``GENERATE_VERIFY_MAC``.
     
    * For asymmetric KMS keys with RSA key pairs, specify ``ENCRYPT_DECRYPT`` or ``SIGN_VERIFY``.
     
    * For asymmetric KMS keys with NIST-standard elliptic curve key pairs, specify ``SIGN_VERIFY`` or ``KEY_AGREEMENT``.
     
    * For asymmetric KMS keys with ``ECC_SECG_P256K1`` key pairs, specify ``SIGN_VERIFY``.
     
    * For asymmetric KMS keys with ML-DSA key pairs, specify ``SIGN_VERIFY``.
     
    * For asymmetric KMS keys with SM2 key pairs (China Regions only), specify ``ENCRYPT_DECRYPT``, ``SIGN_VERIFY``, or ``KEY_AGREEMENT``.
    

    

  
  :type CustomerMasterKeySpec: string
  :param CustomerMasterKeySpec: 

    Instead, use the ``KeySpec`` parameter.

     

    The ``KeySpec`` and ``CustomerMasterKeySpec`` parameters work the same way. Only the names differ. We recommend that you use ``KeySpec`` parameter in your code. However, to avoid breaking changes, KMS supports both parameters.

    

  
  :type KeySpec: string
  :param KeySpec: 

    Specifies the type of KMS key to create. The default value, ``SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT``, creates a KMS key with a 256-bit AES-GCM key that is used for encryption and decryption, except in China Regions, where it creates a 128-bit symmetric key that uses SM4 encryption. For a detailed description of all supported key specs, see `Key spec reference <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symm-asymm-choose-key-spec.html>`__ in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

     

    The ``KeySpec`` determines whether the KMS key contains a symmetric key or an asymmetric key pair. It also determines the algorithms that the KMS key supports. You can't change the ``KeySpec`` after the KMS key is created. To further restrict the algorithms that can be used with the KMS key, use a condition key in its key policy or IAM policy. For more information, see `kms\:EncryptionAlgorithm <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/conditions-kms.html#conditions-kms-encryption-algorithm>`__, `kms\:MacAlgorithm <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/conditions-kms.html#conditions-kms-mac-algorithm>`__, `kms\:KeyAgreementAlgorithm <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/conditions-kms.html#conditions-kms-key-agreement-algorithm>`__, or `kms\:SigningAlgorithm <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/conditions-kms.html#conditions-kms-signing-algorithm>`__ in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide* .

     

    .. warning::

       

      `Amazon Web Services services that are integrated with KMS <http://aws.amazon.com/kms/features/#AWS_Service_Integration>`__ use symmetric encryption KMS keys to protect your data. These services do not support asymmetric KMS keys or HMAC KMS keys.

       

     

    KMS supports the following key specs for KMS keys:

      * ``ECC_NIST_EDWARDS25519`` (ed25519) - signing and verification only 

        
        * **Note:** For ECC_NIST_EDWARDS25519 KMS keys, the ED25519_SHA_512 signing algorithm requires `MessageType\:RAW <kms/latest/APIReference/API_Sign.html#KMS-Sign-request-MessageType>`__, while ED25519_PH_SHA_512 requires `MessageType\:DIGEST <kms/latest/APIReference/API_Sign.html#KMS-Sign-request-MessageType>`__. These message types cannot be used interchangeably.

      * ``SM2`` (China Regions only)
      

    
    

    

  
  :type Origin: string
  :param Origin: 

    The source of the key material for the KMS key. You cannot change the origin after you create the KMS key. The default is ``AWS_KMS``, which means that KMS creates the key material.

     

    To `create a KMS key with no key material <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/importing-keys-create-cmk.html>`__ (for imported key material), set this value to ``EXTERNAL``. For more information about importing key material into KMS, see `Importing Key Material <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/importing-keys.html>`__ in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*. The ``EXTERNAL`` origin value is valid only for symmetric KMS keys.

     

    To `create a KMS key in an CloudHSM key store <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/create-cmk-keystore.html>`__ and create its key material in the associated CloudHSM cluster, set this value to ``AWS_CLOUDHSM``. You must also use the ``CustomKeyStoreId`` parameter to identify the CloudHSM key store. The ``KeySpec`` value must be ``SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT``.

     

    To `create a KMS key in an external key store <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/create-xks-keys.html>`__, set this value to ``EXTERNAL_KEY_STORE``. You must also use the ``CustomKeyStoreId`` parameter to identify the external key store and the ``XksKeyId`` parameter to identify the associated external key. The ``KeySpec`` value must be ``SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT``.

    

  
  :type CustomKeyStoreId: string
  :param CustomKeyStoreId: 

    Creates the KMS key in the specified `custom key store <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-store-overview.html>`__. The ``ConnectionState`` of the custom key store must be ``CONNECTED``. To find the CustomKeyStoreID and ConnectionState use the  DescribeCustomKeyStores operation.

     

    This parameter is valid only for symmetric encryption KMS keys in a single Region. You cannot create any other type of KMS key in a custom key store.

     

    When you create a KMS key in an CloudHSM key store, KMS generates a non-exportable 256-bit symmetric key in its associated CloudHSM cluster and associates it with the KMS key. When you create a KMS key in an external key store, you must use the ``XksKeyId`` parameter to specify an external key that serves as key material for the KMS key.

    

  
  :type BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck: boolean
  :param BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck: 

    Skips ("bypasses") the key policy lockout safety check. The default value is false.

     

    .. warning::

       

      Setting this value to true increases the risk that the KMS key becomes unmanageable. Do not set this value to true indiscriminately.

       

      For more information, see `Default key policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policy-default.html#prevent-unmanageable-key>`__ in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

       

     

    Use this parameter only when you intend to prevent the principal that is making the request from making a subsequent `PutKeyPolicy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_PutKeyPolicy.html>`__ request on the KMS key.

    

  
  :type Tags: list
  :param Tags: 

    Assigns one or more tags to the KMS key. Use this parameter to tag the KMS key when it is created. To tag an existing KMS key, use the  TagResource operation.

     

    .. warning::

       

      Do not include confidential or sensitive information in this field. This field may be displayed in plaintext in CloudTrail logs and other output.

       

     

    .. note::

      

      Tagging or untagging a KMS key can allow or deny permission to the KMS key. For details, see `ABAC for KMS <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/abac.html>`__ in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

      

     

    To use this parameter, you must have `kms\:TagResource <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-api-permissions-reference.html>`__ permission in an IAM policy.

     

    Each tag consists of a tag key and a tag value. Both the tag key and the tag value are required, but the tag value can be an empty (null) string. You cannot have more than one tag on a KMS key with the same tag key. If you specify an existing tag key with a different tag value, KMS replaces the current tag value with the specified one.

     

    When you add tags to an Amazon Web Services resource, Amazon Web Services generates a cost allocation report with usage and costs aggregated by tags. Tags can also be used to control access to a KMS key. For details, see `Tags in KMS <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/tagging-keys.html>`__.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      A key-value pair. A tag consists of a tag key and a tag value. Tag keys and tag values are both required, but tag values can be empty (null) strings.

       

      .. warning::

         

        Do not include confidential or sensitive information in this field. This field may be displayed in plaintext in CloudTrail logs and other output.

         

       

      For information about the rules that apply to tag keys and tag values, see `User-Defined Tag Restrictions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/allocation-tag-restrictions.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services Billing and Cost Management User Guide*.

        The key of the tag.

        

      
      - **TagValue** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The value of the tag.

        

      
    

  :type MultiRegion: boolean
  :param MultiRegion: 

    Creates a multi-Region primary key that you can replicate into other Amazon Web Services Regions. You cannot change this value after you create the KMS key.

     

    For a multi-Region key, set this parameter to ``True``. For a single-Region KMS key, omit this parameter or set it to ``False``. The default value is ``False``.

     

    This operation supports *multi-Region keys*, an KMS feature that lets you create multiple interoperable KMS keys in different Amazon Web Services Regions. Because these KMS keys have the same key ID, key material, and other metadata, you can use them interchangeably to encrypt data in one Amazon Web Services Region and decrypt it in a different Amazon Web Services Region without re-encrypting the data or making a cross-Region call. For more information about multi-Region keys, see `Multi-Region keys in KMS <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html>`__ in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

     

    This value creates a *primary key*, not a replica. To create a *replica key*, use the  ReplicateKey operation.

     

    You can create a symmetric or asymmetric multi-Region key, and you can create a multi-Region key with imported key material. However, you cannot create a multi-Region key in a custom key store.

    

  
  :type XksKeyId: string
  :param XksKeyId: 

    Identifies the `external key <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/keystore-external.html#concept-external-key>`__ that serves as key material for the KMS key in an `external key store <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/keystore-external.html>`__. Specify the ID that the `external key store proxy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/keystore-external.html#concept-xks-proxy>`__ uses to refer to the external key. For help, see the documentation for your external key store proxy.

     

    This parameter is required for a KMS key with an ``Origin`` value of ``EXTERNAL_KEY_STORE``. It is not valid for KMS keys with any other ``Origin`` value.

     

    The external key must be an existing 256-bit AES symmetric encryption key hosted outside of Amazon Web Services in an external key manager associated with the external key store specified by the ``CustomKeyStoreId`` parameter. This key must be enabled and configured to perform encryption and decryption. Each KMS key in an external key store must use a different external key. For details, see `Requirements for a KMS key in an external key store <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/create-xks-keys.html#xks-key-requirements>`__ in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

     

    Each KMS key in an external key store is associated two backing keys. One is key material that KMS generates. The other is the external key specified by this parameter. When you use the KMS key in an external key store to encrypt data, the encryption operation is performed first by KMS using the KMS key material, and then by the external key manager using the specified external key, a process known as *double encryption*. For details, see `Double encryption <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/keystore-external.html#concept-double-encryption>`__ in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

        - **KeyState** *(string) --* 

          The current status of the KMS key.

           

          For more information about how key state affects the use of a KMS key, see `Key states of KMS keys <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html>`__ in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

          
        

        - **DeletionDate** *(datetime) --* 

          The date and time after which KMS deletes this KMS key. This value is present only when the KMS key is scheduled for deletion, that is, when its ``KeyState`` is ``PendingDeletion``.

           

          When the primary key in a multi-Region key is scheduled for deletion but still has replica keys, its key state is ``PendingReplicaDeletion`` and the length of its waiting period is displayed in the ``PendingDeletionWindowInDays`` field.

          
        

        - **ValidTo** *(datetime) --* 

          The earliest time at which any imported key material permanently associated with this KMS key expires. When a key material expires, KMS deletes the key material and the KMS key becomes unusable. This value is present only for KMS keys whose ``Origin`` is ``EXTERNAL`` and the ``ExpirationModel`` is ``KEY_MATERIAL_EXPIRES``, otherwise this value is omitted.

          
        

        - **Origin** *(string) --* 

          The source of the key material for the KMS key. When this value is ``AWS_KMS``, KMS created the key material. When this value is ``EXTERNAL``, the key material was imported or the KMS key doesn't have any key material. When this value is ``AWS_CLOUDHSM``, the key material was created in the CloudHSM cluster associated with a custom key store.

          
        

        - **CustomKeyStoreId** *(string) --* 

          A unique identifier for the `custom key store <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-store-overview.html>`__ that contains the KMS key. This field is present only when the KMS key is created in a custom key store.

          
        

        - **CloudHsmClusterId** *(string) --* 

          The cluster ID of the CloudHSM cluster that contains the key material for the KMS key. When you create a KMS key in an CloudHSM `custom key store <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-store-overview.html>`__, KMS creates the key material for the KMS key in the associated CloudHSM cluster. This field is present only when the KMS key is created in an CloudHSM key store.

          
        

        - **ExpirationModel** *(string) --* 

          Specifies whether the KMS key's key material expires. This value is present only when ``Origin`` is ``EXTERNAL``, otherwise this value is omitted.

          
        

        - **KeyManager** *(string) --* 

          The manager of the KMS key. KMS keys in your Amazon Web Services account are either customer managed or Amazon Web Services managed. For more information about the difference, see `KMS keys <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#kms_keys>`__ in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

          
        

        - **CustomerMasterKeySpec** *(string) --* 

          Instead, use the ``KeySpec`` field.

           

          The ``KeySpec`` and ``CustomerMasterKeySpec`` fields have the same value. We recommend that you use the ``KeySpec`` field in your code. However, to avoid breaking changes, KMS supports both fields.

          
        

        - **KeySpec** *(string) --* 

          Describes the type of key material in the KMS key.

          
        

        - **EncryptionAlgorithms** *(list) --* 

          The encryption algorithms that the KMS key supports. You cannot use the KMS key with other encryption algorithms within KMS.

           

          This value is present only when the ``KeyUsage`` of the KMS key is ``ENCRYPT_DECRYPT``.

          
          

          - *(string) --* 
      
        

        - **SigningAlgorithms** *(list) --* 

          The signing algorithms that the KMS key supports. You cannot use the KMS key with other signing algorithms within KMS.

           

          This field appears only when the ``KeyUsage`` of the KMS key is ``SIGN_VERIFY``.

          
          

          - *(string) --* 
      
        

        - **KeyAgreementAlgorithms** *(list) --* 

          The key agreement algorithm used to derive a shared secret.

          
          

          - *(string) --* 
      
        

        - **MultiRegion** *(boolean) --* 

          Indicates whether the KMS key is a multi-Region ( ``True``) or regional ( ``False``) key. This value is ``True`` for multi-Region primary and replica keys and ``False`` for regional KMS keys.

           

          For more information about multi-Region keys, see `Multi-Region keys in KMS <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html>`__ in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

          
        

        - **MultiRegionConfiguration** *(dict) --* 

          Lists the primary and replica keys in same multi-Region key. This field is present only when the value of the ``MultiRegion`` field is ``True``.

           

          For more information about any listed KMS key, use the  DescribeKey operation.

           

          
          * ``MultiRegionKeyType`` indicates whether the KMS key is a ``PRIMARY`` or ``REPLICA`` key.
           
          * ``PrimaryKey`` displays the key ARN and Region of the primary key. This field displays the current KMS key if it is the primary key.
           
          * ``ReplicaKeys`` displays the key ARNs and Regions of all replica keys. This field includes the current KMS key if it is a replica key.
          

          
          

          - **MultiRegionKeyType** *(string) --* 

            Indicates whether the KMS key is a ``PRIMARY`` or ``REPLICA`` key.

            
          

          - **PrimaryKey** *(dict) --* 

            Displays the key ARN and Region of the primary key. This field includes the current KMS key if it is the primary key.

            
            

            - **Arn** *(string) --* 

              Displays the key ARN of a primary or replica key of a multi-Region key.

              
            

            - **Region** *(string) --* 

              Displays the Amazon Web Services Region of a primary or replica key in a multi-Region key.

              
        
          

          - **ReplicaKeys** *(list) --* 

            displays the key ARNs and Regions of all replica keys. This field includes the current KMS key if it is a replica key.

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

              Describes the primary or replica key in a multi-Region key.

              
              

              - **Arn** *(string) --* 

                Displays the key ARN of a primary or replica key of a multi-Region key.

                
              

              - **Region** *(string) --* 

                Displays the Amazon Web Services Region of a primary or replica key in a multi-Region key.

                
          
        
      
        

        - **PendingDeletionWindowInDays** *(integer) --* 

          The waiting period before the primary key in a multi-Region key is deleted. This waiting period begins when the last of its replica keys is deleted. This value is present only when the ``KeyState`` of the KMS key is ``PendingReplicaDeletion``. That indicates that the KMS key is the primary key in a multi-Region key, it is scheduled for deletion, and it still has existing replica keys.

           

          When a single-Region KMS key or a multi-Region replica key is scheduled for deletion, its deletion date is displayed in the ``DeletionDate`` field. However, when the primary key in a multi-Region key is scheduled for deletion, its waiting period doesn't begin until all of its replica keys are deleted. This value displays that waiting period. When the last replica key in the multi-Region key is deleted, the ``KeyState`` of the scheduled primary key changes from ``PendingReplicaDeletion`` to ``PendingDeletion`` and the deletion date appears in the ``DeletionDate`` field.

          
        

        - **MacAlgorithms** *(list) --* 

          The message authentication code (MAC) algorithm that the HMAC KMS key supports.

           

          This value is present only when the ``KeyUsage`` of the KMS key is ``GENERATE_VERIFY_MAC``.

          
          

          - *(string) --* 
      
        

        - **XksKeyConfiguration** *(dict) --* 

          Information about the external key that is associated with a KMS key in an external key store.

           

          For more information, see `External key <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/keystore-external.html#concept-external-key>`__ in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

          
          

          - **Id** *(string) --* 

            The ID of the external key in its external key manager. This is the ID that the external key store proxy uses to identify the external key.

            
      
        

        - **CurrentKeyMaterialId** *(string) --* 

          Identifies the current key material. This value is present for symmetric encryption keys with ``AWS_KMS`` or ``EXTERNAL`` origin. These KMS keys support automatic or on-demand key rotation and can have multiple key materials associated with them. KMS uses the current key material for both encryption and decryption, and the non-current key material for decryption operations only.
