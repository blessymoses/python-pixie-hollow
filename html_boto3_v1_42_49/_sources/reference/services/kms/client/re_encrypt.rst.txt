.. py:method:: KMS.Client.re_encrypt(**kwargs)

  

  Decrypts ciphertext and then reencrypts it entirely within KMS. You can use this operation to change the KMS key under which data is encrypted, such as when you `manually rotate <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/rotate-keys-manually.html>`__ a KMS key or change the KMS key that protects a ciphertext. You can also use it to reencrypt ciphertext under the same KMS key, such as to change the `encryption context <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/encrypt_context.html>`__ of a ciphertext.

   

  The ``ReEncrypt`` operation can decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted by using a KMS key in an KMS operation, such as  Encrypt or  GenerateDataKey. It can also decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted by using the public key of an `asymmetric KMS key <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html>`__ outside of KMS. However, it cannot decrypt ciphertext produced by other libraries, such as the `Amazon Web Services Encryption SDK <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/>`__ or `Amazon S3 client-side encryption <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingClientSideEncryption.html>`__. These libraries return a ciphertext format that is incompatible with KMS.

   

  When you use the ``ReEncrypt`` operation, you need to provide information for the decrypt operation and the subsequent encrypt operation.

   

  
  * If your ciphertext was encrypted under an asymmetric KMS key, you must use the ``SourceKeyId`` parameter to identify the KMS key that encrypted the ciphertext. You must also supply the encryption algorithm that was used. This information is required to decrypt the data.
   
  * If your ciphertext was encrypted under a symmetric encryption KMS key, the ``SourceKeyId`` parameter is optional. KMS can get this information from metadata that it adds to the symmetric ciphertext blob. This feature adds durability to your implementation by ensuring that authorized users can decrypt ciphertext decades after it was encrypted, even if they've lost track of the key ID. However, specifying the source KMS key is always recommended as a best practice. When you use the ``SourceKeyId`` parameter to specify a KMS key, KMS uses only the KMS key you specify. If the ciphertext was encrypted under a different KMS key, the ``ReEncrypt`` operation fails. This practice ensures that you use the KMS key that you intend.
   
  * To reencrypt the data, you must use the ``DestinationKeyId`` parameter to specify the KMS key that re-encrypts the data after it is decrypted. If the destination KMS key is an asymmetric KMS key, you must also provide the encryption algorithm. The algorithm that you choose must be compatible with the KMS key. 

  .. warning::

    When you use an asymmetric KMS key to encrypt or reencrypt data, be sure to record the KMS key and encryption algorithm that you choose. You will be required to provide the same KMS key and encryption algorithm when you decrypt the data. If the KMS key and algorithm do not match the values used to encrypt the data, the decrypt operation fails. You are not required to supply the key ID and encryption algorithm when you decrypt with symmetric encryption KMS keys because KMS stores this information in the ciphertext blob. KMS cannot store metadata in ciphertext generated with asymmetric keys. The standard format for asymmetric key ciphertext does not include configurable fields.

  
  

   

  The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see `Key states of KMS keys <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html>`__ in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

   

  **Cross-account use**: Yes. The source KMS key and destination KMS key can be in different Amazon Web Services accounts. Either or both KMS keys can be in a different account than the caller. To specify a KMS key in a different account, you must use its key ARN or alias ARN.

   

  **Required permissions**:

   

  
  * `kms\:ReEncryptFrom <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-api-permissions-reference.html>`__ permission on the source KMS key (key policy)
   
  * `kms\:ReEncryptTo <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-api-permissions-reference.html>`__ permission on the destination KMS key (key policy)
  

   

  To permit reencryption from or to a KMS key, include the ``"kms:ReEncrypt*"`` permission in your `key policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html>`__. This permission is automatically included in the key policy when you use the console to create a KMS key. But you must include it manually when you create a KMS key programmatically or when you use the  PutKeyPolicy operation to set a key policy.

  *  Encrypt
   
  *  GenerateDataKey
   
  *  GenerateDataKeyPair
  

   

  **Eventual consistency**: The KMS API follows an eventual consistency model. For more information, see `KMS eventual consistency <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/accessing-kms.html#programming-eventual-consistency>`__.

  :type CiphertextBlob: bytes
  :param CiphertextBlob: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Ciphertext of the data to reencrypt.

    

  
  :type SourceEncryptionContext: dict
  :param SourceEncryptionContext: 

    Specifies the encryption context to use to decrypt the ciphertext. Enter the same encryption context that was used to encrypt the ciphertext.

     

    An *encryption context* is a collection of non-secret key-value pairs that represent additional authenticated data. When you use an encryption context to encrypt data, you must specify the same (an exact case-sensitive match) encryption context to decrypt the data. An encryption context is supported only on operations with symmetric encryption KMS keys. On operations with symmetric encryption KMS keys, an encryption context is optional, but it is strongly recommended.

     

    For more information, see `Encryption context <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/encrypt_context.html>`__ in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

  :type SourceKeyId: string
  :param SourceKeyId: 

    Specifies the KMS key that KMS will use to decrypt the ciphertext before it is re-encrypted.

     

    Enter a key ID of the KMS key that was used to encrypt the ciphertext. If you identify a different KMS key, the ``ReEncrypt`` operation throws an ``IncorrectKeyException``.

     

    This parameter is required only when the ciphertext was encrypted under an asymmetric KMS key. If you used a symmetric encryption KMS key, KMS can get the KMS key from metadata that it adds to the symmetric ciphertext blob. However, it is always recommended as a best practice. This practice ensures that you use the KMS key that you intend.

     

    To specify a KMS key, use its key ID, key ARN, alias name, or alias ARN. When using an alias name, prefix it with ``"alias/"``. To specify a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account, you must use the key ARN or alias ARN.

     

    For example:

     

    
    * Key ID: ``1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab``
     
    * Key ARN: ``arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab``
     
    * Alias name: ``alias/ExampleAlias``
     
    * Alias ARN: ``arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias``
    

     

    To get the key ID and key ARN for a KMS key, use  ListKeys or  DescribeKey. To get the alias name and alias ARN, use  ListAliases.

    

  
  :type DestinationKeyId: string
  :param DestinationKeyId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A unique identifier for the KMS key that is used to reencrypt the data. Specify a symmetric encryption KMS key or an asymmetric KMS key with a ``KeyUsage`` value of ``ENCRYPT_DECRYPT``. To find the ``KeyUsage`` value of a KMS key, use the  DescribeKey operation.

     

    To specify a KMS key, use its key ID, key ARN, alias name, or alias ARN. When using an alias name, prefix it with ``"alias/"``. To specify a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account, you must use the key ARN or alias ARN.

     

    For example:

     

    
    * Key ID: ``1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab``
     
    * Key ARN: ``arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab``
     
    * Alias name: ``alias/ExampleAlias``
     
    * Alias ARN: ``arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias``
    

     

    To get the key ID and key ARN for a KMS key, use  ListKeys or  DescribeKey. To get the alias name and alias ARN, use  ListAliases.

    

  
  :type DestinationEncryptionContext: dict
  :param DestinationEncryptionContext: 

    Specifies that encryption context to use when the reencrypting the data.

     

    .. warning::

       

      Do not include confidential or sensitive information in this field. This field may be displayed in plaintext in CloudTrail logs and other output.

       

     

    A destination encryption context is valid only when the destination KMS key is a symmetric encryption KMS key. The standard ciphertext format for asymmetric KMS keys does not include fields for metadata.
