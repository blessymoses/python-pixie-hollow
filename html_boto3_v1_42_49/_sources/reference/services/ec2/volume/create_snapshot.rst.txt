.. py:method:: EC2.Volume.create_snapshot(**kwargs)

  

  Creates a snapshot of an EBS volume and stores it in Amazon S3. You can use snapshots for backups, to make copies of EBS volumes, and to save data before shutting down an instance.

   

  The location of the source EBS volume determines where you can create the snapshot.

   

  
  * If the source volume is in a Region, you must create the snapshot in the same Region as the volume.
   
  * If the source volume is in a Local Zone, you can create the snapshot in the same Local Zone or in its parent Amazon Web Services Region.
   
  * If the source volume is on an Outpost, you can create the snapshot on the same Outpost or in its parent Amazon Web Services Region.
  

   

  When a snapshot is created, any Amazon Web Services Marketplace product codes that are associated with the source volume are propagated to the snapshot.

   

  You can take a snapshot of an attached volume that is in use. However, snapshots only capture data that has been written to your Amazon EBS volume at the time the snapshot command is issued; this might exclude any data that has been cached by any applications or the operating system. If you can pause any file systems on the volume long enough to take a snapshot, your snapshot should be complete. However, if you cannot pause all file writes to the volume, you should unmount the volume from within the instance, issue the snapshot command, and then remount the volume to ensure a consistent and complete snapshot. You may remount and use your volume while the snapshot status is ``pending``.

   

  When you create a snapshot for an EBS volume that serves as a root device, we recommend that you stop the instance before taking the snapshot.

   

  Snapshots that are taken from encrypted volumes are automatically encrypted. Volumes that are created from encrypted snapshots are also automatically encrypted. Your encrypted volumes and any associated snapshots always remain protected. For more information, see `Amazon EBS encryption <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-encryption.html>`__ in the *Amazon EBS User Guide*.

  :type Description: string
  :param Description: 

    A description for the snapshot.

    

  
  :type OutpostArn: string
  :param OutpostArn: 

    .. note::

      

      Only supported for volumes on Outposts. If the source volume is not on an Outpost, omit this parameter.

      

     

    
    * To create the snapshot on the same Outpost as the source volume, specify the ARN of that Outpost. The snapshot must be created on the same Outpost as the volume.
     
    * To create the snapshot in the parent Region of the Outpost, omit this parameter.
    

     

    For more information, see `Create local snapshots from volumes on an Outpost <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/snapshots-outposts.html#create-snapshot>`__ in the *Amazon EBS User Guide*.

    

  
  :type TagSpecifications: list
  :param TagSpecifications: 

    The tags to apply to the snapshot during creation.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      The tags to apply to a resource when the resource is being created. When you specify a tag, you must specify the resource type to tag, otherwise the request will fail.

       

      .. note::

        

        The ``Valid Values`` lists all the resource types that can be tagged. However, the action you're using might not support tagging all of these resource types. If you try to tag a resource type that is unsupported for the action you're using, you'll get an error.

        

      

    
      - **ResourceType** *(string) --* 

        The type of resource to tag on creation.

        

      
      - **Tags** *(list) --* 

        The tags to apply to the resource.

        

      
        - *(dict) --* 

          Describes a tag.

          

        
          - **Key** *(string) --* 

            The key of the tag.

             

            Constraints: Tag keys are case-sensitive and accept a maximum of 127 Unicode characters. May not begin with ``aws:``.

            

          
          - **Value** *(string) --* 

            The value of the tag.

             

            Constraints: Tag values are case-sensitive and accept a maximum of 256 Unicode characters.

            

          
        
    
    

  :type Location: string
  :param Location: 

    .. note::

      

      Only supported for volumes in Local Zones. If the source volume is not in a Local Zone, omit this parameter.

      

     

    
    * To create a local snapshot in the same Local Zone as the source volume, specify ``local``.
     
    * To create a regional snapshot in the parent Region of the Local Zone, specify ``regional`` or omit this parameter.
    

     

    Default value: ``regional``

    

  
  :type DryRun: boolean
  :param DryRun: 

    Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is ``DryRunOperation``. Otherwise, it is ``UnauthorizedOperation``.
