  - *(dict) --* 

    The state of VPC Block Public Access (BPA).

    
    

    - **InternetGatewayBlockMode** *(string) --* 

      The mode of VPC BPA.

       

      
      * ``off``: VPC BPA is not enabled and traffic is allowed to and from internet gateways and egress-only internet gateways in this Region.
       
      * ``block-bidirectional``: Block all traffic to and from internet gateways and egress-only internet gateways in this Region (except for excluded VPCs and subnets).
       
      * ``block-ingress``: Block all internet traffic to the VPCs in this Region (except for VPCs or subnets which are excluded). Only traffic to and from NAT gateways and egress-only internet gateways is allowed because these gateways only allow outbound connections to be established.
