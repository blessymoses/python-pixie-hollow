.. py:method:: EC2.Vpc.wait_until_available(**kwargs)

  Waits until this Vpc is available. This method calls :py:meth:`EC2.Waiter.vpc_available.wait` which polls :py:meth:`EC2.Client.describe_vpcs` every 15 seconds until a successful state is reached. An error is raised after 40 failed checks.

  :type Filters: list
  :param Filters: 

    The filters.

     

    
    * ``cidr`` - The primary IPv4 CIDR block of the VPC. The CIDR block you specify must exactly match the VPC's CIDR block for information to be returned for the VPC. Must contain the slash followed by one or two digits (for example, ``/28``).
     
    * ``cidr-block-association.cidr-block`` - An IPv4 CIDR block associated with the VPC.
     
    * ``cidr-block-association.association-id`` - The association ID for an IPv4 CIDR block associated with the VPC.
     
    * ``cidr-block-association.state`` - The state of an IPv4 CIDR block associated with the VPC.
     
    * ``dhcp-options-id`` - The ID of a set of DHCP options.
     
    * ``ipv6-cidr-block-association.ipv6-cidr-block`` - An IPv6 CIDR block associated with the VPC.
     
    * ``ipv6-cidr-block-association.ipv6-pool`` - The ID of the IPv6 address pool from which the IPv6 CIDR block is allocated.
     
    * ``ipv6-cidr-block-association.association-id`` - The association ID for an IPv6 CIDR block associated with the VPC.
     
    * ``ipv6-cidr-block-association.state`` - The state of an IPv6 CIDR block associated with the VPC.
     
    * ``is-default`` - Indicates whether the VPC is the default VPC.
     
    * ``owner-id`` - The ID of the Amazon Web Services account that owns the VPC.
     
    * ``state`` - The state of the VPC ( ``pending`` | ``available``).
     
    * ``tag`` - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key ``Owner`` and the value ``TeamA``, specify ``tag:Owner`` for the filter name and ``TeamA`` for the filter value.
     
    * ``tag-key`` - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, regardless of the tag value.
     
    * ``vpc-id`` - The ID of the VPC.
    

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more specific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be used to match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as tags, attributes, or IDs.

       

      If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an ``AND``, and the request returns only results that match all of the specified filters.

       

      For more information, see `List and filter using the CLI and API <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Filtering.html#Filtering_Resources_CLI>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

      

    
      - **Name** *(string) --* 

        The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

        

      
      - **Values** *(list) --* 

        The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you specify multiple values for a filter, the values are joined with an ``OR``, and the request returns all results that match any of the specified values.

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
    
    

  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    The token returned from a previous paginated request. Pagination continues from the end of the items returned by the previous request.

    

  
  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    The maximum number of items to return for this request. To get the next page of items, make another request with the token returned in the output. For more information, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Query-Requests.html#api-pagination>`__.

    

  
  :type DryRun: boolean
  :param DryRun: 

    Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is ``DryRunOperation``. Otherwise, it is ``UnauthorizedOperation``.
