  Deletes a VPC peering connection. Either the owner of the requester VPC or the owner of the accepter VPC can delete the VPC peering connection if it's in the ``active`` state. The owner of the requester VPC can delete a VPC peering connection in the ``pending-acceptance`` state. You cannot delete a VPC peering connection that's in the ``failed`` or ``rejected`` state.
