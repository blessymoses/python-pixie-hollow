                    The state of the instance as a 16-bit unsigned integer.

                     

                    The high byte is all of the bits between 2^8 and (2^16)-1, which equals decimal values between 256 and 65,535. These numerical values are used for internal purposes and should be ignored.

                     

                    The low byte is all of the bits between 2^0 and (2^8)-1, which equals decimal values between 0 and 255.

                     

                    The valid values for instance-state-code will all be in the range of the low byte and they are:

                     

                    
                    * ``0`` : ``pending``
                     
                    * ``16`` : ``running``
                     
                    * ``32`` : ``shutting-down``
                     
                    * ``48`` : ``terminated``
                     
                    * ``64`` : ``stopping``
                     
                    * ``80`` : ``stopped``
                    

                     

                    You can ignore the high byte value by zeroing out all of the bits above 2^8 or 256 in decimal.

                  The Amazon-provided DNS server resolves Amazon-provided private DNS hostnames if you've enabled DNS resolution and DNS hostnames in your VPC. If you are not using the Amazon-provided DNS server in your VPC, your custom domain name servers must resolve the hostname as appropriate.

                  
                

                - **PublicDnsName** *(string) --*

This name is only available if you've enabled DNS hostnames for your VPC. The format of this name depends on the `public hostname type <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/hostname-types.html#public-hostnames>`__.
