          }
      )
      
    :type RouteServerIds: list
    :param RouteServerIds: 

      The IDs of the route servers to describe.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type Filters: list
    :param Filters: 

      One or more filters to apply to the describe request.

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more specific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be used to match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as tags, attributes, or IDs.

         

        If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an ``AND``, and the request returns only results that match all of the specified filters.

         

        For more information, see `List and filter using the CLI and API <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Filtering.html#Filtering_Resources_CLI>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

        

      
        - **Name** *(string) --* 

          The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

          

        
        - **Values** *(list) --* 

          The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you specify multiple values for a filter, the values are joined with an ``OR``, and the request returns all results that match any of the specified values.

          

        
          - *(string) --* 

          
      
      
  
    :type DryRun: boolean
    :param DryRun: 

      A check for whether you have the required permissions for the action without actually making the request and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is ``DryRunOperation``. Otherwise, it is ``UnauthorizedOperation``.

      

    
    :type PaginationConfig: dict
    :param PaginationConfig: 

      A dictionary that provides parameters to control pagination.

      

    
      - **MaxItems** *(integer) --* 

        The total number of items to return. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified in max-items then a ``NextToken`` will be provided in the output that you can use to resume pagination.

        

      
      - **PageSize** *(integer) --* 

        The size of each page.

        

      
      - **StartingToken** *(string) --* 

        A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previous response.

      **Response Structure**

      

      - *(dict) --* 
        

        - **RouteServers** *(list) --* 

          Information about the described route servers.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            Describes a route server and its configuration.

             

            Amazon VPC Route Server simplifies routing for traffic between workloads that are deployed within a VPC and its internet gateways. With this feature, VPC Route Server dynamically updates VPC and internet gateway route tables with your preferred IPv4 or IPv6 routes to achieve routing fault tolerance for those workloads. This enables you to automatically reroute traffic within a VPC, which increases the manageability of VPC routing and interoperability with third-party workloads.

             

            Route server supports the follow route table types:

             

            
            * VPC route tables not associated with subnets
             
            * Subnet route tables
             
            * Internet gateway route tables
            

             

            Route server does not support route tables associated with virtual private gateways. To propagate routes into a transit gateway route table, use `Transit Gateway Connect <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/tgw-connect.html>`__.

            
            

            - **RouteServerId** *(string) --* 

              The unique identifier of the route server.

              
            

            - **AmazonSideAsn** *(integer) --* 

              The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Autonomous System Number (ASN) for the appliance. Valid values are from 1 to 4294967295. We recommend using a private ASN in the 64512–65534 (16-bit ASN) or 4200000000–4294967294 (32-bit ASN) range.

              
            

            - **State** *(string) --* 

              The current state of the route server.

              
            

            - **Tags** *(list) --* 

              Any tags assigned to the route server.

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                Describes a tag.

                
                

                - **Key** *(string) --* 

                  The key of the tag.

                   

                  Constraints: Tag keys are case-sensitive and accept a maximum of 127 Unicode characters. May not begin with ``aws:``.

                  
                

                - **Value** *(string) --* 

                  The value of the tag.

                   

                  Constraints: Tag values are case-sensitive and accept a maximum of 256 Unicode characters.

                  
            
          
            

            - **PersistRoutesState** *(string) --* 

              The current state of route persistence for the route server.

              
            

            - **PersistRoutesDuration** *(integer) --* 

              The number of minutes a route server will wait after BGP is re-established to unpersist the routes in the FIB and RIB. Value must be in the range of 1-5. The default value is 1. Only valid if ``persistRoutesState`` is 'enabled'.

               

              If you set the duration to 1 minute, then when your network appliance re-establishes BGP with route server, it has 1 minute to relearn it's adjacent network and advertise those routes to route server before route server resumes normal functionality. In most cases, 1 minute is probably sufficient. If, however, you have concerns that your BGP network may not be capable of fully re-establishing and re-learning everything in 1 minute, you can increase the duration up to 5 minutes.

              
            

            - **SnsNotificationsEnabled** *(boolean) --* 

              Indicates whether SNS notifications are enabled for the route server. Enabling SNS notifications persists BGP status changes to an SNS topic provisioned by Amazon Web Services.

              
            

            - **SnsTopicArn** *(string) --* 

              The ARN of the SNS topic where notifications are published.
