.. py:method:: EC2.VpcAddress.associate(**kwargs)

  

  Associates an Elastic IP address, or carrier IP address (for instances that are in subnets in Wavelength Zones) with an instance or a network interface. Before you can use an Elastic IP address, you must allocate it to your account.

   

  If the Elastic IP address is already associated with a different instance, it is disassociated from that instance and associated with the specified instance. If you associate an Elastic IP address with an instance that has an existing Elastic IP address, the existing address is disassociated from the instance, but remains allocated to your account.

   

  [Subnets in Wavelength Zones] You can associate an IP address from the telecommunication carrier to the instance or network interface.

   

  You cannot associate an Elastic IP address with an interface in a different network border group.

   

  .. warning::

     

    This is an idempotent operation. If you perform the operation more than once, Amazon EC2 doesn't return an error, and you may be charged for each time the Elastic IP address is remapped to the same instance. For more information, see the *Elastic IP Addresses* section of `Amazon EC2 Pricing <http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/>`__.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = vpc_address.associate(
        InstanceId='string',
        PublicIp='string',
        DryRun=True|False,
        NetworkInterfaceId='string',
        PrivateIpAddress='string',
        AllowReassociation=True|False
    )
    
  :type InstanceId: string
  :param InstanceId: 

    The ID of the instance. The instance must have exactly one attached network interface. You can specify either the instance ID or the network interface ID, but not both.

    

  
  :type PublicIp: string
  :param PublicIp: 

    Deprecated.

    

  
  :type DryRun: boolean
  :param DryRun: 

    Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is ``DryRunOperation``. Otherwise, it is ``UnauthorizedOperation``.

    

  
  :type NetworkInterfaceId: string
  :param NetworkInterfaceId: 

    The ID of the network interface. If the instance has more than one network interface, you must specify a network interface ID.

     

    You can specify either the instance ID or the network interface ID, but not both.

    

  
  :type PrivateIpAddress: string
  :param PrivateIpAddress: 

    The primary or secondary private IP address to associate with the Elastic IP address. If no private IP address is specified, the Elastic IP address is associated with the primary private IP address.

    

  
  :type AllowReassociation: boolean
  :param AllowReassociation: 

    Reassociation is automatic, but you can specify false to ensure the operation fails if the Elastic IP address is already associated with another resource.

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **AssociationId** *(string) --* 

        The ID that represents the association of the Elastic IP address with an instance.
