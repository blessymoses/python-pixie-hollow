.. py:method:: EC2.ClassicAddress.disassociate(**kwargs)

  

  Disassociates an Elastic IP address from the instance or network interface it's associated with.

   

  This is an idempotent operation. If you perform the operation more than once, Amazon EC2 doesn't return an error.

   

  An address cannot be disassociated if the all of the following conditions are met:

   

  
  * Network interface has a ``publicDualStackDnsName`` publicDnsName
   
  * Public IPv4 address is the primary public IPv4 address
   
  * Network interface only has one remaining public IPv4 address
