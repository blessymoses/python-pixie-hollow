.. py:attribute:: EC2.Instance.maintenance_options

  

  - *(dict) --* 

    Provides information on the recovery and maintenance options of your instance.

    
    

    - **AutoRecovery** *(string) --* 

      Provides information on the current automatic recovery behavior of your instance.

      
    

    - **RebootMigration** *(string) --* 

      Specifies whether to attempt reboot migration during a user-initiated reboot of an instance that has a scheduled ``system-reboot`` event:

       

      
      * ``default`` - Amazon EC2 attempts to migrate the instance to new hardware (reboot migration). If successful, the ``system-reboot`` event is cleared. If unsuccessful, an in-place reboot occurs and the event remains scheduled.
       
      * ``disabled`` - Amazon EC2 keeps the instance on the same hardware (in-place reboot). The ``system-reboot`` event remains scheduled.
      

       

      This setting only applies to supported instances that have a scheduled reboot event. For more information, see `Enable or disable reboot migration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/schedevents_actions_reboot.html#reboot-migration>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.
