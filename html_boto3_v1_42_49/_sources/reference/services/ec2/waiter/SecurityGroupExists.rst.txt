    :type GroupIds: list
    :param GroupIds: 

      The IDs of the security groups. Required for security groups in a nondefault VPC.

       

      Default: Describes all of your security groups.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type GroupNames: list
    :param GroupNames: 

      [Default VPC] The names of the security groups. You can specify either the security group name or the security group ID.

       

      Default: Describes all of your security groups.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type NextToken: string
    :param NextToken: 

      The token returned from a previous paginated request. Pagination continues from the end of the items returned by the previous request.

      

    
    :type MaxResults: integer
    :param MaxResults: 

      The maximum number of items to return for this request. To get the next page of items, make another request with the token returned in the output. This value can be between 5 and 1000. If this parameter is not specified, then all items are returned. For more information, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Query-Requests.html#api-pagination>`__.

      

    
    :type DryRun: boolean
    :param DryRun: 

      Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is ``DryRunOperation``. Otherwise, it is ``UnauthorizedOperation``.

      

    
    :type Filters: list
    :param Filters: 

      The filters. If using multiple filters for rules, the results include security groups for which any combination of rules - not necessarily a single rule - match all filters.

       

      
      * ``description`` - The description of the security group.
       
      * ``egress.ip-permission.cidr`` - An IPv4 CIDR block for an outbound security group rule.
       
      * ``egress.ip-permission.from-port`` - For an outbound rule, the start of port range for the TCP and UDP protocols, or an ICMP type number.
       
      * ``egress.ip-permission.group-id`` - The ID of a security group that has been referenced in an outbound security group rule.
       
      * ``egress.ip-permission.group-name`` - The name of a security group that is referenced in an outbound security group rule.
       
      * ``egress.ip-permission.ipv6-cidr`` - An IPv6 CIDR block for an outbound security group rule.
       
      * ``egress.ip-permission.prefix-list-id`` - The ID of a prefix list to which a security group rule allows outbound access.
       
      * ``egress.ip-permission.protocol`` - The IP protocol for an outbound security group rule ( ``tcp`` | ``udp`` | ``icmp``, a protocol number, or -1 for all protocols).
       
      * ``egress.ip-permission.to-port`` - For an outbound rule, the end of port range for the TCP and UDP protocols, or an ICMP code.
       
      * ``egress.ip-permission.user-id`` - The ID of an Amazon Web Services account that has been referenced in an outbound security group rule.
       
      * ``group-id`` - The ID of the security group.
       
      * ``group-name`` - The name of the security group.
       
      * ``ip-permission.cidr`` - An IPv4 CIDR block for an inbound security group rule.
       
      * ``ip-permission.from-port`` - For an inbound rule, the start of port range for the TCP and UDP protocols, or an ICMP type number.
       
      * ``ip-permission.group-id`` - The ID of a security group that has been referenced in an inbound security group rule.
       
      * ``ip-permission.group-name`` - The name of a security group that is referenced in an inbound security group rule.
       
      * ``ip-permission.ipv6-cidr`` - An IPv6 CIDR block for an inbound security group rule.
       
      * ``ip-permission.prefix-list-id`` - The ID of a prefix list from which a security group rule allows inbound access.
       
      * ``ip-permission.protocol`` - The IP protocol for an inbound security group rule ( ``tcp`` | ``udp`` | ``icmp``, a protocol number, or -1 for all protocols).
       
      * ``ip-permission.to-port`` - For an inbound rule, the end of port range for the TCP and UDP protocols, or an ICMP code.
       
      * ``ip-permission.user-id`` - The ID of an Amazon Web Services account that has been referenced in an inbound security group rule.
       
      * ``owner-id`` - The Amazon Web Services account ID of the owner of the security group.
       
      * ``tag``:<key> - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key ``Owner`` and the value ``TeamA``, specify ``tag:Owner`` for the filter name and ``TeamA`` for the filter value.
       
      * ``tag-key`` - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, regardless of the tag value.
       
      * ``vpc-id`` - The ID of the VPC specified when the security group was created.
      

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more specific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be used to match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as tags, attributes, or IDs.

         

        If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an ``AND``, and the request returns only results that match all of the specified filters.

         

        For more information, see `List and filter using the CLI and API <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Filtering.html#Filtering_Resources_CLI>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

        

      
        - **Name** *(string) --* 

          The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

          

        
        - **Values** *(list) --* 

          The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you specify multiple values for a filter, the values are joined with an ``OR``, and the request returns all results that match any of the specified values.

          

        
          - *(string) --* 

          
      
      
  
    :type WaiterConfig: dict
    :param WaiterConfig: 

      A dictionary that provides parameters to control waiting behavior.

      

    
      - **Delay** *(integer) --* 

        The amount of time in seconds to wait between attempts. Default: 5

        

      
      - **MaxAttempts** *(integer) --* 

        The maximum number of attempts to be made. Default: 6
