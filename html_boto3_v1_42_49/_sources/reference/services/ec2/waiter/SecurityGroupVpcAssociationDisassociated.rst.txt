    :type Filters: list
    :param Filters: 

      Security group VPC association filters.

       

      
      * ``group-id``: The security group ID.
       
      * ``group-owner-id``: The group owner ID.
       
      * ``state``: The state of the association.
       
      * ``vpc-id``: The ID of the associated VPC.
       
      * ``vpc-owner-id``: The account ID of the VPC owner.
      

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more specific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be used to match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as tags, attributes, or IDs.

         

        If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an ``AND``, and the request returns only results that match all of the specified filters.

         

        For more information, see `List and filter using the CLI and API <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Filtering.html#Filtering_Resources_CLI>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

        

      
        - **Name** *(string) --* 

          The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

          

        
        - **Values** *(list) --* 

          The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you specify multiple values for a filter, the values are joined with an ``OR``, and the request returns all results that match any of the specified values.

          

        
          - *(string) --* 

          
      
      
  
    :type NextToken: string
    :param NextToken: 

      The token returned from a previous paginated request. Pagination continues from the end of the items returned by the previous request.

      

    
    :type MaxResults: integer
    :param MaxResults: 

      The maximum number of items to return for this request. To get the next page of items, make another request with the token returned in the output. For more information, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Query-Requests.html#api-pagination>`__.

      

    
    :type DryRun: boolean
    :param DryRun: 

      Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is ``DryRunOperation``. Otherwise, it is ``UnauthorizedOperation``.

      

    
    :type WaiterConfig: dict
    :param WaiterConfig: 

      A dictionary that provides parameters to control waiting behavior.

      

    
      - **Delay** *(integer) --* 

        The amount of time in seconds to wait between attempts. Default: 10

        

      
      - **MaxAttempts** *(integer) --* 

        The maximum number of attempts to be made. Default: 7
