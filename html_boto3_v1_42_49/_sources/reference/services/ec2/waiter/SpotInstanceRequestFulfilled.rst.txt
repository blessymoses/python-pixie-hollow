    :type NextToken: string
    :param NextToken: 

      The token returned from a previous paginated request. Pagination continues from the end of the items returned by the previous request.

      

    
    :type MaxResults: integer
    :param MaxResults: 

      The maximum number of items to return for this request. To get the next page of items, make another request with the token returned in the output.

    :type DryRun: boolean
    :param DryRun:

      - *(dict) --* 

        A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more specific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be used to match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as tags, attributes, or IDs.

         

        If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an ``AND``, and the request returns only results that match all of the specified filters.

         

        For more information, see `List and filter using the CLI and API <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Filtering.html#Filtering_Resources_CLI>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.
