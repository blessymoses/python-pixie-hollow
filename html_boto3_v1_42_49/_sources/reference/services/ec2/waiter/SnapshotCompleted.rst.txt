      )
      
    :type MaxResults: integer
    :param MaxResults: 

      The maximum number of items to return for this request. To get the next page of items, make another request with the token returned in the output. For more information, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Query-Requests.html#api-pagination>`__.

      

    
    :type NextToken: string
    :param NextToken: 

      The token returned from a previous paginated request. Pagination continues from the end of the items returned by the previous request.

      

    
    :type OwnerIds: list
    :param OwnerIds: 

      Scopes the results to snapshots with the specified owners. You can specify a combination of Amazon Web Services account IDs, ``self``, and ``amazon``.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type RestorableByUserIds: list
    :param RestorableByUserIds: 

      The IDs of the Amazon Web Services accounts that can create volumes from the snapshot.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type SnapshotIds: list
    :param SnapshotIds: 

      The snapshot IDs.

       

      Default: Describes the snapshots for which you have create volume permissions.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type DryRun: boolean
    :param DryRun: 

      Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is ``DryRunOperation``. Otherwise, it is ``UnauthorizedOperation``.

      

    
    :type Filters: list
    :param Filters: 

      The filters.

       

      
      * ``description`` - A description of the snapshot.
       
      * ``encrypted`` - Indicates whether the snapshot is encrypted ( ``true`` | ``false``)
       
      * ``owner-alias`` - The owner alias, from an Amazon-maintained list ( ``amazon``). This is not the user-configured Amazon Web Services account alias set using the IAM console. We recommend that you use the related parameter instead of this filter.
       
      * ``owner-id`` - The Amazon Web Services account ID of the owner. We recommend that you use the related parameter instead of this filter.
       
      * ``progress`` - The progress of the snapshot, as a percentage (for example, 80%).
       
      * ``snapshot-id`` - The snapshot ID.
       
      * ``start-time`` - The time stamp when the snapshot was initiated.
       
      * ``status`` - The status of the snapshot ( ``pending`` | ``completed`` | ``error``).
       
      * ``storage-tier`` - The storage tier of the snapshot ( ``archive`` | ``standard``).
       
      * ``transfer-type`` - The type of operation used to create the snapshot ( ``time-based`` | ``standard``).
       
      * ``tag``:<key> - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key ``Owner`` and the value ``TeamA``, specify ``tag:Owner`` for the filter name and ``TeamA`` for the filter value.
       
      * ``tag-key`` - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, regardless of the tag value.
       
      * ``volume-id`` - The ID of the volume the snapshot is for.
       
      * ``volume-size`` - The size of the volume, in GiB.
      

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more specific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be used to match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as tags, attributes, or IDs.

         

        If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an ``AND``, and the request returns only results that match all of the specified filters.

         

        For more information, see `List and filter using the CLI and API <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Filtering.html#Filtering_Resources_CLI>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

        

      
        - **Name** *(string) --* 

          The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

          

        
        - **Values** *(list) --* 

          The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you specify multiple values for a filter, the values are joined with an ``OR``, and the request returns all results that match any of the specified values.

          

        
          - *(string) --* 

          
      
      
  
    :type WaiterConfig: dict
    :param WaiterConfig: 

      A dictionary that provides parameters to control waiting behavior.

      

    
      - **Delay** *(integer) --* 

        The amount of time in seconds to wait between attempts. Default: 15

        

      
      - **MaxAttempts** *(integer) --* 

        The maximum number of attempts to be made. Default: 40

        

      
    
    
    :returns: None
