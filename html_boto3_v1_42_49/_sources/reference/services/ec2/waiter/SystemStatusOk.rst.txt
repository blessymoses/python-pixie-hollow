    :type InstanceIds: list
    :param InstanceIds: 

      The instance IDs.

       

      Default: Describes all your instances.

       

      Constraints: Maximum 100 explicitly specified instance IDs.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type MaxResults: integer
    :param MaxResults: 

      The maximum number of items to return for this request. To get the next page of items, make another request with the token returned in the output. For more information, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Query-Requests.html#api-pagination>`__.

       

      You cannot specify this parameter and the instance IDs parameter in the same request.

      

    
    :type NextToken: string
    :param NextToken: 

      The token returned from a previous paginated request. Pagination continues from the end of the items returned by the previous request.

      

    
    :type DryRun: boolean
    :param DryRun: 

      Checks whether you have the required permissions for the operation, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is ``DryRunOperation``. Otherwise, it is ``UnauthorizedOperation``.

      

    
    :type Filters: list
    :param Filters: 

      The filters.

       

      
      * ``availability-zone`` - The Availability Zone of the instance.
       
      * ``availability-zone-id`` - The ID of the Availability Zone of the instance.
       
      * ``event.code`` - The code for the scheduled event ( ``instance-reboot`` | ``system-reboot`` | ``system-maintenance`` | ``instance-retirement`` | ``instance-stop``).
       
      * ``event.description`` - A description of the event.
       
      * ``event.instance-event-id`` - The ID of the event whose date and time you are modifying.
       
      * ``event.not-after`` - The latest end time for the scheduled event (for example, ``2014-09-15T17:15:20.000Z``).
       
      * ``event.not-before`` - The earliest start time for the scheduled event (for example, ``2014-09-15T17:15:20.000Z``).
       
      * ``event.not-before-deadline`` - The deadline for starting the event (for example, ``2014-09-15T17:15:20.000Z``).
       
      * ``instance-state-code`` - The code for the instance state, as a 16-bit unsigned integer. The high byte is used for internal purposes and should be ignored. The low byte is set based on the state represented. The valid values are 0 (pending), 16 (running), 32 (shutting-down), 48 (terminated), 64 (stopping), and 80 (stopped).
       
      * ``instance-state-name`` - The state of the instance ( ``pending`` | ``running`` | ``shutting-down`` | ``terminated`` | ``stopping`` | ``stopped``).
       
      * ``instance-status.reachability`` - Filters on instance status where the name is ``reachability`` ( ``passed`` | ``failed`` | ``initializing`` | ``insufficient-data``).
       
      * ``instance-status.status`` - The status of the instance ( ``ok`` | ``impaired`` | ``initializing`` | ``insufficient-data`` | ``not-applicable``).
       
      * ``operator.managed`` - A Boolean that indicates whether this is a managed instance.
       
      * ``operator.principal`` - The principal that manages the instance. Only valid for managed instances, where ``managed`` is ``true``.
       
      * ``system-status.reachability`` - Filters on system status where the name is ``reachability`` ( ``passed`` | ``failed`` | ``initializing`` | ``insufficient-data``).
       
      * ``system-status.status`` - The system status of the instance ( ``ok`` | ``impaired`` | ``initializing`` | ``insufficient-data`` | ``not-applicable``).
       
      * ``attached-ebs-status.status`` - The status of the attached EBS volume for the instance ( ``ok`` | ``impaired`` | ``initializing`` | ``insufficient-data`` | ``not-applicable``).
      

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more specific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be used to match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as tags, attributes, or IDs.

         

        If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an ``AND``, and the request returns only results that match all of the specified filters.

         

        For more information, see `List and filter using the CLI and API <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Filtering.html#Filtering_Resources_CLI>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

        

      
        - **Name** *(string) --* 

          The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

          

        
        - **Values** *(list) --* 

          The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you specify multiple values for a filter, the values are joined with an ``OR``, and the request returns all results that match any of the specified values.

          

        
          - *(string) --* 

          
      
      
  
    :type IncludeAllInstances: boolean
    :param IncludeAllInstances: 

      When ``true``, includes the health status for all instances. When ``false``, includes the health status for running instances only.

       

      Default: ``false``

      

    
    :type WaiterConfig: dict
    :param WaiterConfig: 

      A dictionary that provides parameters to control waiting behavior.

      

    
      - **Delay** *(integer) --* 

        The amount of time in seconds to wait between attempts. Default: 15

        

      
      - **MaxAttempts** *(integer) --* 

        The maximum number of attempts to be made. Default: 40
