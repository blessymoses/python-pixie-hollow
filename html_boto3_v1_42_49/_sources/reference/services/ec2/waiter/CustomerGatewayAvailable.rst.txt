    :type CustomerGatewayIds: list
    :param CustomerGatewayIds: 

      One or more customer gateway IDs.

       

      Default: Describes all your customer gateways.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type Filters: list
    :param Filters: 

      One or more filters.

       

      
      * ``bgp-asn`` - The customer gateway's Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Autonomous System Number (ASN).
       
      * ``customer-gateway-id`` - The ID of the customer gateway.
       
      * ``ip-address`` - The IP address of the customer gateway device's external interface.
       
      * ``state`` - The state of the customer gateway ( ``pending`` | ``available`` | ``deleting`` | ``deleted``).
       
      * ``type`` - The type of customer gateway. Currently, the only supported type is ``ipsec.1``.
       
      * ``tag``:<key> - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key ``Owner`` and the value ``TeamA``, specify ``tag:Owner`` for the filter name and ``TeamA`` for the filter value.
       
      * ``tag-key`` - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, regardless of the tag value.
      

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more specific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be used to match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as tags, attributes, or IDs.

         

        If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an ``AND``, and the request returns only results that match all of the specified filters.

         

        For more information, see `List and filter using the CLI and API <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Filtering.html#Filtering_Resources_CLI>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

        

      
        - **Name** *(string) --* 

          The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

          

        
        - **Values** *(list) --* 

          The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you specify multiple values for a filter, the values are joined with an ``OR``, and the request returns all results that match any of the specified values.

          

        
          - *(string) --* 

          
      
      
  
    :type DryRun: boolean
    :param DryRun: 

      Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is ``DryRunOperation``. Otherwise, it is ``UnauthorizedOperation``.

      

    
    :type WaiterConfig: dict
    :param WaiterConfig: 

      A dictionary that provides parameters to control waiting behavior.

      

    
      - **Delay** *(integer) --* 

        The amount of time in seconds to wait between attempts. Default: 15

        

      
      - **MaxAttempts** *(integer) --* 

        The maximum number of attempts to be made. Default: 40

        

      
    
    
    :returns: None
