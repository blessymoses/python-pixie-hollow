  .. py:method:: create_tags(**kwargs)

    

    Adds or overwrites only the specified tags for the specified Amazon EC2 resource or resources. When you specify an existing tag key, the value is overwritten with the new value. Each resource can have a maximum of 50 tags. Each tag consists of a key and optional value. Tag keys must be unique per resource.

     

    For more information about tags, see `Tag your Amazon EC2 resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html>`__ in the *Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide*. For more information about creating IAM policies that control users' access to resources based on tags, see `Supported resource-level permissions for Amazon EC2 API actions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-supported-iam-actions-resources.html>`__ in the *Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide*.

  .. py:method:: start(**kwargs)

    

    Starts an Amazon EBS-backed instance that you've previously stopped.

     

    Instances that use Amazon EBS volumes as their root devices can be quickly stopped and started. When an instance is stopped, the compute resources are released and you are not billed for instance usage. However, your root partition Amazon EBS volume remains and continues to persist your data, and you are charged for Amazon EBS volume usage. You can restart your instance at any time. Every time you start your instance, Amazon EC2 charges a one-minute minimum for instance usage, and thereafter charges per second for instance usage.

     

    Before stopping an instance, make sure it is in a state from which it can be restarted. Stopping an instance does not preserve data stored in RAM.

     

    Performing this operation on an instance that uses an instance store as its root device returns an error.

     

    If you attempt to start a T3 instance with ``host`` tenancy and the ``unlimited`` CPU credit option, the request fails. The ``unlimited`` CPU credit option is not supported on Dedicated Hosts. Before you start the instance, either change its CPU credit option to ``standard``, or change its tenancy to ``default`` or ``dedicated``.

                The high byte is all of the bits between 2^8 and (2^16)-1, which equals decimal values between 256 and 65,535. These numerical values are used for internal purposes and should be ignored.

                 

                The low byte is all of the bits between 2^0 and (2^8)-1, which equals decimal values between 0 and 255.

                 

                The valid values for instance-state-code will all be in the range of the low byte and they are:

  .. py:method:: stop(**kwargs)

    

    Stops an Amazon EBS-backed instance. You can restart your instance at any time using the `StartInstances <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_StartInstances.html>`__ API. For more information, see `Stop and start Amazon EC2 instances <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Stop_Start.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

     

    When you stop or hibernate an instance, we shut it down. By default, this includes a graceful operating system (OS) shutdown. To bypass the graceful shutdown, use the ``skipOsShutdown`` parameter; however, this might risk data integrity.

     

    You can use the StopInstances operation together with the ``Hibernate`` parameter to hibernate an instance if the instance is `enabled for hibernation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/enabling-hibernation.html>`__ and meets the `hibernation prerequisites <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/hibernating-prerequisites.html>`__. Stopping an instance doesn't preserve data stored in RAM, while hibernation does. If hibernation fails, a normal shutdown occurs. For more information, see `Hibernate your Amazon EC2 instance <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Hibernate.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

     

    If your instance appears stuck in the ``stopping`` state, there might be an issue with the underlying host computer. You can use the StopInstances operation together with the Force parameter to force stop your instance. For more information, see `Troubleshoot Amazon EC2 instance stop issues <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/TroubleshootingInstancesStopping.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

     

    Stopping and hibernating an instance differs from rebooting or terminating it. For example, a stopped or hibernated instance retains its root volume and any data volumes, unlike terminated instances where these volumes are automatically deleted. For more information about the differences between stopping, hibernating, rebooting, and terminating instances, see `Amazon EC2 instance state changes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-lifecycle.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

     

    We don't charge for instance usage or data transfer fees when an instance is stopped. However, the root volume and any data volumes remain and continue to persist your data, and you're charged for volume usage. Every time you start your instance, Amazon EC2 charges a one-minute minimum for instance usage, followed by per-second billing.

     

    You can't stop or hibernate instance store-backed instances.

  .. py:method:: terminate(**kwargs)

    

    Terminates (deletes) the specified instances. This operation is `idempotent <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/devguide/ec2-api-idempotency.html>`__; if you terminate an instance more than once, each call succeeds.

     

    .. warning::

       

      **Terminating an instance is permanent and irreversible.**

       

      After you terminate an instance, you can no longer connect to it, and it can't be recovered. All attached Amazon EBS volumes that are configured to be deleted on termination are also permanently deleted and can't be recovered. All data stored on instance store volumes is permanently lost. For more information, see `How instance termination works <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/how-ec2-instance-termination-works.html>`__.

       

      Before you terminate an instance, ensure that you have backed up all data that you need to retain after the termination to persistent storage.

       

     

    If you specify multiple instances and the request fails (for example, because of a single incorrect instance ID), none of the instances are terminated.

     

    If you terminate multiple instances across multiple Availability Zones, and one or more of the specified instances are enabled for termination protection, the request fails with the following results:

     

    
    * The specified instances that are in the same Availability Zone as the protected instance are not terminated.
     
    * The specified instances that are in different Availability Zones, where no other specified instances are protected, are successfully terminated.
    

     

    For example, say you have the following instances:

     

    
    * Instance A: ``us-east-1a``; Not protected
     
    * Instance B: ``us-east-1a``; Not protected
     
    * Instance C: ``us-east-1b``; Protected
     
    * Instance D: ``us-east-1b``; not protected
    

     

    If you attempt to terminate all of these instances in the same request, the request reports failure with the following results:

     

    
    * Instance A and Instance B are successfully terminated because none of the specified instances in ``us-east-1a`` are enabled for termination protection.
     
    * Instance C and Instance D fail to terminate because at least one of the specified instances in ``us-east-1b`` (Instance C) is enabled for termination protection.
    

     

    Terminated instances remain visible after termination (for approximately one hour).

     

    By default, Amazon EC2 deletes all EBS volumes that were attached when the instance launched. Volumes attached after instance launch continue running.

     

    By default, the TerminateInstances operation includes a graceful operating system (OS) shutdown. To bypass the graceful shutdown, use the ``skipOsShutdown`` parameter; however, this might risk data integrity.

     

    You can stop, start, and terminate EBS-backed instances. You can only terminate instance store-backed instances. What happens to an instance differs if you stop or terminate it. For example, when you stop an instance, the root device and any other devices attached to the instance persist. When you terminate an instance, any attached EBS volumes with the ``DeleteOnTermination`` block device mapping parameter set to ``true`` are automatically deleted. For more information about the differences between stopping and terminating instances, see `Amazon EC2 instance state changes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-lifecycle.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

     

    When you terminate an instance, we attempt to terminate it forcibly after a short while. If your instance appears stuck in the shutting-down state after a period of time, there might be an issue with the underlying host computer. For more information about terminating and troubleshooting terminating your instances, see `Terminate Amazon EC2 instances <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/>`__ and `Troubleshooting terminating your instance <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/TroubleshootingInstancesShuttingDown.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

      Forces the instances to terminate. The instance will first attempt a graceful shutdown, which includes flushing file system caches and metadata. If the graceful shutdown fails to complete within the timeout period, the instance shuts down forcibly without flushing the file system caches and metadata.

      

    
    :type SkipOsShutdown: boolean
