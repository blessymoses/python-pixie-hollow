.. py:attribute:: EC2.ServiceResource.network_interfaces

  A collection of NetworkInterface resources.A NetworkInterface Collection will include all resources by default, and extreme caution should be taken when performing actions on all resources.

  .. py:method:: all()

    Creates an iterable of all NetworkInterface resources in the collection.

      * ``tag-key`` - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, regardless of the tag value.

      - *(dict) --* 

        A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more specific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be used to match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as tags, attributes, or IDs.

         

        If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an ``AND``, and the request returns only results that match all of the specified filters.

         

        For more information, see `List and filter using the CLI and API <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Filtering.html#Filtering_Resources_CLI>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

        

      
        - **Name** *(string) --*

        - **Values** *(list) --* 

          The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you specify multiple values for a filter, the values are joined with an ``OR``, and the request returns all results that match any of the specified values.
