.. py:attribute:: EC2.ServiceResource.volumes

  A collection of Volume resources.A Volume Collection will include all resources by default, and extreme caution should be taken when performing actions on all resources.

  .. py:method:: all()

    Creates an iterable of all Volume resources in the collection.

  .. py:method:: filter(**kwargs)

    Creates an iterable of all Volume resources in the collection filtered by kwargs passed to method. A Volume collection will include all resources by default if no filters are provided, and extreme caution should be taken when performing actions on all resources.

    :type DryRun: boolean
    :param DryRun: 

      Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is ``DryRunOperation``. Otherwise, it is ``UnauthorizedOperation``.

      

    
    :type Filters: list
    :param Filters: 

      The filters.

       

      
      * ``attachment.attach-time`` - The time stamp when the attachment initiated.
       
      * ``attachment.delete-on-termination`` - Whether the volume is deleted on instance termination.
       
      * ``attachment.device`` - The device name specified in the block device mapping (for example, ``/dev/sda1``).
       
      * ``attachment.instance-id`` - The ID of the instance the volume is attached to.
       
      * ``attachment.status`` - The attachment state ( ``attaching`` | ``attached`` | ``detaching``).
       
      * ``availability-zone`` - The Availability Zone in which the volume was created.
       
      * ``availability-zone-id`` - The ID of the Availability Zone in which the volume was created.
       
      * ``create-time`` - The time stamp when the volume was created.
       
      * ``encrypted`` - Indicates whether the volume is encrypted ( ``true`` | ``false``)
       
      * ``fast-restored`` - Indicates whether the volume was created from a snapshot that is enabled for fast snapshot restore ( ``true`` | ``false``).
       
      * ``multi-attach-enabled`` - Indicates whether the volume is enabled for Multi-Attach ( ``true`` | ``false``)
       
      * ``operator.managed`` - A Boolean that indicates whether this is a managed volume.
       
      * ``operator.principal`` - The principal that manages the volume. Only valid for managed volumes, where ``managed`` is ``true``.
       
      * ``size`` - The size of the volume, in GiB.
       
      * ``snapshot-id`` - The snapshot from which the volume was created.
       
      * ``status`` - The state of the volume ( ``creating`` | ``available`` | ``in-use`` | ``deleting`` | ``deleted`` | ``error``).
       
      * ``tag``:<key> - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key ``Owner`` and the value ``TeamA``, specify ``tag:Owner`` for the filter name and ``TeamA`` for the filter value.
       
      * ``tag-key`` - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, regardless of the tag value.
       
      * ``volume-id`` - The volume ID.
       
      * ``volume-type`` - The Amazon EBS volume type ( ``gp2`` | ``gp3`` | ``io1`` | ``io2`` | ``st1`` | ``sc1``| ``standard``)
      

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more specific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be used to match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as tags, attributes, or IDs.

         

        If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an ``AND``, and the request returns only results that match all of the specified filters.

         

        For more information, see `List and filter using the CLI and API <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Filtering.html#Filtering_Resources_CLI>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

        

      
        - **Name** *(string) --* 

          The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

          

        
        - **Values** *(list) --* 

          The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you specify multiple values for a filter, the values are joined with an ``OR``, and the request returns all results that match any of the specified values.

          

        
          - *(string) --* 

          
      
      
  
    :type NextToken: string
    :param NextToken: 

      The token returned from a previous paginated request. Pagination continues from the end of the items returned by the previous request.

      

    
    :type MaxResults: integer
    :param MaxResults: 

      The maximum number of items to return for this request. To get the next page of items, make another request with the token returned in the output.
