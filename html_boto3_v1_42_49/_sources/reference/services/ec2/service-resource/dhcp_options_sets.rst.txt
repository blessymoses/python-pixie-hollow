.. py:attribute:: EC2.ServiceResource.dhcp_options_sets

  A collection of DhcpOptions resources.A DhcpOptions Collection will include all resources by default, and extreme caution should be taken when performing actions on all resources.

  .. py:method:: all()

    Creates an iterable of all DhcpOptions resources in the collection.

    :returns: A list of DhcpOptions resources
    

  .. py:method:: filter(**kwargs)

    Creates an iterable of all DhcpOptions resources in the collection filtered by kwargs passed to method. A DhcpOptions collection will include all resources by default if no filters are provided, and extreme caution should be taken when performing actions on all resources.

    :type DhcpOptionsIds: list
    :param DhcpOptionsIds: 

      The IDs of DHCP option sets.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type NextToken: string
    :param NextToken: 

      The token returned from a previous paginated request. Pagination continues from the end of the items returned by the previous request.

      

    
    :type MaxResults: integer
    :param MaxResults: 

      The maximum number of items to return for this request. To get the next page of items, make another request with the token returned in the output. For more information, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Query-Requests.html#api-pagination>`__.

      

    
    :type DryRun: boolean
    :param DryRun: 

      Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is ``DryRunOperation``. Otherwise, it is ``UnauthorizedOperation``.

      

    
    :type Filters: list
    :param Filters: 

      The filters.

       

      
      * ``dhcp-options-id`` - The ID of a DHCP options set.
       
      * ``key`` - The key for one of the options (for example, ``domain-name``).
       
      * ``value`` - The value for one of the options.
       
      * ``owner-id`` - The ID of the Amazon Web Services account that owns the DHCP options set.
       
      * ``tag`` - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key ``Owner`` and the value ``TeamA``, specify ``tag:Owner`` for the filter name and ``TeamA`` for the filter value.
       
      * ``tag-key`` - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, regardless of the tag value.
      

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more specific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be used to match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as tags, attributes, or IDs.

         

        If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an ``AND``, and the request returns only results that match all of the specified filters.

         

        For more information, see `List and filter using the CLI and API <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Filtering.html#Filtering_Resources_CLI>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

        

      
        - **Name** *(string) --* 

          The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

          

        
        - **Values** *(list) --* 

          The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you specify multiple values for a filter, the values are joined with an ``OR``, and the request returns all results that match any of the specified values.

          

        
          - *(string) --* 

          
      
      
  
    
    :rtype: list(:py:class:`ec2.DhcpOptions`)
    :returns: A list of DhcpOptions resources
    

  .. py:method:: limit(**kwargs)

    Creates an iterable up to a specified amount of DhcpOptions resources in the collection.
