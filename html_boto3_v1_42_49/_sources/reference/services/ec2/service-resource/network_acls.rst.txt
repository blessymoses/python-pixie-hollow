.. py:attribute:: EC2.ServiceResource.network_acls

  A collection of NetworkAcl resources.A NetworkAcl Collection will include all resources by default, and extreme caution should be taken when performing actions on all resources.

  .. py:method:: all()

    Creates an iterable of all NetworkAcl resources in the collection.

  .. py:method:: filter(**kwargs)

    Creates an iterable of all NetworkAcl resources in the collection filtered by kwargs passed to method. A NetworkAcl collection will include all resources by default if no filters are provided, and extreme caution should be taken when performing actions on all resources.

    :type NextToken: string
    :param NextToken: 

      The token returned from a previous paginated request. Pagination continues from the end of the items returned by the previous request.

      

    
    :type MaxResults: integer
    :param MaxResults: 

      The maximum number of items to return for this request. To get the next page of items, make another request with the token returned in the output. For more information, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Query-Requests.html#api-pagination>`__.

      

    
    :type DryRun: boolean
    :param DryRun: 

      Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is ``DryRunOperation``. Otherwise, it is ``UnauthorizedOperation``.

      

    
    :type NetworkAclIds: list
    :param NetworkAclIds: 

      The IDs of the network ACLs.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type Filters: list
    :param Filters: 

      The filters.

       

      
      * ``association.association-id`` - The ID of an association ID for the ACL.
       
      * ``association.network-acl-id`` - The ID of the network ACL involved in the association.
       
      * ``association.subnet-id`` - The ID of the subnet involved in the association.
       
      * ``default`` - Indicates whether the ACL is the default network ACL for the VPC.
       
      * ``entry.cidr`` - The IPv4 CIDR range specified in the entry.
       
      * ``entry.icmp.code`` - The ICMP code specified in the entry, if any.
       
      * ``entry.icmp.type`` - The ICMP type specified in the entry, if any.
       
      * ``entry.ipv6-cidr`` - The IPv6 CIDR range specified in the entry.
       
      * ``entry.port-range.from`` - The start of the port range specified in the entry.
       
      * ``entry.port-range.to`` - The end of the port range specified in the entry.
       
      * ``entry.protocol`` - The protocol specified in the entry ( ``tcp`` | ``udp`` | ``icmp`` or a protocol number).
       
      * ``entry.rule-action`` - Allows or denies the matching traffic ( ``allow`` | ``deny``).
       
      * ``entry.egress`` - A Boolean that indicates the type of rule. Specify ``true`` for egress rules, or ``false`` for ingress rules.
       
      * ``entry.rule-number`` - The number of an entry (in other words, rule) in the set of ACL entries.
       
      * ``network-acl-id`` - The ID of the network ACL.
       
      * ``owner-id`` - The ID of the Amazon Web Services account that owns the network ACL.
       
      * ``tag`` - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key ``Owner`` and the value ``TeamA``, specify ``tag:Owner`` for the filter name and ``TeamA`` for the filter value.
       
      * ``tag-key`` - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, regardless of the tag value.
       
      * ``vpc-id`` - The ID of the VPC for the network ACL.
      

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more specific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be used to match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as tags, attributes, or IDs.

         

        If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an ``AND``, and the request returns only results that match all of the specified filters.

         

        For more information, see `List and filter using the CLI and API <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Filtering.html#Filtering_Resources_CLI>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

        

      
        - **Name** *(string) --* 

          The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

          

        
        - **Values** *(list) --* 

          The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you specify multiple values for a filter, the values are joined with an ``OR``, and the request returns all results that match any of the specified values.
