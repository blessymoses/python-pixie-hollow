.. py:attribute:: EC2.ServiceResource.route_tables

  A collection of RouteTable resources.A RouteTable Collection will include all resources by default, and extreme caution should be taken when performing actions on all resources.

  .. py:method:: all()

    Creates an iterable of all RouteTable resources in the collection.

  .. py:method:: filter(**kwargs)

    Creates an iterable of all RouteTable resources in the collection filtered by kwargs passed to method. A RouteTable collection will include all resources by default if no filters are provided, and extreme caution should be taken when performing actions on all resources.

    :type NextToken: string
    :param NextToken: 

      The token returned from a previous paginated request. Pagination continues from the end of the items returned by the previous request.

      

    
    :type MaxResults: integer
    :param MaxResults: 

      The maximum number of items to return for this request. To get the next page of items, make another request with the token returned in the output. For more information, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Query-Requests.html#api-pagination>`__.

      

    
    :type DryRun: boolean
    :param DryRun: 

      Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is ``DryRunOperation``. Otherwise, it is ``UnauthorizedOperation``.

      

    
    :type RouteTableIds: list
    :param RouteTableIds: 

      The IDs of the route tables.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    :type Filters: list
    :param Filters: 

      The filters.

       

      
      * ``association.gateway-id`` - The ID of the gateway involved in the association.
       
      * ``association.route-table-association-id`` - The ID of an association ID for the route table.
       
      * ``association.route-table-id`` - The ID of the route table involved in the association.
       
      * ``association.subnet-id`` - The ID of the subnet involved in the association.
       
      * ``association.main`` - Indicates whether the route table is the main route table for the VPC ( ``true`` | ``false``). Route tables that do not have an association ID are not returned in the response.
       
      * ``owner-id`` - The ID of the Amazon Web Services account that owns the route table.
       
      * ``route-table-id`` - The ID of the route table.
       
      * ``route.destination-cidr-block`` - The IPv4 CIDR range specified in a route in the table.
       
      * ``route.destination-ipv6-cidr-block`` - The IPv6 CIDR range specified in a route in the route table.
       
      * ``route.destination-prefix-list-id`` - The ID (prefix) of the Amazon Web Services service specified in a route in the table.
       
      * ``route.egress-only-internet-gateway-id`` - The ID of an egress-only Internet gateway specified in a route in the route table.
       
      * ``route.gateway-id`` - The ID of a gateway specified in a route in the table.
       
      * ``route.instance-id`` - The ID of an instance specified in a route in the table.
       
      * ``route.nat-gateway-id`` - The ID of a NAT gateway.
       
      * ``route.transit-gateway-id`` - The ID of a transit gateway.
       
      * ``route.origin`` - Describes how the route was created. ``CreateRouteTable`` indicates that the route was automatically created when the route table was created; ``CreateRoute`` indicates that the route was manually added to the route table; ``EnableVgwRoutePropagation`` indicates that the route was propagated by route propagation.
       
      * ``route.state`` - The state of a route in the route table ( ``active`` | ``blackhole``). The blackhole state indicates that the route's target isn't available (for example, the specified gateway isn't attached to the VPC, the specified NAT instance has been terminated, and so on).
       
      * ``route.vpc-peering-connection-id`` - The ID of a VPC peering connection specified in a route in the table.
       
      * ``tag`` - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key ``Owner`` and the value ``TeamA``, specify ``tag:Owner`` for the filter name and ``TeamA`` for the filter value.
       
      * ``tag-key`` - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, regardless of the tag value.
       
      * ``vpc-id`` - The ID of the VPC for the route table.
      

      

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more specific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be used to match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as tags, attributes, or IDs.

         

        If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an ``AND``, and the request returns only results that match all of the specified filters.

         

        For more information, see `List and filter using the CLI and API <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Filtering.html#Filtering_Resources_CLI>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

        

      
        - **Name** *(string) --* 

          The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

          

        
        - **Values** *(list) --* 

          The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you specify multiple values for a filter, the values are joined with an ``OR``, and the request returns all results that match any of the specified values.
