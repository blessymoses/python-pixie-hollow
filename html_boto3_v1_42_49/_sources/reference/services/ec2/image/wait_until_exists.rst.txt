.. py:method:: EC2.Image.wait_until_exists(**kwargs)

  Waits until this Image is exists. This method calls :py:meth:`EC2.Waiter.image_exists.wait` which polls :py:meth:`EC2.Client.describe_images` every 15 seconds until a successful state is reached. An error is raised after 40 failed checks.

  :type ExecutableUsers: list
  :param ExecutableUsers: 

    Scopes the images by users with explicit launch permissions. Specify an Amazon Web Services account ID, ``self`` (the sender of the request), or ``all`` (public AMIs).

     

    
    * If you specify an Amazon Web Services account ID that is not your own, only AMIs shared with that specific Amazon Web Services account ID are returned. However, AMIs that are shared with the account’s organization or organizational unit (OU) are not returned.
     
    * If you specify ``self`` or your own Amazon Web Services account ID, AMIs shared with your account are returned. In addition, AMIs that are shared with the organization or OU of which you are member are also returned.
     
    * If you specify ``all``, all public AMIs are returned.
    

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type Owners: list
  :param Owners: 

    Scopes the results to images with the specified owners. You can specify a combination of Amazon Web Services account IDs, ``self``, ``amazon``, ``aws-backup-vault``, and ``aws-marketplace``. If you omit this parameter, the results include all images for which you have launch permissions, regardless of ownership.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type IncludeDeprecated: boolean
  :param IncludeDeprecated: 

    Specifies whether to include deprecated AMIs.

     

    Default: No deprecated AMIs are included in the response.

     

    .. note::

      

      If you are the AMI owner, all deprecated AMIs appear in the response regardless of what you specify for this parameter.

      

    

  
  :type IncludeDisabled: boolean
  :param IncludeDisabled: 

    Specifies whether to include disabled AMIs.

     

    Default: No disabled AMIs are included in the response.

    

  
  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    The maximum number of items to return for this request. To get the next page of items, make another request with the token returned in the output. For more information, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Query-Requests.html#api-pagination>`__.

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    The token returned from a previous paginated request. Pagination continues from the end of the items returned by the previous request.

    

  
  :type DryRun: boolean
  :param DryRun: 

    Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is ``DryRunOperation``. Otherwise, it is ``UnauthorizedOperation``.

    

  
  :type Filters: list
  :param Filters: 

    The filters.

     

    
    * ``architecture`` - The image architecture ( ``i386`` | ``x86_64`` | ``arm64`` | ``x86_64_mac`` | ``arm64_mac``).
     
    * ``block-device-mapping.delete-on-termination`` - A Boolean value that indicates whether the Amazon EBS volume is deleted on instance termination.
     
    * ``block-device-mapping.device-name`` - The device name specified in the block device mapping (for example, ``/dev/sdh`` or ``xvdh``).
     
    * ``block-device-mapping.snapshot-id`` - The ID of the snapshot used for the Amazon EBS volume.
     
    * ``block-device-mapping.volume-size`` - The volume size of the Amazon EBS volume, in GiB.

    * ``description`` - The description of the image (provided during image creation).
     
    * ``ena-support`` - A Boolean that indicates whether enhanced networking with ENA is enabled.

    * ``hypervisor`` - The hypervisor type ( ``ovm`` | ``xen``).
     
    * ``image-allowed`` - A Boolean that indicates whether the image meets the criteria specified for Allowed AMIs.
     
    * ``image-id`` - The ID of the image.

    * ``owner-alias`` - The owner alias ( ``amazon`` | ``aws-backup-vault`` | ``aws-marketplace``). The valid aliases are defined in an Amazon-maintained list. This is not the Amazon Web Services account alias that can be set using the IAM console. We recommend that you use the **Owner** request parameter instead of this filter.

    * ``platform`` - The platform. The only supported value is ``windows``.

    * ``state-reason-message`` - The message for the state change.
     
    * ``sriov-net-support`` - A value of ``simple`` indicates that enhanced networking with the Intel 82599 VF interface is enabled.
     
    * ``tag:<key>`` - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key ``Owner`` and the value ``TeamA``, specify ``tag:Owner`` for the filter name and ``TeamA`` for the filter value.
     
    * ``tag-key`` - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, regardless of the tag value.

    - *(dict) --* 

      A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more specific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be used to match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as tags, attributes, or IDs.

       

      If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an ``AND``, and the request returns only results that match all of the specified filters.

       

      For more information, see `List and filter using the CLI and API <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Filtering.html#Filtering_Resources_CLI>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

      

    
      - **Name** *(string) --*

      - **Values** *(list) --* 

        The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you specify multiple values for a filter, the values are joined with an ``OR``, and the request returns all results that match any of the specified values.

        

      
        - *(string) --*
