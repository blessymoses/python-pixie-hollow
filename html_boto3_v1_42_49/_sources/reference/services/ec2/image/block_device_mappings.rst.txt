.. py:attribute:: EC2.Image.block_device_mappings

  

  - *(list) --* 

    Any block device mapping entries.

    
    

    - *(dict) --* 

      Describes a block device mapping, which defines the EBS volumes and instance store volumes to attach to an instance at launch.

      
      

      - **Ebs** *(dict) --* 

        Parameters used to automatically set up EBS volumes when the instance is launched.

        
        

        - **DeleteOnTermination** *(boolean) --* 

          Indicates whether the EBS volume is deleted on instance termination. For more information, see `Preserving Amazon EBS volumes on instance termination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/terminating-instances.html#preserving-volumes-on-termination>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

          
        

        - **Iops** *(integer) --* 

          The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS). For ``gp3``, ``io1``, and ``io2`` volumes, this represents the number of IOPS that are provisioned for the volume. For ``gp2`` volumes, this represents the baseline performance of the volume and the rate at which the volume accumulates I/O credits for bursting.

           

          The following are the supported values for each volume type:

           

          
          * ``gp3``: 3,000 - 80,000 IOPS
           
          * ``io1``: 100 - 64,000 IOPS
           
          * ``io2``: 100 - 256,000 IOPS
          

           

          For ``io2`` volumes, you can achieve up to 256,000 IOPS on `instances built on the Nitro System <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html#ec2-nitro-instances>`__. On other instances, you can achieve performance up to 32,000 IOPS.

           

          This parameter is required for ``io1`` and ``io2`` volumes. The default for ``gp3`` volumes is 3,000 IOPS.

          
        

        - **SnapshotId** *(string) --* 

          The ID of the snapshot.

          
        

        - **VolumeSize** *(integer) --* 

          The size of the volume, in GiBs. You must specify either a snapshot ID or a volume size. If you specify a snapshot, the default is the snapshot size. You can specify a volume size that is equal to or larger than the snapshot size.

           

          The following are the supported sizes for each volume type:

           

          
          * ``gp2``: 1 - 16,384 GiB
           
          * ``gp3``: 1 - 65,536 GiB
           
          * ``io1``: 4 - 16,384 GiB
           
          * ``io2``: 4 - 65,536 GiB
           
          * ``st1`` and ``sc1``: 125 - 16,384 GiB
           
          * ``standard``: 1 - 1024 GiB
          

          
        

        - **VolumeType** *(string) --* 

          The volume type. For more information, see `Amazon EBS volume types <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-volume-types.html>`__ in the *Amazon EBS User Guide*.

          
        

        - **KmsKeyId** *(string) --* 

          Identifier (key ID, key alias, key ARN, or alias ARN) of the customer managed KMS key to use for EBS encryption.

           

          This parameter is only supported on ``BlockDeviceMapping`` objects called by `RunInstances <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_RunInstances.html>`__, `RequestSpotFleet <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_RequestSpotFleet.html>`__, and `RequestSpotInstances <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_RequestSpotInstances.html>`__.

          
        

        - **Throughput** *(integer) --* 

          The throughput that the volume supports, in MiB/s.

           

          This parameter is valid only for ``gp3`` volumes.

           

          Valid Range: Minimum value of 125. Maximum value of 2,000.

          
        

        - **OutpostArn** *(string) --* 

          The ARN of the Outpost on which the snapshot is stored.

           

          This parameter is not supported when using `CreateImage <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_CreateImage.html>`__.

          
        

        - **AvailabilityZone** *(string) --* 

          The Availability Zone where the EBS volume will be created (for example, ``us-east-1a``).

           

          Either ``AvailabilityZone`` or ``AvailabilityZoneId`` can be specified, but not both. If neither is specified, Amazon EC2 automatically selects an Availability Zone within the Region.

           

          This parameter is not supported when using `CreateFleet <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_CreateFleet.html>`__, `CreateImage <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_CreateImage.html>`__, `DescribeImages <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeImages.html>`__, `RequestSpotFleet <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_RequestSpotFleet.html>`__, `RequestSpotInstances <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_RequestSpotInstances.html>`__, and `RunInstances <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_RunInstances.html>`__.

          
        

        - **Encrypted** *(boolean) --* 

          Indicates whether the encryption state of an EBS volume is changed while being restored from a backing snapshot. The effect of setting the encryption state to ``true`` depends on the volume origin (new or from a snapshot), starting encryption state, ownership, and whether encryption by default is enabled. For more information, see `Amazon EBS encryption <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-encryption.html#encryption-parameters>`__ in the *Amazon EBS User Guide*.

           

          In no case can you remove encryption from an encrypted volume.

           

          Encrypted volumes can only be attached to instances that support Amazon EBS encryption. For more information, see `Supported instance types <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-encryption-requirements.html#ebs-encryption_supported_instances>`__.

           

          This parameter is not returned by  DescribeImageAttribute.

           

          For  CreateImage and  RegisterImage, whether you can include this parameter, and the allowed values differ depending on the type of block device mapping you are creating.

           

          
          * If you are creating a block device mapping for a **new (empty) volume**, you can include this parameter, and specify either ``true`` for an encrypted volume, or ``false`` for an unencrypted volume. If you omit this parameter, it defaults to ``false`` (unencrypted).
           
          * If you are creating a block device mapping from an **existing encrypted or unencrypted snapshot**, you must omit this parameter. If you include this parameter, the request will fail, regardless of the value that you specify.
           
          * If you are creating a block device mapping from an **existing unencrypted volume**, you can include this parameter, but you must specify ``false``. If you specify ``true``, the request will fail. In this case, we recommend that you omit the parameter.
           
          * If you are creating a block device mapping from an **existing encrypted volume**, you can include this parameter, and specify either ``true`` or ``false``. However, if you specify ``false``, the parameter is ignored and the block device mapping is always encrypted. In this case, we recommend that you omit the parameter.
          

          
        

        - **VolumeInitializationRate** *(integer) --* 

          Specifies the Amazon EBS Provisioned Rate for Volume Initialization (volume initialization rate), in MiB/s, at which to download the snapshot blocks from Amazon S3 to the volume. This is also known as *volume initialization*. Specifying a volume initialization rate ensures that the volume is initialized at a predictable and consistent rate after creation. For more information, see `Initialize Amazon EBS volumes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/initalize-volume.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

           

          This parameter is supported only for volumes created from snapshots. Omit this parameter if:

           

          
          * You want to create the volume using fast snapshot restore. You must specify a snapshot that is enabled for fast snapshot restore. In this case, the volume is fully initialized at creation. 

          .. note::

            If you specify a snapshot that is enabled for fast snapshot restore and a volume initialization rate, the volume will be initialized at the specified rate instead of fast snapshot restore.

          
           
          * You want to create a volume that is initialized at the default rate.
          

           

          This parameter is not supported when using `CreateImage <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_CreateImage.html>`__ and `DescribeImages <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeImages.html>`__.

           

          Valid range: 100 - 300 MiB/s

          
        

        - **AvailabilityZoneId** *(string) --* 

          The ID of the Availability Zone where the EBS volume will be created (for example, ``use1-az1``).

           

          Either ``AvailabilityZone`` or ``AvailabilityZoneId`` can be specified, but not both. If neither is specified, Amazon EC2 automatically selects an Availability Zone within the Region.

           

          This parameter is not supported when using `CreateFleet <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_CreateFleet.html>`__, `CreateImage <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_CreateImage.html>`__, `DescribeImages <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeImages.html>`__, `RequestSpotFleet <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_RequestSpotFleet.html>`__, `RequestSpotInstances <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_RequestSpotInstances.html>`__, and `RunInstances <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_RunInstances.html>`__.

          
        

        - **EbsCardIndex** *(integer) --* 

          The index of the EBS card. Some instance types support multiple EBS cards. The default EBS card index is 0.

          
    
      

      - **NoDevice** *(string) --* 

        To omit the device from the block device mapping, specify an empty string. When this property is specified, the device is removed from the block device mapping regardless of the assigned value.

        
      

      - **DeviceName** *(string) --* 

        The device name. For available device names, see `Device names for volumes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/device_naming.html>`__.

        
      

      - **VirtualName** *(string) --* 

        The virtual device name ( ``ephemeral``N). Instance store volumes are numbered starting from 0. An instance type with 2 available instance store volumes can specify mappings for ``ephemeral0`` and ``ephemeral1``. The number of available instance store volumes depends on the instance type. After you connect to the instance, you must mount the volume.

         

        NVMe instance store volumes are automatically enumerated and assigned a device name. Including them in your block device mapping has no effect.

         

        Constraints: For M3 instances, you must specify instance store volumes in the block device mapping for the instance. When you launch an M3 instance, we ignore any instance store volumes specified in the block device mapping for the AMI.
