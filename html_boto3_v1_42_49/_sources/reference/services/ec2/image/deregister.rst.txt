.. py:method:: EC2.Image.deregister(**kwargs)

  

  Deregisters the specified AMI. A deregistered AMI can't be used to launch new instances.

   

  If a deregistered EBS-backed AMI matches a Recycle Bin retention rule, it moves to the Recycle Bin for the specified retention period. It can be restored before its retention period expires, after which it is permanently deleted. If the deregistered AMI doesn't match a retention rule, it is permanently deleted immediately. For more information, see `Recover deleted Amazon EBS snapshots and EBS-backed AMIs with Recycle Bin <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/recycle-bin.html>`__ in the *Amazon EBS User Guide*.

   

  When deregistering an EBS-backed AMI, you can optionally delete its associated snapshots at the same time. However, if a snapshot is associated with multiple AMIs, it won't be deleted even if specified for deletion, although the AMI will still be deregistered.

   

  Deregistering an AMI does not delete the following:

   

  
  * Instances already launched from the AMI. You'll continue to incur usage costs for the instances until you terminate them.
   
  * For EBS-backed AMIs: Snapshots that are associated with multiple AMIs. You'll continue to incur snapshot storage costs.
   
  * For instance store-backed AMIs: The files uploaded to Amazon S3 during AMI creation. You'll continue to incur S3 storage costs.
  

   

  For more information, see `Deregister an Amazon EC2 AMI <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/deregister-ami.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = image.deregister(
        DeleteAssociatedSnapshots=True|False,
        DryRun=True|False
    )
    
  :type DeleteAssociatedSnapshots: boolean
  :param DeleteAssociatedSnapshots: 

    Specifies whether to delete the snapshots associated with the AMI during deregistration.

     

    .. note::

      

      If a snapshot is associated with multiple AMIs, it is not deleted, regardless of this setting.

      

     

    Default: The snapshots are not deleted.

    

  
  :type DryRun: boolean
  :param DryRun: 

    Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is ``DryRunOperation``. Otherwise, it is ``UnauthorizedOperation``.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **Return** *(boolean) --* 

        Returns ``true`` if the request succeeds; otherwise, it returns an error.

        
      

      - **DeleteSnapshotResults** *(list) --* 

        The deletion result for each snapshot associated with the AMI, including the snapshot ID and its success or error code.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          The snapshot ID and its deletion result code.

          
          

          - **SnapshotId** *(string) --* 

            The ID of the snapshot.

            
          

          - **ReturnCode** *(string) --* 

            The result code from the snapshot deletion attempt. Possible values:

             

            
            * ``success`` - The snapshot was successfully deleted.
             
            * ``skipped`` - The snapshot was not deleted because it's associated with other AMIs.
             
            * ``missing-permissions`` - The snapshot was not deleted because the role lacks ``DeleteSnapshot`` permissions. For more information, see `How Amazon EBS works with IAM <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/security_iam_service-with-iam.html>`__.
             
            * ``internal-error`` - The snapshot was not deleted due to a server error.
             
            * ``client-error`` - The snapshot was not deleted due to a client configuration error.
            

             

            For details about an error, check the ``DeleteSnapshot`` event in the CloudTrail event history. For more information, see `View event history <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/tutorial-event-history.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services CloudTrail User Guide*.
