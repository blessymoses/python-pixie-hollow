    )
    
  :type CapacityReservationIds: list
  :param CapacityReservationIds: 

    The IDs of Capacity Block reservations that you want to display the history for.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    The token to use to retrieve the next page of results.

    

  
  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    The maximum number of items to return for this request. To get the next page of items, make another request with the token returned in the output. For more information, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Query-Requests.html#api-pagination>`__.

    

  
  :type Filters: list
  :param Filters: 

    One or more filters

     

    
    * ``availability-zone`` - The Availability Zone of the extension.
     
    * ``availability-zone-id`` - The Availability Zone ID of the extension.
     
    * ``capacity-block-extension-offering-id`` - The ID of the extension offering.
     
    * ``capacity-block-extension-status`` - The status of the extension ( ``payment-pending`` | ``payment-failed`` | ``payment-succeeded``).
     
    * ``capacity-reservation-id`` - The reservation ID of the extension.
     
    * ``instance-type`` - The instance type of the extension.
    

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more specific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be used to match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as tags, attributes, or IDs.

       

      If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an ``AND``, and the request returns only results that match all of the specified filters.

       

      For more information, see `List and filter using the CLI and API <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Filtering.html#Filtering_Resources_CLI>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

      

    
      - **Name** *(string) --*

      - **Values** *(list) --* 

        The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you specify multiple values for a filter, the values are joined with an ``OR``, and the request returns all results that match any of the specified values.

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
    
    

  :type DryRun: boolean
  :param DryRun: 

    Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is ``DryRunOperation``. Otherwise, it is ``UnauthorizedOperation``.
