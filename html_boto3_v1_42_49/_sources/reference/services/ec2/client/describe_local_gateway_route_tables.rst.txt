        DryRun=True|False
    )
    
  :type LocalGatewayRouteTableIds: list
  :param LocalGatewayRouteTableIds: 

    The IDs of the local gateway route tables.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type Filters: list
  :param Filters: 

    One or more filters.

     

    
    * ``local-gateway-id`` - The ID of a local gateway.
     
    * ``local-gateway-route-table-arn`` - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the local gateway route table.
     
    * ``local-gateway-route-table-id`` - The ID of a local gateway route table.
     
    * ``outpost-arn`` - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Outpost.
     
    * ``owner-id`` - The ID of the Amazon Web Services account that owns the local gateway route table.
     
    * ``state`` - The state of the local gateway route table.
    

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more specific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be used to match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as tags, attributes, or IDs.

       

      If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an ``AND``, and the request returns only results that match all of the specified filters.

       

      For more information, see `List and filter using the CLI and API <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Filtering.html#Filtering_Resources_CLI>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

      

    
      - **Name** *(string) --* 

        The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

        

      
      - **Values** *(list) --* 

        The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you specify multiple values for a filter, the values are joined with an ``OR``, and the request returns all results that match any of the specified values.

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
    
    

  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    The maximum number of results to return with a single call. To retrieve the remaining results, make another call with the returned ``nextToken`` value.

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    The token for the next page of results.

    

  
  :type DryRun: boolean
  :param DryRun: 

    Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is ``DryRunOperation``. Otherwise, it is ``UnauthorizedOperation``.
