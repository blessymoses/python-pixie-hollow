.. py:method:: EC2.Client.report_instance_status(**kwargs)

  

  Submits feedback about the status of an instance. The instance must be in the ``running`` state. If your experience with the instance differs from the instance status returned by  DescribeInstanceStatus, use  ReportInstanceStatus to report your experience with the instance. Amazon EC2 collects this information to improve the accuracy of status checks.

   

  Use of this action does not change the value returned by  DescribeInstanceStatus.
