.. py:method:: EC2.Client.release_address(**kwargs)

  

  Releases the specified Elastic IP address.

   

  [Default VPC] Releasing an Elastic IP address automatically disassociates it from any instance that it's associated with. Alternatively, you can disassociate an Elastic IP address without releasing it.

   

  [Nondefault VPC] You must disassociate the Elastic IP address before you can release it. Otherwise, Amazon EC2 returns an error ( ``InvalidIPAddress.InUse``).

   

  After releasing an Elastic IP address, it is released to the IP address pool. Be sure to update your DNS records and any servers or devices that communicate with the address. If you attempt to release an Elastic IP address that you already released, you'll get an ``AuthFailure`` error if the address is already allocated to another Amazon Web Services account.

   

  After you release an Elastic IP address, you might be able to recover it. For more information, see `Release an Elastic IP address <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-instance-addressing-eips-releasing.html>`__.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.release_address(
        AllocationId='string',
        PublicIp='string',
        NetworkBorderGroup='string',
        DryRun=True|False
    )
    
  :type AllocationId: string
  :param AllocationId: 

    The allocation ID. This parameter is required.

    

  
  :type PublicIp: string
  :param PublicIp: 

    Deprecated.

    

  
  :type NetworkBorderGroup: string
  :param NetworkBorderGroup: 

    The set of Availability Zones, Local Zones, or Wavelength Zones from which Amazon Web Services advertises IP addresses.

     

    If you provide an incorrect network border group, you receive an ``InvalidAddress.NotFound`` error.

    

  
  :type DryRun: boolean
  :param DryRun: 

    Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is ``DryRunOperation``. Otherwise, it is ``UnauthorizedOperation``.

    

  
  
  :returns: None

  **Examples**

  This example releases an Elastic IP address for use with instances in a VPC.
  ::

    response = client.release_address(
        AllocationId='eipalloc-64d5890a',
    )
    
    print(response)

  
  Expected Output:
  ::

    {
        'ResponseMetadata': {
            '...': '...',
        },
    }

  

  This example releases an Elastic IP address for use with instances in EC2-Classic.
  ::

    response = client.release_address(
        PublicIp='198.51.100.0',
    )
    
    print(response)

  
  Expected Output:
  ::

    {
        'ResponseMetadata': {
