.. py:method:: EC2.Client.create_ipam_pool(**kwargs)

  

  Create an IP address pool for Amazon VPC IP Address Manager (IPAM). In IPAM, a pool is a collection of contiguous IP addresses CIDRs. Pools enable you to organize your IP addresses according to your routing and security needs. For example, if you have separate routing and security needs for development and production applications, you can create a pool for each.

   

  For more information, see `Create a top-level pool <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/ipam/create-top-ipam.html>`__ in the *Amazon VPC IPAM User Guide*.

    )
    
  :type DryRun: boolean
  :param DryRun: 

    A check for whether you have the required permissions for the action without actually making the request and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is ``DryRunOperation``. Otherwise, it is ``UnauthorizedOperation``.

    

  
  :type IpamScopeId: string
  :param IpamScopeId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ID of the scope in which you would like to create the IPAM pool.

    

  
  :type Locale: string
  :param Locale: 

    The locale for the pool should be one of the following:

     

    
    * An Amazon Web Services Region where you want this IPAM pool to be available for allocations.
     
    * The network border group for an Amazon Web Services Local Zone where you want this IPAM pool to be available for allocations ( `supported Local Zones <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-byoip.html#byoip-zone-avail>`__). This option is only available for IPAM IPv4 pools in the public scope.
    

     

    Possible values: Any Amazon Web Services Region or supported Amazon Web Services Local Zone. Default is ``none`` and means any locale.

    

  
  :type SourceIpamPoolId: string
  :param SourceIpamPoolId: 

    The ID of the source IPAM pool. Use this option to create a pool within an existing pool. Note that the CIDR you provision for the pool within the source pool must be available in the source pool's CIDR range.

    

  
  :type Description: string
  :param Description: 

    A description for the IPAM pool.

    

  
  :type AddressFamily: string
  :param AddressFamily: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The IP protocol assigned to this IPAM pool. You must choose either IPv4 or IPv6 protocol for a pool.

    

  
  :type AutoImport: boolean
  :param AutoImport: 

    If selected, IPAM will continuously look for resources within the CIDR range of this pool and automatically import them as allocations into your IPAM. The CIDRs that will be allocated for these resources must not already be allocated to other resources in order for the import to succeed. IPAM will import a CIDR regardless of its compliance with the pool's allocation rules, so a resource might be imported and subsequently marked as noncompliant. If IPAM discovers multiple CIDRs that overlap, IPAM will import the largest CIDR only. If IPAM discovers multiple CIDRs with matching CIDRs, IPAM will randomly import one of them only.

     

    A locale must be set on the pool for this feature to work.

    

  
  :type PubliclyAdvertisable: boolean
  :param PubliclyAdvertisable: 

    Determines if the pool is publicly advertisable. The request can only contain ``PubliclyAdvertisable`` if ``AddressFamily`` is ``ipv6`` and ``PublicIpSource`` is ``byoip``.

    

  
  :type AllocationMinNetmaskLength: integer
  :param AllocationMinNetmaskLength: 

    The minimum netmask length required for CIDR allocations in this IPAM pool to be compliant. The minimum netmask length must be less than the maximum netmask length. Possible netmask lengths for IPv4 addresses are 0 - 32. Possible netmask lengths for IPv6 addresses are 0 - 128.

    

  
  :type AllocationMaxNetmaskLength: integer
  :param AllocationMaxNetmaskLength: 

    The maximum netmask length possible for CIDR allocations in this IPAM pool to be compliant. The maximum netmask length must be greater than the minimum netmask length. Possible netmask lengths for IPv4 addresses are 0 - 32. Possible netmask lengths for IPv6 addresses are 0 - 128.

    

  
  :type AllocationDefaultNetmaskLength: integer
  :param AllocationDefaultNetmaskLength: 

    The default netmask length for allocations added to this pool. If, for example, the CIDR assigned to this pool is 10.0.0.0/8 and you enter 16 here, new allocations will default to 10.0.0.0/16.

    

  
  :type AllocationResourceTags: list
  :param AllocationResourceTags: 

    Tags that are required for resources that use CIDRs from this IPAM pool. Resources that do not have these tags will not be allowed to allocate space from the pool. If the resources have their tags changed after they have allocated space or if the allocation tagging requirements are changed on the pool, the resource may be marked as noncompliant.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      A tag on an IPAM resource.

      

    
      - **Key** *(string) --*

      - **Value** *(string) --* 

        The value for the tag.

        

      
    

  :type TagSpecifications: list
  :param TagSpecifications: 

    The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key ``Owner`` and the value ``TeamA``, specify ``tag:Owner`` for the filter name and ``TeamA`` for the filter value.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      The tags to apply to a resource when the resource is being created. When you specify a tag, you must specify the resource type to tag, otherwise the request will fail.

       

      .. note::

        

        The ``Valid Values`` lists all the resource types that can be tagged. However, the action you're using might not support tagging all of these resource types. If you try to tag a resource type that is unsupported for the action you're using, you'll get an error.

        

      

    
      - **ResourceType** *(string) --* 

        The type of resource to tag on creation.

            Constraints: Tag values are case-sensitive and accept a maximum of 256 Unicode characters.

            

          
        
    
    

  :type ClientToken: string
  :param ClientToken: 

    A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency of the request. For more information, see `Ensuring idempotency <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/devguide/ec2-api-idempotency.html>`__.

    This field is autopopulated if not provided.

  
  :type AwsService: string
  :param AwsService: 

    Limits which service in Amazon Web Services that the pool can be used in. "ec2", for example, allows users to use space for Elastic IP addresses and VPCs.
