.. py:method:: EC2.Client.delete_client_vpn_route(**kwargs)

  

  Deletes a route from a Client VPN endpoint. You can only delete routes that you manually added using the **CreateClientVpnRoute** action. You cannot delete routes that were automatically added when associating a subnet. To remove routes that have been automatically added, disassociate the target subnet from the Client VPN endpoint.
