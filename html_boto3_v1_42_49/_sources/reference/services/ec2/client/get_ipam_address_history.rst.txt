  ::

    response = client.get_ipam_address_history(
        DryRun=True|False,
        Cidr='string',
        IpamScopeId='string',
        VpcId='string',
        StartTime=datetime(2015, 1, 1),
        EndTime=datetime(2015, 1, 1),
        MaxResults=123,
        NextToken='string'
    )
    
  :type DryRun: boolean
  :param DryRun: 

    A check for whether you have the required permissions for the action without actually making the request and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is ``DryRunOperation``. Otherwise, it is ``UnauthorizedOperation``.

    

  
  :type Cidr: string
  :param Cidr: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The CIDR you want the history of. The CIDR can be an IPv4 or IPv6 IP address range. If you enter a /16 IPv4 CIDR, you will get records that match it exactly. You will not get records for any subnets within the /16 CIDR.

    

  
  :type IpamScopeId: string
  :param IpamScopeId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ID of the IPAM scope that the CIDR is in.

    

  
  :type VpcId: string
  :param VpcId: 

    The ID of the VPC you want your history records filtered by.

    

  
  :type StartTime: datetime
  :param StartTime: 

    The start of the time period for which you are looking for history. If you omit this option, it will default to the value of EndTime.

    

  
  :type EndTime: datetime
  :param EndTime: 

    The end of the time period for which you are looking for history. If you omit this option, it will default to the current time.

    

  
  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    The maximum number of historical results you would like returned per page. Defaults to 100.

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    The token for the next page of results.

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **HistoryRecords** *(list) --* 

        A historical record for a CIDR within an IPAM scope. If the CIDR is associated with an EC2 instance, you will see an object in the response for the instance and one for the network interface.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          The historical record of a CIDR within an IPAM scope. For more information, see `View the history of IP addresses <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/ipam/view-history-cidr-ipam.html>`__ in the *Amazon VPC IPAM User Guide*.

          - **ResourceName** *(string) --* 

            The name of the resource.

            
          

          - **ResourceComplianceStatus** *(string) --* 

            The compliance status of a resource. For more information on compliance statuses, see `Monitor CIDR usage by resource <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/ipam/monitor-cidr-compliance-ipam.html>`__ in the *Amazon VPC IPAM User Guide*.

            
          

          - **ResourceOverlapStatus** *(string) --* 

            The overlap status of an IPAM resource. The overlap status tells you if the CIDR for a resource overlaps with another CIDR in the scope.

          - **SampledStartTime** *(datetime) --* 

            Sampled start time of the resource-to-CIDR association within the IPAM scope. Changes are picked up in periodic snapshots, so the start time may have occurred before this specific time.

            
          

          - **SampledEndTime** *(datetime) --* 

            Sampled end time of the resource-to-CIDR association within the IPAM scope. Changes are picked up in periodic snapshots, so the end time may have occurred before this specific time.

            
      
    
      

      - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

        The token to use to retrieve the next page of results. This value is ``null`` when there are no more results to return.
