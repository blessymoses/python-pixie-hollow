.. py:method:: EC2.Client.describe_address_transfers(**kwargs)

  

  Describes an Elastic IP address transfer. For more information, see `Transfer Elastic IP addresses <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-eips.html#transfer-EIPs-intro>`__ in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*.

   

  When you transfer an Elastic IP address, there is a two-step handshake between the source and transfer Amazon Web Services accounts. When the source account starts the transfer, the transfer account has seven days to accept the Elastic IP address transfer. During those seven days, the source account can view the pending transfer by using this action. After seven days, the transfer expires and ownership of the Elastic IP address returns to the source account. Accepted transfers are visible to the source account for 14 days after the transfers have been accepted.

        ],
        NextToken='string',
        MaxResults=123,
        DryRun=True|False
    )
    
  :type AllocationIds: list
  :param AllocationIds: 

    The allocation IDs of Elastic IP addresses.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    Specify the pagination token from a previous request to retrieve the next page of results.

    

  
  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    The maximum number of address transfers to return in one page of results.

    

  
  :type DryRun: boolean
  :param DryRun: 

    Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is ``DryRunOperation``. Otherwise, it is ``UnauthorizedOperation``.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **AddressTransfers** *(list) --* 

        The Elastic IP address transfer.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          Details on the Elastic IP address transfer. For more information, see `Transfer Elastic IP addresses <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-eips.html#transfer-EIPs-intro>`__ in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*.

          
          

          - **PublicIp** *(string) --* 

            The Elastic IP address being transferred.

            
          

          - **AllocationId** *(string) --* 

            The allocation ID of an Elastic IP address.

            
          

          - **TransferAccountId** *(string) --* 

            The ID of the account that you want to transfer the Elastic IP address to.
