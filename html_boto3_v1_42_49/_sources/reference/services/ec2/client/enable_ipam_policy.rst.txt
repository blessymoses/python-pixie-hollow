.. py:method:: EC2.Client.enable_ipam_policy(**kwargs)

  

  Enables an IPAM policy.

   

  An IPAM policy is a set of rules that define how public IPv4 addresses from IPAM pools are allocated to Amazon Web Services resources. Each rule maps an Amazon Web Services service to IPAM pools that the service will use to get IP addresses. A single policy can have multiple rules and be applied to multiple Amazon Web Services Regions. If the IPAM pool run out of addresses then the services fallback to Amazon-provided IP addresses. A policy can be applied to an individual Amazon Web Services account or an entity within Amazon Web Services Organizations.

   

  For more information, see `Define public IPv4 allocation strategy with IPAM policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/ipam/define-public-ipv4-allocation-strategy-with-ipam-policies.html>`__ in the *Amazon VPC IPAM User Guide*.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.enable_ipam_policy(
        DryRun=True|False,
        IpamPolicyId='string',
        OrganizationTargetId='string'
    )
    
  :type DryRun: boolean
  :param DryRun: 

    A check for whether you have the required permissions for the action without actually making the request and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is ``DryRunOperation``. Otherwise, it is ``UnauthorizedOperation``.

    

  
  :type IpamPolicyId: string
  :param IpamPolicyId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ID of the IPAM policy to enable.

    

  
  :type OrganizationTargetId: string
  :param OrganizationTargetId: 

    The ID of the Amazon Web Services Organizations target for which to enable the IPAM policy. This parameter is required only when IPAM is integrated with Amazon Web Services Organizations. When IPAM is not integrated with Amazon Web Services Organizations, omit this parameter and the policy will apply to the current account.

     

    A target can be an individual Amazon Web Services account or an entity within an Amazon Web Services Organization to which an IPAM policy can be applied.
