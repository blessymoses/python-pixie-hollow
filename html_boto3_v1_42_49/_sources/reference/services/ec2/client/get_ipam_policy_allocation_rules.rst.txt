.. py:method:: EC2.Client.get_ipam_policy_allocation_rules(**kwargs)

  

  Gets the allocation rules for an IPAM policy.

   

  An IPAM policy is a set of rules that define how public IPv4 addresses from IPAM pools are allocated to Amazon Web Services resources. Each rule maps an Amazon Web Services service to IPAM pools that the service will use to get IP addresses. A single policy can have multiple rules and be applied to multiple Amazon Web Services Regions. If the IPAM pool run out of addresses then the services fallback to Amazon-provided IP addresses. A policy can be applied to an individual Amazon Web Services account or an entity within Amazon Web Services Organizations.

   

  Allocation rules are optional configurations within an IPAM policy that map Amazon Web Services resource types to specific IPAM pools. If no rules are defined, the resource types default to using Amazon-provided IP addresses.

    )
    
  :type DryRun: boolean
  :param DryRun: 

    A check for whether you have the required permissions for the action without actually making the request and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is ``DryRunOperation``. Otherwise, it is ``UnauthorizedOperation``.

    

  
  :type IpamPolicyId: string
  :param IpamPolicyId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ID of the IPAM policy for which to get allocation rules.

    

  
  :type Filters: list
  :param Filters: 

    One or more filters for the allocation rules.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more specific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be used to match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as tags, attributes, or IDs.

       

      If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an ``AND``, and the request returns only results that match all of the specified filters.

       

      For more information, see `List and filter using the CLI and API <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Filtering.html#Filtering_Resources_CLI>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

      

    
      - **Name** *(string) --* 

        The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

        

      
      - **Values** *(list) --* 

        The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you specify multiple values for a filter, the values are joined with an ``OR``, and the request returns all results that match any of the specified values.

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
    
    

  :type Locale: string
  :param Locale: 

    The locale for which to get the allocation rules.

    

  
  :type ResourceType: string
  :param ResourceType: 

    The resource type for which to get the allocation rules.

     

    The Amazon Web Services service or resource type that can use IP addresses through IPAM policies. Supported services and resource types include:

     

    
    * Elastic IP addresses
    

    

  
  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    The maximum number of results to return in a single call.

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    The token for the next page of results.
