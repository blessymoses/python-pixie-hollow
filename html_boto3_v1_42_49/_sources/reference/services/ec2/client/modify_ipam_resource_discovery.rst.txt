  :type DryRun: boolean
  :param DryRun: 

    A check for whether you have the required permissions for the action without actually making the request and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is ``DryRunOperation``. Otherwise, it is ``UnauthorizedOperation``.

  :param IpamResourceDiscoveryId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A resource discovery ID.

  :param Description: 

    A resource discovery description.

    

  
  :type AddOperatingRegions: list
  :param AddOperatingRegions: 

    Add operating Regions to the resource discovery. Operating Regions are Amazon Web Services Regions where the IPAM is allowed to manage IP address CIDRs. IPAM only discovers and monitors resources in the Amazon Web Services Regions you select as operating Regions.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      Add an operating Region to an IPAM. Operating Regions are Amazon Web Services Regions where the IPAM is allowed to manage IP address CIDRs. IPAM only discovers and monitors resources in the Amazon Web Services Regions you select as operating Regions.

       

      For more information about operating Regions, see `Create an IPAM <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/ipam/create-ipam.html>`__ in the *Amazon VPC IPAM User Guide*.

    - *(dict) --* 

      Remove an operating Region from an IPAM. Operating Regions are Amazon Web Services Regions where the IPAM is allowed to manage IP address CIDRs. IPAM only discovers and monitors resources in the Amazon Web Services Regions you select as operating Regions.

       

      For more information about operating Regions, see `Create an IPAM <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/ipam/create-ipam.html>`__ in the *Amazon VPC IPAM User Guide*

  :type AddOrganizationalUnitExclusions: list
  :param AddOrganizationalUnitExclusions: 

    Add an Organizational Unit (OU) exclusion to your IPAM. If your IPAM is integrated with Amazon Web Services Organizations and you add an organizational unit (OU) exclusion, IPAM will not manage the IP addresses in accounts in that OU exclusion. There is a limit on the number of exclusions you can create. For more information, see `Quotas for your IPAM <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/ipam/quotas-ipam.html>`__ in the *Amazon VPC IPAM User Guide*.

     

    .. note::

      

      The resulting set of exclusions must not result in "overlap", meaning two or more OU exclusions must not exclude the same OU.
