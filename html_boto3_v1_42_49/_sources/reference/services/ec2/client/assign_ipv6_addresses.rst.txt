.. py:method:: EC2.Client.assign_ipv6_addresses(**kwargs)

  

  Assigns the specified IPv6 addresses to the specified network interface. You can specify specific IPv6 addresses, or you can specify the number of IPv6 addresses to be automatically assigned from the subnet's IPv6 CIDR block range. You can assign as many IPv6 addresses to a network interface as you can assign private IPv4 addresses, and the limit varies by instance type.

   

  You must specify either the IPv6 addresses or the IPv6 address count in the request.

   

  You can optionally use Prefix Delegation on the network interface. You must specify either the IPV6 Prefix Delegation prefixes, or the IPv6 Prefix Delegation count. For information, see `Assigning prefixes to network interfaces <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-prefix-eni.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.assign_ipv6_addresses(
        Ipv6PrefixCount=123,
        Ipv6Prefixes=[
            'string',
        ],
        NetworkInterfaceId='string',
        Ipv6Addresses=[
            'string',
        ],
        Ipv6AddressCount=123
    )
    
  :type Ipv6PrefixCount: integer
  :param Ipv6PrefixCount: 

    The number of IPv6 prefixes that Amazon Web Services automatically assigns to the network interface. You cannot use this option if you use the ``Ipv6Prefixes`` option.

    

  
  :type Ipv6Prefixes: list
  :param Ipv6Prefixes: 

    One or more IPv6 prefixes assigned to the network interface. You can't use this option if you use the ``Ipv6PrefixCount`` option.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type NetworkInterfaceId: string
  :param NetworkInterfaceId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ID of the network interface.

    

  
  :type Ipv6Addresses: list
  :param Ipv6Addresses: 

    The IPv6 addresses to be assigned to the network interface. You can't use this option if you're specifying a number of IPv6 addresses.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type Ipv6AddressCount: integer
  :param Ipv6AddressCount: 

    The number of additional IPv6 addresses to assign to the network interface. The specified number of IPv6 addresses are assigned in addition to the existing IPv6 addresses that are already assigned to the network interface. Amazon EC2 automatically selects the IPv6 addresses from the subnet range. You can't use this option if specifying specific IPv6 addresses.
