          * ``targeted`` - The Capacity Reservation only accepts instances that have matching attributes (instance type, platform, and Availability Zone), and explicitly target the Capacity Reservation. This ensures that only permitted instances can use the reserved capacity.

      - **CapacityBlocks** *(list) --* 

        The Capacity Block.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          Reserve powerful GPU instances on a future date to support your short duration machine learning (ML) workloads. Instances that run inside a Capacity Block are automatically placed close together inside `Amazon EC2 UltraClusters <http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/ultraclusters/>`__, for low-latency, petabit-scale, non-blocking networking.

           

          You can also reserve Amazon EC2 UltraServers. UltraServers connect multiple EC2 instances using a low-latency, high-bandwidth accelerator interconnect (NeuronLink). They are built to tackle very large-scale AI/ML workloads that require significant processing power. For more information, see Amazon EC2 UltraServers.
