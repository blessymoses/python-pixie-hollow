.. py:method:: EC2.Client.describe_host_reservation_offerings(**kwargs)

  

  Describes the Dedicated Host reservations that are available to purchase.

   

  The results describe all of the Dedicated Host reservation offerings, including offerings that might not match the instance family and Region of your Dedicated Hosts. When purchasing an offering, ensure that the instance family and Region of the offering matches that of the Dedicated Hosts with which it is to be associated. For more information about supported instance types, see `Dedicated Hosts <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/dedicated-hosts-overview.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

        NextToken='string',
        OfferingId='string'
    )
    
  :type Filters: list
  :param Filters: 

    The filters.

     

    
    * ``instance-family`` - The instance family of the offering (for example, ``m4``).
     
    * ``payment-option`` - The payment option ( ``NoUpfront`` | ``PartialUpfront`` | ``AllUpfront``).
    

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more specific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be used to match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as tags, attributes, or IDs.

       

      If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an ``AND``, and the request returns only results that match all of the specified filters.

       

      For more information, see `List and filter using the CLI and API <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Filtering.html#Filtering_Resources_CLI>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

      

    
      - **Name** *(string) --* 

        The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

        

      
      - **Values** *(list) --* 

        The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you specify multiple values for a filter, the values are joined with an ``OR``, and the request returns all results that match any of the specified values.

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
    
    

  :type MaxDuration: integer
  :param MaxDuration: 

    This is the maximum duration of the reservation to purchase, specified in seconds. Reservations are available in one-year and three-year terms. The number of seconds specified must be the number of seconds in a year (365x24x60x60) times one of the supported durations (1 or 3). For example, specify 94608000 for three years.

    

  
  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    The maximum number of results to return for the request in a single page. The remaining results can be seen by sending another request with the returned ``nextToken`` value. This value can be between 5 and 500. If ``maxResults`` is given a larger value than 500, you receive an error.

    

  
  :type MinDuration: integer
  :param MinDuration: 

    This is the minimum duration of the reservation you'd like to purchase, specified in seconds. Reservations are available in one-year and three-year terms. The number of seconds specified must be the number of seconds in a year (365x24x60x60) times one of the supported durations (1 or 3). For example, specify 31536000 for one year.
