.. py:method:: EC2.Client.disable_allowed_images_settings(**kwargs)

  

  Disables Allowed AMIs for your account in the specified Amazon Web Services Region. When set to ``disabled``, the image criteria in your Allowed AMIs settings do not apply, and no restrictions are placed on AMI discoverability or usage. Users in your account can launch instances using any public AMI or AMI shared with your account.

   

  .. note::

    

    The Allowed AMIs feature does not restrict the AMIs owned by your account. Regardless of the criteria you set, the AMIs created by your account will always be discoverable and usable by users in your account.

    

   

  For more information, see `Control the discovery and use of AMIs in Amazon EC2 with Allowed AMIs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-allowed-amis.html>`__ in *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.
