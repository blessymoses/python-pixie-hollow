    response = client.describe_host_reservations(
        Filters=[
            {
                'Name': 'string',
                'Values': [
                    'string',

        NextToken='string'
    )
    
  :type Filters: list
  :param Filters: 

    The filters.

     

    
    * ``instance-family`` - The instance family (for example, ``m4``).
     
    * ``payment-option`` - The payment option ( ``NoUpfront`` | ``PartialUpfront`` | ``AllUpfront``).
     
    * ``state`` - The state of the reservation ( ``payment-pending`` | ``payment-failed`` | ``active`` | ``retired``).
     
    * ``tag:<key>`` - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key ``Owner`` and the value ``TeamA``, specify ``tag:Owner`` for the filter name and ``TeamA`` for the filter value.
     
    * ``tag-key`` - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, regardless of the tag value.
    

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more specific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be used to match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as tags, attributes, or IDs.

       

      If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an ``AND``, and the request returns only results that match all of the specified filters.

       

      For more information, see `List and filter using the CLI and API <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Filtering.html#Filtering_Resources_CLI>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

      

    
      - **Name** *(string) --* 

        The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

        

      
      - **Values** *(list) --* 

        The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you specify multiple values for a filter, the values are joined with an ``OR``, and the request returns all results that match any of the specified values.

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
    
    

  :type HostReservationIdSet: list
  :param HostReservationIdSet: 

    The host reservation IDs.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    The maximum number of results to return for the request in a single page. The remaining results can be seen by sending another request with the returned ``nextToken`` value. This value can be between 5 and 500. If ``maxResults`` is given a larger value than 500, you receive an error.

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    The token to use to retrieve the next page of results.
