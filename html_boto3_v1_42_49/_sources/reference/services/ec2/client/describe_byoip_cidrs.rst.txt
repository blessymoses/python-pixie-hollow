  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.describe_byoip_cidrs(
        DryRun=True|False,
        MaxResults=123,
        NextToken='string'
    )
    
  :type DryRun: boolean
  :param DryRun: 

    Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is ``DryRunOperation``. Otherwise, it is ``UnauthorizedOperation``.

    

  
  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The maximum number of results to return with a single call. To retrieve the remaining results, make another call with the returned ``nextToken`` value.

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    The token for the next page of results.

            * ``pending-deprovision``: You’ve submitted a request to deprovision an address range and it's pending.

          - **NetworkBorderGroup** *(string) --* 

            If you have `Local Zones <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/local-zones/latest/ug/how-local-zones-work.html>`__ enabled, you can choose a network border group for Local Zones when you provision and advertise a BYOIPv4 CIDR. Choose the network border group carefully as the EIP and the Amazon Web Services resource it is associated with must reside in the same network border group.

             

            You can provision BYOIP address ranges to and advertise them in the following Local Zone network border groups:

             

            
            * us-east-1-dfw-2
             
            * us-west-2-lax-1
             
            * us-west-2-phx-2
            

             

            .. note::

              

              You cannot provision or advertise BYOIPv6 address ranges in Local Zones at this time.

              

            
          

          - **AdvertisementType** *(string) --* 

            Specifies the advertisement method for the BYOIP CIDR. Valid values are:

             

            
            * ``unicast``: IP is advertised from a single location (regional services like EC2)
             
            * ``anycast``: IP is advertised from multiple global locations simultaneously (global services like CloudFront)
            

             

            For more information, see `Bring your own IP to CloudFront using IPAM <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/ipam/tutorials-byoip-cloudfront.html>`__ in the *Amazon VPC IPAM User Guide*.

            
      
    
      

      - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

        The token to use to retrieve the next page of results. This value is ``null`` when there are no more results to return.
