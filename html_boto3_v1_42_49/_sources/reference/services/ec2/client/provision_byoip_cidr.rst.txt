.. py:method:: EC2.Client.provision_byoip_cidr(**kwargs)

  

  Provisions an IPv4 or IPv6 address range for use with your Amazon Web Services resources through bring your own IP addresses (BYOIP) and creates a corresponding address pool. After the address range is provisioned, it is ready to be advertised.

   

  Amazon Web Services verifies that you own the address range and are authorized to advertise it. You must ensure that the address range is registered to you and that you created an RPKI ROA to authorize Amazon ASNs 16509 and 14618 to advertise the address range. For more information, see `Bring your own IP addresses (BYOIP) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-byoip.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

   

  Provisioning an address range is an asynchronous operation, so the call returns immediately, but the address range is not ready to use until its status changes from ``pending-provision`` to ``provisioned``. For more information, see `Onboard your address range <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/byoip-onboard.html>`__.

  :type Cidr: string
  :param Cidr: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The public IPv4 or IPv6 address range, in CIDR notation. The most specific IPv4 prefix that you can specify is /24. The most specific IPv6 address range that you can bring is /48 for CIDRs that are publicly advertisable and /56 for CIDRs that are not publicly advertisable. The address range cannot overlap with another address range that you've brought to this or another Region.

    

  
  :type CidrAuthorizationContext: dict
  :param CidrAuthorizationContext: 

    A signed document that proves that you are authorized to bring the specified IP address range to Amazon using BYOIP.

    

  
    - **Message** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The plain-text authorization message for the prefix and account.

      

    
    - **Signature** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The signed authorization message for the prefix and account.

      

    
  
  :type PubliclyAdvertisable: boolean
  :param PubliclyAdvertisable: 

    (IPv6 only) Indicate whether the address range will be publicly advertised to the internet.

     

    Default: true

    

  
  :type Description: string
  :param Description: 

    A description for the address range and the address pool.

    

  
  :type DryRun: boolean
  :param DryRun: 

    Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is ``DryRunOperation``. Otherwise, it is ``UnauthorizedOperation``.

    

  
  :type PoolTagSpecifications: list
  :param PoolTagSpecifications: 

    The tags to apply to the address pool.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      The tags to apply to a resource when the resource is being created. When you specify a tag, you must specify the resource type to tag, otherwise the request will fail.

       

      .. note::

        

        The ``Valid Values`` lists all the resource types that can be tagged. However, the action you're using might not support tagging all of these resource types. If you try to tag a resource type that is unsupported for the action you're using, you'll get an error.

        

      

    
      - **ResourceType** *(string) --* 

        The type of resource to tag on creation.

        

      
      - **Tags** *(list) --* 

        The tags to apply to the resource.

        

      
        - *(dict) --* 

          Describes a tag.

          

        
          - **Key** *(string) --* 

            The key of the tag.

             

            Constraints: Tag keys are case-sensitive and accept a maximum of 127 Unicode characters. May not begin with ``aws:``.

            

          
          - **Value** *(string) --* 

            The value of the tag.

             

            Constraints: Tag values are case-sensitive and accept a maximum of 256 Unicode characters.

            

          
        
    
    

  :type MultiRegion: boolean
  :param MultiRegion:

  :type NetworkBorderGroup: string
  :param NetworkBorderGroup: 

    If you have `Local Zones <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/local-zones/latest/ug/how-local-zones-work.html>`__ enabled, you can choose a network border group for Local Zones when you provision and advertise a BYOIPv4 CIDR. Choose the network border group carefully as the EIP and the Amazon Web Services resource it is associated with must reside in the same network border group.

     

    You can provision BYOIP address ranges to and advertise them in the following Local Zone network border groups:

     

    
    * us-east-1-dfw-2
     
    * us-west-2-lax-1
     
    * us-west-2-phx-2
