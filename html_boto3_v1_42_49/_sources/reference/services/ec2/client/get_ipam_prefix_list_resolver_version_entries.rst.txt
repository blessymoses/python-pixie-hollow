  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.get_ipam_prefix_list_resolver_version_entries(
        DryRun=True|False,
        IpamPrefixListResolverId='string',
        IpamPrefixListResolverVersion=123,
        MaxResults=123,
        NextToken='string'
    )
    
  :type DryRun: boolean
  :param DryRun: 

    A check for whether you have the required permissions for the action without actually making the request and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is ``DryRunOperation``. Otherwise, it is ``UnauthorizedOperation``.

    

  
  :type IpamPrefixListResolverId: string
  :param IpamPrefixListResolverId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ID of the IPAM prefix list resolver whose version entries you want to retrieve.

    

  
  :type IpamPrefixListResolverVersion: integer
  :param IpamPrefixListResolverVersion: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The version number of the resolver for which to retrieve CIDR entries. If not specified, the latest version is used.

    

  
  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    The maximum number of items to return for this request. To get the next page of items, make another request with the token returned in the output. For more information, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Query-Requests.html#api-pagination>`__.

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    The token for the next page of results.
