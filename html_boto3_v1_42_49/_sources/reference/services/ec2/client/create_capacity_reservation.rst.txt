.. py:method:: EC2.Client.create_capacity_reservation(**kwargs)

  

  Creates a new Capacity Reservation with the specified attributes. Capacity Reservations enable you to reserve capacity for your Amazon EC2 instances in a specific Availability Zone for any duration.

   

  You can create a Capacity Reservation at any time, and you can choose when it starts. You can create a Capacity Reservation for immediate use or you can request a Capacity Reservation for a future date.

   

  For more information, see `Reserve compute capacity with On-Demand Capacity Reservations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-capacity-reservations.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

   

  Your request to create a Capacity Reservation could fail if:

   

  
  * Amazon EC2 does not have sufficient capacity. In this case, try again at a later time, try in a different Availability Zone, or request a smaller Capacity Reservation. If your workload is flexible across instance types and sizes, try with different instance attributes.
   
  * The requested quantity exceeds your On-Demand Instance quota. In this case, increase your On-Demand Instance quota for the requested instance type and try again. For more information, see `Amazon EC2 Service Quotas <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-resource-limits.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

  :type ClientToken: string
  :param ClientToken: 

    Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency of the request. For more information, see `Ensure Idempotency <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Run_Instance_Idempotency.html>`__.

    

  
  :type InstanceType: string
  :param InstanceType: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The instance type for which to reserve capacity.

     

    .. note::

      

      You can request future-dated Capacity Reservations for instance types in the C, M, R, I, T, and G instance families only.

      

     

    For more information, see `Instance types <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

    

  
  :type InstancePlatform: string
  :param InstancePlatform: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The type of operating system for which to reserve capacity.

    

  
  :type AvailabilityZone: string
  :param AvailabilityZone: 

    The Availability Zone in which to create the Capacity Reservation.

    

  
  :type AvailabilityZoneId: string
  :param AvailabilityZoneId: 

    The ID of the Availability Zone in which to create the Capacity Reservation.

    

  
  :type Tenancy: string
  :param Tenancy: 

    Indicates the tenancy of the Capacity Reservation. A Capacity Reservation can have one of the following tenancy settings:

     

    
    * ``default`` - The Capacity Reservation is created on hardware that is shared with other Amazon Web Services accounts.
     
    * ``dedicated`` - The Capacity Reservation is created on single-tenant hardware that is dedicated to a single Amazon Web Services account.
    

    

  
  :type InstanceCount: integer
  :param InstanceCount: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The number of instances for which to reserve capacity.

     

    .. note::

      

      You can request future-dated Capacity Reservations for an instance count with a minimum of 32 vCPUs. For example, if you request a future-dated Capacity Reservation for ``m5.xlarge`` instances, you must request at least 8 instances (*8 * m5.xlarge = 32 vCPUs*).

      

     

    Valid range: 1 - 1000

    

  
  :type EbsOptimized: boolean
  :param EbsOptimized: 

    Indicates whether the Capacity Reservation supports EBS-optimized instances. This optimization provides dedicated throughput to Amazon EBS and an optimized configuration stack to provide optimal I/O performance. This optimization isn't available with all instance types. Additional usage charges apply when using an EBS- optimized instance.

    

  
  :type EphemeralStorage: boolean
  :param EphemeralStorage: 

    *Deprecated.*

    

  
  :type EndDate: datetime
  :param EndDate: 

    The date and time at which the Capacity Reservation expires. When a Capacity Reservation expires, the reserved capacity is released and you can no longer launch instances into it. The Capacity Reservation's state changes to ``expired`` when it reaches its end date and time.

     

    You must provide an ``EndDate`` value if ``EndDateType`` is ``limited``. Omit ``EndDate`` if ``EndDateType`` is ``unlimited``.

     

    If the ``EndDateType`` is ``limited``, the Capacity Reservation is cancelled within an hour from the specified time. For example, if you specify 5/31/2019, 13:30:55, the Capacity Reservation is guaranteed to end between 13:30:55 and 14:30:55 on 5/31/2019.

     

    If you are requesting a future-dated Capacity Reservation, you can't specify an end date and time that is within the commitment duration.

    

  
  :type EndDateType: string
  :param EndDateType: 

    Indicates the way in which the Capacity Reservation ends. A Capacity Reservation can have one of the following end types:

     

    
    * ``unlimited`` - The Capacity Reservation remains active until you explicitly cancel it. Do not provide an ``EndDate`` if the ``EndDateType`` is ``unlimited``.
     
    * ``limited`` - The Capacity Reservation expires automatically at a specified date and time. You must provide an ``EndDate`` value if the ``EndDateType`` value is ``limited``.
    

    

  
  :type InstanceMatchCriteria: string
  :param InstanceMatchCriteria: 

    Indicates the type of instance launches that the Capacity Reservation accepts. The options include:

     

    
    * ``open`` - The Capacity Reservation automatically matches all instances that have matching attributes (instance type, platform, and Availability Zone). Instances that have matching attributes run in the Capacity Reservation automatically without specifying any additional parameters.
     
    * ``targeted`` - The Capacity Reservation only accepts instances that have matching attributes (instance type, platform, and Availability Zone), and explicitly target the Capacity Reservation. This ensures that only permitted instances can use the reserved capacity.
    

     

    .. note::

      

      If you are requesting a future-dated Capacity Reservation, you must specify ``targeted``.

      

     

    Default: ``open``

    

  
  :type TagSpecifications: list
  :param TagSpecifications: 

    The tags to apply to the Capacity Reservation during launch.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      The tags to apply to a resource when the resource is being created. When you specify a tag, you must specify the resource type to tag, otherwise the request will fail.

       

      .. note::

        

        The ``Valid Values`` lists all the resource types that can be tagged. However, the action you're using might not support tagging all of these resource types. If you try to tag a resource type that is unsupported for the action you're using, you'll get an error.

        

      

    
      - **ResourceType** *(string) --* 

        The type of resource to tag on creation.

        

      
      - **Tags** *(list) --* 

        The tags to apply to the resource.

        

      
        - *(dict) --* 

          Describes a tag.

          

        
          - **Key** *(string) --* 

            The key of the tag.

             

            Constraints: Tag keys are case-sensitive and accept a maximum of 127 Unicode characters. May not begin with ``aws:``.

            

          
          - **Value** *(string) --* 

            The value of the tag.

             

            Constraints: Tag values are case-sensitive and accept a maximum of 256 Unicode characters.

            

          
        
    
    

  :type DryRun: boolean
  :param DryRun: 

    Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is ``DryRunOperation``. Otherwise, it is ``UnauthorizedOperation``.

    

  
  :type OutpostArn: string
  :param OutpostArn: 

    .. note::

      

      Not supported for future-dated Capacity Reservations.

        - **EndDateType** *(string) --* 

          Indicates the way in which the Capacity Reservation ends. A Capacity Reservation can have one of the following end types:

           

          
          * ``unlimited`` - The Capacity Reservation remains active until you explicitly cancel it.
           
          * ``limited`` - The Capacity Reservation expires automatically at a specified date and time.

          * ``targeted`` - The Capacity Reservation only accepts instances that have matching attributes (instance type, platform, and Availability Zone), and explicitly target the Capacity Reservation. This ensures that only permitted instances can use the reserved capacity.
