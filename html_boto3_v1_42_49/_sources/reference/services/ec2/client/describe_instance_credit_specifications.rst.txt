.. py:method:: EC2.Client.describe_instance_credit_specifications(**kwargs)

  

  Describes the credit option for CPU usage of the specified burstable performance instances. The credit options are ``standard`` and ``unlimited``.

   

  If you do not specify an instance ID, Amazon EC2 returns burstable performance instances with the ``unlimited`` credit option, as well as instances that were previously configured as T2, T3, and T3a with the ``unlimited`` credit option. For example, if you resize a T2 instance, while it is configured as ``unlimited``, to an M4 instance, Amazon EC2 returns the M4 instance.

   

  If you specify one or more instance IDs, Amazon EC2 returns the credit option ( ``standard`` or ``unlimited``) of those instances. If you specify an instance ID that is not valid, such as an instance that is not a burstable performance instance, an error is returned.

   

  Recently terminated instances might appear in the returned results. This interval is usually less than one hour.

   

  If an Availability Zone is experiencing a service disruption and you specify instance IDs in the affected zone, or do not specify any instance IDs at all, the call fails. If you specify only instance IDs in an unaffected zone, the call works normally.

   

  For more information, see `Burstable performance instances <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/burstable-performance-instances.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.describe_instance_credit_specifications(
        DryRun=True|False,
        Filters=[
            {
                'Name': 'string',
                'Values': [
                    'string',
                ]
            },
        ],
        InstanceIds=[
            'string',
        ],
        MaxResults=123,
        NextToken='string'
    )
    
  :type DryRun: boolean
  :param DryRun: 

    Checks whether you have the required permissions for the operation, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is ``DryRunOperation``. Otherwise, it is ``UnauthorizedOperation``.

    

  
  :type Filters: list
  :param Filters: 

    The filters.

     

    
    * ``instance-id`` - The ID of the instance.
    

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more specific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be used to match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as tags, attributes, or IDs.

       

      If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an ``AND``, and the request returns only results that match all of the specified filters.

       

      For more information, see `List and filter using the CLI and API <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Filtering.html#Filtering_Resources_CLI>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

      

    
      - **Name** *(string) --* 

        The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

        

      
      - **Values** *(list) --* 

        The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you specify multiple values for a filter, the values are joined with an ``OR``, and the request returns all results that match any of the specified values.

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
    
    

  :type InstanceIds: list
  :param InstanceIds: 

    The instance IDs.

     

    Default: Describes all your instances.

     

    Constraints: Maximum 1000 explicitly specified instance IDs.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    The maximum number of items to return for this request. To get the next page of items, make another request with the token returned in the output. For more information, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Query-Requests.html#api-pagination>`__.

     

    You cannot specify this parameter and the instance IDs parameter in the same call.

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    The token returned from a previous paginated request. Pagination continues from the end of the items returned by the previous request.
