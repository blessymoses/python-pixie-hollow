.. py:method:: EC2.Client.describe_vpc_block_public_access_exclusions(**kwargs)

  

  Describe VPC Block Public Access (BPA) exclusions. A VPC BPA exclusion is a mode that can be applied to a single VPC or subnet that exempts it from the account’s BPA mode and will allow bidirectional or egress-only access. You can create BPA exclusions for VPCs and subnets even when BPA is not enabled on the account to ensure that there is no traffic disruption to the exclusions when VPC BPA is turned on. To learn more about VPC BPA, see `Block public access to VPCs and subnets <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/security-vpc-bpa.html>`__ in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.describe_vpc_block_public_access_exclusions(
        DryRun=True|False,
        Filters=[
            {
                'Name': 'string',
                'Values': [
                    'string',
                ]
            },
        ],
        ExclusionIds=[
            'string',
        ],
        NextToken='string',
        MaxResults=123
    )
    
  :type DryRun: boolean
  :param DryRun: 

    Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is ``DryRunOperation``. Otherwise, it is ``UnauthorizedOperation``.

    

  
  :type Filters: list
  :param Filters: 

    Filters for the request:

     

    
    * ``resource-arn`` - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a exclusion.
     
    * ``internet-gateway-exclusion-mode`` - The mode of a VPC BPA exclusion. Possible values: ``allow-bidirectional | allow-egress``.
     
    * ``state`` - The state of VPC BPA. Possible values: ``create-in-progress | create-complete | update-in-progress | update-complete | delete-in-progress | deleted-complete | disable-in-progress | disable-complete``
     
    * ``tag`` - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key ``Owner`` and the value ``TeamA``, specify ``tag:Owner`` for the filter name and ``TeamA`` for the filter value.
     
    * ``tag-key`` - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, regardless of the tag value.
     
    * ``tag-value``: The value of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific value, regardless of the tag key.
    

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more specific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be used to match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as tags, attributes, or IDs.

       

      If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an ``AND``, and the request returns only results that match all of the specified filters.

       

      For more information, see `List and filter using the CLI and API <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Filtering.html#Filtering_Resources_CLI>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

      

    
      - **Name** *(string) --* 

        The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

        

      
      - **Values** *(list) --* 

        The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you specify multiple values for a filter, the values are joined with an ``OR``, and the request returns all results that match any of the specified values.

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
    
    

  :type ExclusionIds: list
  :param ExclusionIds: 

    IDs of exclusions.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    The token returned from a previous paginated request. Pagination continues from the end of the items returned by the previous request.

    

  
  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    The maximum number of items to return for this request. To get the next page of items, make another request with the token returned in the output. For more information, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Query-Requests.html#api-pagination>`__.
