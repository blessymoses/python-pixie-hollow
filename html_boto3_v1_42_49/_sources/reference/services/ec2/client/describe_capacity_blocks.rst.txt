  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    The token to use to retrieve the next page of results.

    

  
  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    The maximum number of items to return for this request. To get the next page of items, make another request with the token returned in the output. For more information, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Query-Requests.html#api-pagination>`__.

    

  
  :type Filters: list
  :param Filters: 

    One or more filters.

     

    
    * ``capacity-block-id`` - The ID of the Capacity Block.
     
    * ``ultraserver-type`` - The Capacity Block type. The type can be ``instances`` or ``ultraservers``.
     
    * ``availability-zone`` - The Availability Zone of the Capacity Block.
     
    * ``start-date`` - The date and time at which the Capacity Block was started.

    * ``state`` - The state of the Capacity Block ( ``active`` | ``expired`` | ``unavailable`` | ``cancelled`` | ``failed`` | ``scheduled`` | ``payment-pending`` | ``payment-failed``).
     
    * ``tags`` - The tags assigned to the Capacity Block.
    

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more specific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be used to match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as tags, attributes, or IDs.

       

      If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an ``AND``, and the request returns only results that match all of the specified filters.

       

      For more information, see `List and filter using the CLI and API <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Filtering.html#Filtering_Resources_CLI>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

      

    
      - **Name** *(string) --* 

        The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

        

      
      - **Values** *(list) --* 

        The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you specify multiple values for a filter, the values are joined with an ``OR``, and the request returns all results that match any of the specified values.

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
    
    

  :type DryRun: boolean
  :param DryRun: 

    Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is ``DryRunOperation``. Otherwise, it is ``UnauthorizedOperation``.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **CapacityBlocks** *(list) --* 

        The Capacity Blocks.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          Reserve powerful GPU instances on a future date to support your short duration machine learning (ML) workloads. Instances that run inside a Capacity Block are automatically placed close together inside `Amazon EC2 UltraClusters <http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/ultraclusters/>`__, for low-latency, petabit-scale, non-blocking networking.

           

          You can also reserve Amazon EC2 UltraServers. UltraServers connect multiple EC2 instances using a low-latency, high-bandwidth accelerator interconnect (NeuronLink). They are built to tackle very large-scale AI/ML workloads that require significant processing power. For more information, see Amazon EC2 UltraServers.

          
          

          - **CapacityBlockId** *(string) --*
