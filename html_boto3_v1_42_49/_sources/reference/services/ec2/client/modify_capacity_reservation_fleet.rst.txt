.. py:method:: EC2.Client.modify_capacity_reservation_fleet(**kwargs)

  

  Modifies a Capacity Reservation Fleet.

   

  When you modify the total target capacity of a Capacity Reservation Fleet, the Fleet automatically creates new Capacity Reservations, or modifies or cancels existing Capacity Reservations in the Fleet to meet the new total target capacity. When you modify the end date for the Fleet, the end dates for all of the individual Capacity Reservations in the Fleet are updated accordingly.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.modify_capacity_reservation_fleet(
        CapacityReservationFleetId='string',
        TotalTargetCapacity=123,
        EndDate=datetime(2015, 1, 1),
        DryRun=True|False,
        RemoveEndDate=True|False
    )
    
  :type CapacityReservationFleetId: string
  :param CapacityReservationFleetId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ID of the Capacity Reservation Fleet to modify.

    

  
  :type TotalTargetCapacity: integer
  :param TotalTargetCapacity: 

    The total number of capacity units to be reserved by the Capacity Reservation Fleet. This value, together with the instance type weights that you assign to each instance type used by the Fleet determine the number of instances for which the Fleet reserves capacity. Both values are based on units that make sense for your workload. For more information, see `Total target capacity <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/crfleet-concepts.html#target-capacity>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

    

  
  :type EndDate: datetime
  :param EndDate: 

    The date and time at which the Capacity Reservation Fleet expires. When the Capacity Reservation Fleet expires, its state changes to ``expired`` and all of the Capacity Reservations in the Fleet expire.

     

    The Capacity Reservation Fleet expires within an hour after the specified time. For example, if you specify ``5/31/2019``, ``13:30:55``, the Capacity Reservation Fleet is guaranteed to expire between ``13:30:55`` and ``14:30:55`` on ``5/31/2019``.

     

    You can't specify **EndDate** and **RemoveEndDate** in the same request.

    

  
  :type DryRun: boolean
  :param DryRun: 

    Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is ``DryRunOperation``. Otherwise, it is ``UnauthorizedOperation``.

    

  
  :type RemoveEndDate: boolean
  :param RemoveEndDate: 

    Indicates whether to remove the end date from the Capacity Reservation Fleet. If you remove the end date, the Capacity Reservation Fleet does not expire and it remains active until you explicitly cancel it using the **CancelCapacityReservationFleet** action.

     

    You can't specify **RemoveEndDate** and **EndDate** in the same request.
