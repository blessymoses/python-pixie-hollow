.. py:method:: EC2.Client.release_ipam_pool_allocation(**kwargs)

  

  Release an allocation within an IPAM pool. The Region you use should be the IPAM pool locale. The locale is the Amazon Web Services Region where this IPAM pool is available for allocations. You can only use this action to release manual allocations. To remove an allocation for a resource without deleting the resource, set its monitored state to false using `ModifyIpamResourceCidr <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_ModifyIpamResourceCidr.html>`__. For more information, see `Release an allocation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/ipam/release-alloc-ipam.html>`__ in the *Amazon VPC IPAM User Guide*.

   

  .. note::

    

    All EC2 API actions follow an `eventual consistency <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/devguide/eventual-consistency.html>`__ model.
