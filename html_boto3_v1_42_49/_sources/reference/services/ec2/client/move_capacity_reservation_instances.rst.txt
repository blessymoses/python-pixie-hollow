.. py:method:: EC2.Client.move_capacity_reservation_instances(**kwargs)

  

  Move available capacity from a source Capacity Reservation to a destination Capacity Reservation. The source Capacity Reservation and the destination Capacity Reservation must be ``active``, owned by your Amazon Web Services account, and share the following:

   

  
  * Instance type
   
  * Platform
   
  * Availability Zone
   
  * Tenancy
   
  * Placement group
   
  * Capacity Reservation end time - ``At specific time`` or ``Manually``.
