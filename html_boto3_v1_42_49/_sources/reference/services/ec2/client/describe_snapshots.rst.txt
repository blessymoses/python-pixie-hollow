.. py:method:: EC2.Client.describe_snapshots(**kwargs)

  

  Describes the specified EBS snapshots available to you or all of the EBS snapshots available to you.

   

  The snapshots available to you include public snapshots, private snapshots that you own, and private snapshots owned by other Amazon Web Services accounts for which you have explicit create volume permissions.

   

  The create volume permissions fall into the following categories:

   

  
  * *public*: The owner of the snapshot granted create volume permissions for the snapshot to the ``all`` group. All Amazon Web Services accounts have create volume permissions for these snapshots.
   
  * *explicit*: The owner of the snapshot granted create volume permissions to a specific Amazon Web Services account.
   
  * *implicit*: An Amazon Web Services account has implicit create volume permissions for all snapshots it owns.
  

   

  The list of snapshots returned can be filtered by specifying snapshot IDs, snapshot owners, or Amazon Web Services accounts with create volume permissions. If no options are specified, Amazon EC2 returns all snapshots for which you have create volume permissions.

   

  If you specify one or more snapshot IDs, only snapshots that have the specified IDs are returned. If you specify an invalid snapshot ID, an error is returned. If you specify a snapshot ID for which you do not have access, it is not included in the returned results.

   

  If you specify one or more snapshot owners using the ``OwnerIds`` option, only snapshots from the specified owners and for which you have access are returned. The results can include the Amazon Web Services account IDs of the specified owners, ``amazon`` for snapshots owned by Amazon, or ``self`` for snapshots that you own.

   

  If you specify a list of restorable users, only snapshots with create snapshot permissions for those users are returned. You can specify Amazon Web Services account IDs (if you own the snapshots), ``self`` for snapshots for which you own or have explicit permissions, or ``all`` for public snapshots.

   

  If you are describing a long list of snapshots, we recommend that you paginate the output to make the list more manageable. For more information, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Query-Requests.html#api-pagination>`__.

   

  For more information about EBS snapshots, see `Amazon EBS snapshots <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-snapshots.html>`__ in the *Amazon EBS User Guide*.

   

  .. warning::

     

    We strongly recommend using only paginated requests. Unpaginated requests are susceptible to throttling and timeouts.

            },
        ]
    )
    
  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    The maximum number of items to return for this request. To get the next page of items, make another request with the token returned in the output. For more information, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Query-Requests.html#api-pagination>`__.

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    The token returned from a previous paginated request. Pagination continues from the end of the items returned by the previous request.

    

  
  :type OwnerIds: list
  :param OwnerIds: 

    Scopes the results to snapshots with the specified owners. You can specify a combination of Amazon Web Services account IDs, ``self``, and ``amazon``.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type RestorableByUserIds: list
  :param RestorableByUserIds: 

    The IDs of the Amazon Web Services accounts that can create volumes from the snapshot.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type SnapshotIds: list
  :param SnapshotIds: 

    The snapshot IDs.

     

    Default: Describes the snapshots for which you have create volume permissions.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type DryRun: boolean
  :param DryRun: 

    Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is ``DryRunOperation``. Otherwise, it is ``UnauthorizedOperation``.

    

  
  :type Filters: list
  :param Filters: 

    The filters.

     

    
    * ``description`` - A description of the snapshot.
     
    * ``encrypted`` - Indicates whether the snapshot is encrypted ( ``true`` | ``false``)
     
    * ``owner-alias`` - The owner alias, from an Amazon-maintained list ( ``amazon``). This is not the user-configured Amazon Web Services account alias set using the IAM console. We recommend that you use the related parameter instead of this filter.
     
    * ``owner-id`` - The Amazon Web Services account ID of the owner. We recommend that you use the related parameter instead of this filter.
     
    * ``progress`` - The progress of the snapshot, as a percentage (for example, 80%).
     
    * ``snapshot-id`` - The snapshot ID.
     
    * ``start-time`` - The time stamp when the snapshot was initiated.
     
    * ``status`` - The status of the snapshot ( ``pending`` | ``completed`` | ``error``).
     
    * ``storage-tier`` - The storage tier of the snapshot ( ``archive`` | ``standard``).
     
    * ``transfer-type`` - The type of operation used to create the snapshot ( ``time-based`` | ``standard``).
     
    * ``tag``:<key> - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key ``Owner`` and the value ``TeamA``, specify ``tag:Owner`` for the filter name and ``TeamA`` for the filter value.
     
    * ``tag-key`` - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, regardless of the tag value.
     
    * ``volume-id`` - The ID of the volume the snapshot is for.
     
    * ``volume-size`` - The size of the volume, in GiB.
    

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more specific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be used to match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as tags, attributes, or IDs.

       

      If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an ``AND``, and the request returns only results that match all of the specified filters.

       

      For more information, see `List and filter using the CLI and API <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Filtering.html#Filtering_Resources_CLI>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

      

    
      - **Name** *(string) --* 

        The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

        

      
      - **Values** *(list) --* 

        The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you specify multiple values for a filter, the values are joined with an ``OR``, and the request returns all results that match any of the specified values.

          - **TransferType** *(string) --* 

            .. note::

              

              Only for snapshot copies.

              

             

            Indicates whether the snapshot copy was created with a standard or time-based snapshot copy operation. Time-based snapshot copy operations complete within the completion duration specified in the request. Standard snapshot copy operations are completed on a best-effort basis.

             

            
            * ``standard`` - The snapshot copy was created with a standard snapshot copy operation.
             
            * ``time-based`` - The snapshot copy was created with a time-based snapshot copy operation.
            

            
          

          - **CompletionDurationMinutes** *(integer) --* 

            .. note::

              

              Only for snapshot copies created with time-based snapshot copy operations.

              

             

            The completion duration requested for the time-based snapshot copy operation.

            
          

          - **CompletionTime** *(datetime) --* 

            The time stamp when the snapshot was completed.

            
          

          - **FullSnapshotSizeInBytes** *(integer) --* 

            The full size of the snapshot, in bytes.

             

            .. warning::

               

              This is **not** the incremental size of the snapshot. This is the full snapshot size and represents the size of all the blocks that were written to the source volume at the time the snapshot was created.

              

            
          

          - **SnapshotId** *(string) --* 

            The ID of the snapshot. Each snapshot receives a unique identifier when it is created.

            
          

          - **VolumeId** *(string) --* 

            The ID of the volume that was used to create the snapshot. Snapshots created by a copy snapshot operation have an arbitrary volume ID that you should not use for any purpose.

            
          

          - **State** *(string) --* 

            The snapshot state.

            
          

          - **StateMessage** *(string) --* 

            Encrypted Amazon EBS snapshots are copied asynchronously. If a snapshot copy operation fails (for example, if the proper KMS permissions are not obtained) this field displays error state details to help you diagnose why the error occurred. This parameter is only returned by  DescribeSnapshots.

            
          

          - **StartTime** *(datetime) --* 

            The time stamp when the snapshot was initiated.

            
          

          - **Progress** *(string) --* 

            The progress of the snapshot, as a percentage.

            
          

          - **OwnerId** *(string) --* 

            The ID of the Amazon Web Services account that owns the EBS snapshot.

            
          

          - **Description** *(string) --* 

            The description for the snapshot.

            
          

          - **VolumeSize** *(integer) --* 

            The size of the volume, in GiB.

            
          

          - **Encrypted** *(boolean) --* 

            Indicates whether the snapshot is encrypted.

            
          

          - **KmsKeyId** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the KMS key that was used to protect the volume encryption key for the parent volume.

            
          

          - **DataEncryptionKeyId** *(string) --* 

            The data encryption key identifier for the snapshot. This value is a unique identifier that corresponds to the data encryption key that was used to encrypt the original volume or snapshot copy. Because data encryption keys are inherited by volumes created from snapshots, and vice versa, if snapshots share the same data encryption key identifier, then they belong to the same volume/snapshot lineage. This parameter is only returned by  DescribeSnapshots.
