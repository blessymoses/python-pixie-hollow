.. py:method:: EC2.Client.send_diagnostic_interrupt(**kwargs)

  

  Sends a diagnostic interrupt to the specified Amazon EC2 instance to trigger a *kernel panic* (on Linux instances), or a *blue screen*/*stop error* (on Windows instances). For instances based on Intel and AMD processors, the interrupt is received as a *non-maskable interrupt* (NMI).

   

  In general, the operating system crashes and reboots when a kernel panic or stop error is triggered. The operating system can also be configured to perform diagnostic tasks, such as generating a memory dump file, loading a secondary kernel, or obtaining a call trace.

   

  Before sending a diagnostic interrupt to your instance, ensure that its operating system is configured to perform the required diagnostic tasks.

   

  For more information about configuring your operating system to generate a crash dump when a kernel panic or stop error occurs, see `Send a diagnostic interrupt (for advanced users) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/diagnostic-interrupt.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.send_diagnostic_interrupt(
        InstanceId='string',
        DryRun=True|False
    )
    
  :type InstanceId: string
  :param InstanceId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ID of the instance.

    

  
  :type DryRun: boolean
  :param DryRun: 

    Checks whether you have the required permissions for the operation, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is ``DryRunOperation``. Otherwise, it is ``UnauthorizedOperation``.
