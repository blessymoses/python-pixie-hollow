.. py:method:: EC2.Client.modify_ipam_resource_cidr(**kwargs)

  

  Modify a resource CIDR. You can use this action to transfer resource CIDRs between scopes and ignore resource CIDRs that you do not want to manage. If set to false, the resource will not be tracked for overlap, it cannot be auto-imported into a pool, and it will be removed from any pool it has an allocation in.

   

  For more information, see `Move resource CIDRs between scopes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/ipam/move-resource-ipam.html>`__ and `Change the monitoring state of resource CIDRs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/ipam/change-monitoring-state-ipam.html>`__ in the *Amazon VPC IPAM User Guide*.

    A check for whether you have the required permissions for the action without actually making the request and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is ``DryRunOperation``. Otherwise, it is ``UnauthorizedOperation``.

    

  
  :type ResourceId: string
  :param ResourceId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ID of the resource you want to modify.

    

  
  :type ResourceCidr: string
  :param ResourceCidr: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The CIDR of the resource you want to modify.

    

  
  :type ResourceRegion: string
  :param ResourceRegion: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The Amazon Web Services Region of the resource you want to modify.

    

  
  :type CurrentIpamScopeId: string
  :param CurrentIpamScopeId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ID of the current scope that the resource CIDR is in.

    

  
  :type DestinationIpamScopeId: string
  :param DestinationIpamScopeId: 

    The ID of the scope you want to transfer the resource CIDR to.

    

  
  :type Monitored: boolean
  :param Monitored: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Determines if the resource is monitored by IPAM. If a resource is monitored, the resource is discovered by IPAM and you can view details about the resource’s CIDR.

        - **ResourceCidr** *(string) --* 

          The CIDR for an IPAM resource.

          - *(dict) --* 

            The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key ``Owner`` and the value ``TeamA``, specify ``tag:Owner`` for the filter name and ``TeamA`` for the filter value.

            
            

            - **Key** *(string) --*

          The percentage of IP address space in use. To convert the decimal to a percentage, multiply the decimal by 100. Note the following:

           

          
          * For resources that are VPCs, this is the percentage of IP address space in the VPC that's taken up by subnet CIDRs.
           
          * For resources that are subnets, if the subnet has an IPv4 CIDR provisioned to it, this is the percentage of IPv4 address space in the subnet that's in use. If the subnet has an IPv6 CIDR provisioned to it, the percentage of IPv6 address space in use is not represented. The percentage of IPv6 address space in use cannot currently be calculated.
           
          * For resources that are public IPv4 pools, this is the percentage of IP address space in the pool that's been allocated to Elastic IP addresses (EIPs).
          

          
        

        - **ComplianceStatus** *(string) --* 

          The compliance status of the IPAM resource. For more information on compliance statuses, see `Monitor CIDR usage by resource <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/ipam/monitor-cidr-compliance-ipam.html>`__ in the *Amazon VPC IPAM User Guide*.

          
        

        - **ManagementState** *(string) --*

        - **OverlapStatus** *(string) --* 

          The overlap status of an IPAM resource. The overlap status tells you if the CIDR for a resource overlaps with another CIDR in the scope. For more information on overlap statuses, see `Monitor CIDR usage by resource <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/ipam/monitor-cidr-compliance-ipam.html>`__ in the *Amazon VPC IPAM User Guide*.
