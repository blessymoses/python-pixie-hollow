.. py:method:: EC2.Client.associate_security_group_vpc(**kwargs)

  

  Associates a security group with another VPC in the same Region. This enables you to use the same security group with network interfaces and instances in the specified VPC.

   

  .. note::

    

    
    * The VPC you want to associate the security group with must be in the same Region.
     
    * You can associate the security group with another VPC if your account owns the VPC or if the VPC was shared with you.
     
    * You must own the security group.
     
    * You cannot use this feature with default security groups.
     
    * You cannot use this feature with the default VPC.
