.. py:method:: EC2.Client.move_byoip_cidr_to_ipam(**kwargs)

  

  Move a BYOIPv4 CIDR to IPAM from a public IPv4 pool.

   

  If you already have a BYOIPv4 CIDR with Amazon Web Services, you can move the CIDR to IPAM from a public IPv4 pool. You cannot move an IPv6 CIDR to IPAM. If you are bringing a new IP address to Amazon Web Services for the first time, complete the steps in `Tutorial\: BYOIP address CIDRs to IPAM <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/ipam/tutorials-byoip-ipam.html>`__.

        DryRun=True|False,
        Cidr='string',

    The BYOIP CIDR.

    

  
  :type IpamPoolId: string
  :param IpamPoolId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The IPAM pool ID.

    

  
  :type IpamPoolOwner: string
  :param IpamPoolOwner: **[REQUIRED]**

          * ``failed-deprovision``: The request to deprovision the address range was unsuccessful. Ensure that all EIPs from the range have been deallocated and try again.

        - **NetworkBorderGroup** *(string) --* 

          If you have `Local Zones <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/local-zones/latest/ug/how-local-zones-work.html>`__ enabled, you can choose a network border group for Local Zones when you provision and advertise a BYOIPv4 CIDR. Choose the network border group carefully as the EIP and the Amazon Web Services resource it is associated with must reside in the same network border group.

           

          You can provision BYOIP address ranges to and advertise them in the following Local Zone network border groups:

           

          
          * us-east-1-dfw-2
           
          * us-west-2-lax-1
           
          * us-west-2-phx-2
          

           

          .. note::

            

            You cannot provision or advertise BYOIPv6 address ranges in Local Zones at this time.

            

          
        

        - **AdvertisementType** *(string) --* 

          Specifies the advertisement method for the BYOIP CIDR. Valid values are:

           

          
          * ``unicast``: IP is advertised from a single location (regional services like EC2)
           
          * ``anycast``: IP is advertised from multiple global locations simultaneously (global services like CloudFront)
          

           

          For more information, see `Bring your own IP to CloudFront using IPAM <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/ipam/tutorials-byoip-cloudfront.html>`__ in the *Amazon VPC IPAM User Guide*.
