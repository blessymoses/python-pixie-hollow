  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.describe_client_vpn_connections(
        ClientVpnEndpointId='string',
        Filters=[
            {
                'Name': 'string',
                'Values': [
                    'string',
                ]

        NextToken='string',
        MaxResults=123,
        DryRun=True|False
    )
    
  :type ClientVpnEndpointId: string
  :param ClientVpnEndpointId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ID of the Client VPN endpoint.

    

  
  :type Filters: list
  :param Filters: 

    One or more filters. Filter names and values are case-sensitive.

     

    
    * ``connection-id`` - The ID of the connection.
     
    * ``username`` - For Active Directory client authentication, the user name of the client who established the client connection.
    

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more specific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be used to match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as tags, attributes, or IDs.

       

      If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an ``AND``, and the request returns only results that match all of the specified filters.

       

      For more information, see `List and filter using the CLI and API <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Filtering.html#Filtering_Resources_CLI>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

      

    
      - **Name** *(string) --* 

        The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

        

      
      - **Values** *(list) --* 

        The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you specify multiple values for a filter, the values are joined with an ``OR``, and the request returns all results that match any of the specified values.

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
    
    

  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    The token to retrieve the next page of results.

    

  
  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    The maximum number of results to return for the request in a single page. The remaining results can be seen by sending another request with the nextToken value.

    

  
  :type DryRun: boolean
  :param DryRun: 

    Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is ``DryRunOperation``. Otherwise, it is ``UnauthorizedOperation``.
