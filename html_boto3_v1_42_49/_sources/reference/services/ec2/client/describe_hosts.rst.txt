.. py:method:: EC2.Client.describe_hosts(**kwargs)

  

  Describes the specified Dedicated Hosts or all your Dedicated Hosts.

   

  The results describe only the Dedicated Hosts in the Region you're currently using. All listed instances consume capacity on your Dedicated Host. Dedicated Hosts that have recently been released are listed with the state ``released``.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.describe_hosts(
        HostIds=[
            'string',
        ],
        NextToken='string',
        MaxResults=123,
        Filters=[
            {
                'Name': 'string',
                'Values': [
                    'string',
                ]
            },
        ]
    )
    
  :type HostIds: list
  :param HostIds: 

    The IDs of the Dedicated Hosts. The IDs are used for targeted instance launches.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    The token to use to retrieve the next page of results.

    

  
  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    The maximum number of results to return for the request in a single page. The remaining results can be seen by sending another request with the returned ``nextToken`` value. This value can be between 5 and 500. If ``maxResults`` is given a larger value than 500, you receive an error.

     

    You cannot specify this parameter and the host IDs parameter in the same request.

    

  
  :type Filters: list
  :param Filters: 

    The filters.

     

    
    * ``auto-placement`` - Whether auto-placement is enabled or disabled ( ``on`` | ``off``).
     
    * ``availability-zone`` - The Availability Zone of the host.
     
    * ``client-token`` - The idempotency token that you provided when you allocated the host.
     
    * ``host-reservation-id`` - The ID of the reservation assigned to this host.
     
    * ``instance-type`` - The instance type size that the Dedicated Host is configured to support.
     
    * ``state`` - The allocation state of the Dedicated Host ( ``available`` | ``under-assessment`` | ``permanent-failure`` | ``released`` | ``released-permanent-failure``).
     
    * ``tag-key`` - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, regardless of the tag value.
    

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more specific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be used to match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as tags, attributes, or IDs.

       

      If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an ``AND``, and the request returns only results that match all of the specified filters.

       

      For more information, see `List and filter using the CLI and API <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Filtering.html#Filtering_Resources_CLI>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

      

    
      - **Name** *(string) --* 

        The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

        

      
      - **Values** *(list) --* 

        The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you specify multiple values for a filter, the values are joined with an ``OR``, and the request returns all results that match any of the specified values.
