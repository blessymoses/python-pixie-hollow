.. py:method:: EC2.Client.enable_snapshot_block_public_access(**kwargs)

  

  Enables or modifies the *block public access for snapshots* setting at the account level for the specified Amazon Web Services Region. After you enable block public access for snapshots in a Region, users can no longer request public sharing for snapshots in that Region. Snapshots that are already publicly shared are either treated as private or they remain publicly shared, depending on the **State** that you specify.

   

  .. warning::

     

    Enabling block public access for snapshots in *block all sharing* mode does not change the permissions for snapshots that are already publicly shared. Instead, it prevents these snapshots from be publicly visible and publicly accessible. Therefore, the attributes for these snapshots still indicate that they are publicly shared, even though they are not publicly available.

     

    If you later disable block public access or change the mode to *block new sharing*, these snapshots will become publicly available again.

     

   

  For more information, see `Block public access for snapshots <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/block-public-access-snapshots.html>`__ in the *Amazon EBS User Guide*.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.enable_snapshot_block_public_access(
        State='block-all-sharing'|'block-new-sharing'|'unblocked',
        DryRun=True|False
    )
    
  :type State: string
  :param State: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The mode in which to enable block public access for snapshots for the Region. Specify one of the following values:

     

    
    * ``block-all-sharing`` - Prevents all public sharing of snapshots in the Region. Users in the account will no longer be able to request new public sharing. Additionally, snapshots that are already publicly shared are treated as private and they are no longer publicly available.
     
    * ``block-new-sharing`` - Prevents only new public sharing of snapshots in the Region. Users in the account will no longer be able to request new public sharing. However, snapshots that are already publicly shared, remain publicly available.
    

     

    ``unblocked`` is not a valid value for **EnableSnapshotBlockPublicAccess**.

    

  
  :type DryRun: boolean
  :param DryRun: 

    Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is ``DryRunOperation``. Otherwise, it is ``UnauthorizedOperation``.
