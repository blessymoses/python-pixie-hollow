.. py:attribute:: EC2.NetworkInterface.ipv6_addresses

  

  - *(list) --* 

    The IPv6 addresses associated with the network interface.

    
    

    - *(dict) --* 

      Describes an IPv6 address associated with a network interface.

      
      

      - **Ipv6Address** *(string) --* 

        The IPv6 address.

        
      

      - **PublicIpv6DnsName** *(string) --* 

        An IPv6-enabled public hostname for a network interface. Requests from within the VPC or from the internet resolve to the IPv6 GUA of the network interface. For more information, see `EC2 instance hostnames, DNS names, and domains <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-naming.html>`__ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

        
      

      - **IsPrimaryIpv6** *(boolean) --* 

        Determines if an IPv6 address associated with a network interface is the primary IPv6 address. When you enable an IPv6 GUA address to be a primary IPv6, the first IPv6 GUA will be made the primary IPv6 address until the instance is terminated or the network interface is detached. For more information, see `ModifyNetworkInterfaceAttribute <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_ModifyNetworkInterfaceAttribute.html>`__.
