.. py:attribute:: EC2.NetworkInterface.deny_all_igw_traffic

  

  - *(boolean) --* 

    Indicates whether a network interface with an IPv6 address is unreachable from the public internet. If the value is ``true``, inbound traffic from the internet is dropped and you cannot assign an elastic IP address to the network interface. The network interface is reachable from peered VPCs and resources connected through a transit gateway, including on-premises networks.
