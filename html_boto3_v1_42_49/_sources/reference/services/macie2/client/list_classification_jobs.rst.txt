    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 

      The request succeeded.

      
      

      - **items** *(list) --* 

        An array of objects, one for each job that matches the filter criteria specified in the request.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          Provides information about a classification job, including the current status of the job.

          
          

          - **bucketCriteria** *(dict) --* 

            The property- and tag-based conditions that determine which S3 buckets are included or excluded from the job's analysis. Each time the job runs, the job uses these criteria to determine which buckets to analyze. A job's definition can contain a bucketCriteria object or a bucketDefinitions array, not both.

            
            

            - **excludes** *(dict) --* 

              The property- and tag-based conditions that determine which buckets to exclude from the job.

              
              

              - **and** *(list) --* 

                An array of conditions, one for each condition that determines which buckets to include or exclude from the job. If you specify more than one condition, Amazon Macie uses AND logic to join the conditions.

                
                

                - *(dict) --*

            * USER_PAUSED - You paused the job. If you paused the job while it had a status of RUNNING and you don't resume it within 30 days of pausing it, the job or job run will expire and be cancelled, depending on the job's type.
