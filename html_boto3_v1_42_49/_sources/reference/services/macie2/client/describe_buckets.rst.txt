  :param criteria: 

    The criteria to use to filter the query results.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    
      - *(dict) --* 

        Specifies the operator to use in a property-based condition that filters the results of a query for information about S3 buckets.

        

      
        - **eq** *(list) --* 

          The value for the property matches (equals) the specified value. If you specify multiple values, Amazon Macie uses OR logic to join the values.

          

        
          - *(string) --* 

          
      
        - **gt** *(integer) --* 

          The value for the property is greater than the specified value.

          

        
        - **gte** *(integer) --* 

          The value for the property is greater than or equal to the specified value.

          

        
        - **lt** *(integer) --* 

          The value for the property is less than the specified value.

          

        
        - **lte** *(integer) --* 

          The value for the property is less than or equal to the specified value.

          

        
        - **neq** *(list) --* 

          The value for the property doesn't match (doesn't equal) the specified value. If you specify multiple values, Amazon Macie uses OR logic to join the values.

          

        
          - *(string) --* 

          
      
        - **prefix** *(string) --*

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 

      The request succeeded.

      
      

      - **buckets** *(list) --* 

        An array of objects, one for each bucket that matches the filter criteria specified in the request.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          Provides statistical data and other information about an S3 bucket that Amazon Macie monitors and analyzes for your account. By default, object count and storage size values include data for object parts that are the result of incomplete multipart uploads. For more information, see `How Macie monitors Amazon S3 data security <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/macie/latest/user/monitoring-s3-how-it-works.html>`__ in the *Amazon Macie User Guide*.

           

          If an error or issue prevents Macie from retrieving and processing metadata from Amazon S3 for the bucket or the bucket's objects, the value for the versioning property is false and the value for most other properties is null or UNKNOWN. Key exceptions are accountId, bucketArn, bucketCreatedAt, bucketName, lastUpdated, and region. To identify the cause, refer to the errorCode and errorMessage values.

          
          

          - **accountId** *(string) --* 

            The unique identifier for the Amazon Web Services account that owns the bucket.

            
          

          - **allowsUnencryptedObjectUploads** *(string) --* 

            Specifies whether the bucket policy for the bucket requires server-side encryption of objects when objects are added to the bucket. Possible values are:

             

            
            * FALSE - The bucket policy requires server-side encryption of new objects. PutObject requests must include a valid server-side encryption header.
             
            * TRUE - The bucket doesn't have a bucket policy or it has a bucket policy that doesn't require server-side encryption of new objects. If a bucket policy exists, it doesn't require PutObject requests to include a valid server-side encryption header.
             
            * UNKNOWN - Amazon Macie can't determine whether the bucket policy requires server-side encryption of new objects.
            

             

            Valid server-side encryption headers are: x-amz-server-side-encryption with a value of AES256 or aws:kms, and x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm with a value of AES256.

            
          

          - **automatedDiscoveryMonitoringStatus** *(string) --* 

            Specifies whether automated sensitive data discovery is currently configured to analyze objects in the bucket. Possible values are: MONITORED, the bucket is included in analyses; and, NOT_MONITORED, the bucket is excluded from analyses. If automated sensitive data discovery is disabled for your account, this value is NOT_MONITORED.

            
          

          - **bucketArn** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the bucket.

            
          

          - **bucketCreatedAt** *(datetime) --* 

            The date and time, in UTC and extended ISO 8601 format, when the bucket was created. This value can also indicate when changes such as edits to the bucket's policy were most recently made to the bucket.

            
          

          - **bucketName** *(string) --* 

            The name of the bucket.

            
          

          - **classifiableObjectCount** *(integer) --* 

            The total number of objects that Amazon Macie can analyze in the bucket. These objects use a supported storage class and have a file name extension for a supported file or storage format.

            
          

          - **classifiableSizeInBytes** *(integer) --* 

            The total storage size, in bytes, of the objects that Amazon Macie can analyze in the bucket. These objects use a supported storage class and have a file name extension for a supported file or storage format.

             

            If versioning is enabled for the bucket, Macie calculates this value based on the size of the latest version of each applicable object in the bucket. This value doesn't reflect the storage size of all versions of each applicable object in the bucket.

            
          

          - **errorCode** *(string) --* 

            The code for an error or issue that prevented Amazon Macie from retrieving and processing information about the bucket and the bucket's objects. Possible values are:

             

            
            * ACCESS_DENIED - Macie doesn't have permission to retrieve the information. For example, the bucket has a restrictive bucket policy and Amazon S3 denied the request.
             
            * BUCKET_COUNT_EXCEEDS_QUOTA - Retrieving and processing the information would exceed the quota for the number of buckets that Macie monitors for an account (10,000).
            

             

            If this value is null, Macie was able to retrieve and process the information.

            
          

          - **errorMessage** *(string) --* 

            A brief description of the error or issue (errorCode) that prevented Amazon Macie from retrieving and processing information about the bucket and the bucket's objects. This value is null if Macie was able to retrieve and process the information.

            
          

          - **jobDetails** *(dict) --* 

            Specifies whether any one-time or recurring classification jobs are configured to analyze objects in the bucket, and, if so, the details of the job that ran most recently.

            
            

            - **isDefinedInJob** *(string) --* 

              Specifies whether any one-time or recurring jobs are configured to analyze objects in the bucket. Possible values are:

               

              
              * TRUE - The bucket is explicitly included in the bucket definition (S3BucketDefinitionForJob) for one or more jobs and at least one of those jobs has a status other than CANCELLED. Or the bucket matched the bucket criteria (S3BucketCriteriaForJob) for at least one job that previously ran.
               
              * FALSE - The bucket isn't explicitly included in the bucket definition (S3BucketDefinitionForJob) for any jobs, all the jobs that explicitly include the bucket in their bucket definitions have a status of CANCELLED, or the bucket didn't match the bucket criteria (S3BucketCriteriaForJob) for any jobs that previously ran.
               
              * UNKNOWN - An exception occurred when Amazon Macie attempted to retrieve job data for the bucket.
              

              
            

            - **isMonitoredByJob** *(string) --* 

              Specifies whether any recurring jobs are configured to analyze objects in the bucket. Possible values are:

               

              
              * TRUE - The bucket is explicitly included in the bucket definition (S3BucketDefinitionForJob) for one or more recurring jobs or the bucket matches the bucket criteria (S3BucketCriteriaForJob) for one or more recurring jobs. At least one of those jobs has a status other than CANCELLED.
               
              * FALSE - The bucket isn't explicitly included in the bucket definition (S3BucketDefinitionForJob) for any recurring jobs, the bucket doesn't match the bucket criteria (S3BucketCriteriaForJob) for any recurring jobs, or all the recurring jobs that are configured to analyze data in the bucket have a status of CANCELLED.
               
              * UNKNOWN - An exception occurred when Amazon Macie attempted to retrieve job data for the bucket.
              

              
            

            - **lastJobId** *(string) --* 

              The unique identifier for the job that ran most recently and is configured to analyze objects in the bucket, either the latest run of a recurring job or the only run of a one-time job.

               

              This value is typically null if the value for the isDefinedInJob property is FALSE or UNKNOWN.

              
            

            - **lastJobRunTime** *(datetime) --* 

              The date and time, in UTC and extended ISO 8601 format, when the job (lastJobId) started. If the job is a recurring job, this value indicates when the most recent run started.

               

              This value is typically null if the value for the isDefinedInJob property is FALSE or UNKNOWN.

              
        
          

          - **lastAutomatedDiscoveryTime** *(datetime) --* 

            The date and time, in UTC and extended ISO 8601 format, when Amazon Macie most recently analyzed objects in the bucket while performing automated sensitive data discovery. This value is null if this analysis hasn't occurred.

            
          

          - **lastUpdated** *(datetime) --* 

            The date and time, in UTC and extended ISO 8601 format, when Amazon Macie most recently retrieved bucket or object metadata from Amazon S3 for the bucket.
