          }
      )
      
    :type PaginationConfig: dict
    :param PaginationConfig: 

      A dictionary that provides parameters to control pagination.

      

    
      - **MaxItems** *(integer) --* 

        The total number of items to return. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified in max-items then a ``NextToken`` will be provided in the output that you can use to resume pagination.

        

      
      - **PageSize** *(integer) --* 

        The size of each page.

        

      
      - **StartingToken** *(string) --* 

        A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previous response.

      **Response Structure**

      

      - *(dict) --* 
        

        - **webhooks** *(list) --* 

          The JSON detail returned for each webhook in the list output for the ListWebhooks call.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            The detail returned for each webhook after listing webhooks, such as the webhook URL, the webhook name, and the webhook ARN.

            
            

            - **definition** *(dict) --* 

              The detail returned for each webhook, such as the webhook authentication type and filter rules.

              
              

              - **name** *(string) --* 

                The name of the webhook.

                
              

              - **targetPipeline** *(string) --* 

                The name of the pipeline you want to connect to the webhook.

                
              

              - **targetAction** *(string) --* 

                The name of the action in a pipeline you want to connect to the webhook. The action must be from the source (first) stage of the pipeline.

                
              

              - **filters** *(list) --* 

                A list of rules applied to the body/payload sent in the POST request to a webhook URL. All defined rules must pass for the request to be accepted and the pipeline started.

                
                

                - *(dict) --* 

                  The event criteria that specify when a webhook notification is sent to your URL.

                  
                  

                  - **jsonPath** *(string) --* 

                    A JsonPath expression that is applied to the body/payload of the webhook. The value selected by the JsonPath expression must match the value specified in the ``MatchEquals`` field. Otherwise, the request is ignored. For more information, see `Java JsonPath implementation <https://github.com/json-path/JsonPath>`__ in GitHub.

                    
                  

                  - **matchEquals** *(string) --* 

                    The value selected by the ``JsonPath`` expression must match what is supplied in the ``MatchEquals`` field. Otherwise, the request is ignored. Properties from the target action configuration can be included as placeholders in this value by surrounding the action configuration key with curly brackets. For example, if the value supplied here is "refs/heads/{Branch}" and the target action has an action configuration property called "Branch" with a value of "main", the ``MatchEquals`` value is evaluated as "refs/heads/main". For a list of action configuration properties for built-in action types, see `Pipeline Structure Reference Action Requirements <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/reference-pipeline-structure.html#action-requirements>`__.

                    
              
            
              

              - **authentication** *(string) --* 

                Supported options are GITHUB_HMAC, IP, and UNAUTHENTICATED.

                 

                .. warning::

                   

                  When creating CodePipeline webhooks, do not use your own credentials or reuse the same secret token across multiple webhooks. For optimal security, generate a unique secret token for each webhook you create. The secret token is an arbitrary string that you provide, which GitHub uses to compute and sign the webhook payloads sent to CodePipeline, for protecting the integrity and authenticity of the webhook payloads. Using your own credentials or reusing the same token across multiple webhooks can lead to security vulnerabilities.

                   

                 

                .. note::

                  

                  If a secret token was provided, it will be redacted in the response.

                  

                 

                
                * For information about the authentication scheme implemented by GITHUB_HMAC, see `Securing your webhooks <https://developer.github.com/webhooks/securing/>`__ on the GitHub Developer website.
                 
                * IP rejects webhooks trigger requests unless they originate from an IP address in the IP range whitelisted in the authentication configuration.
                 
                * UNAUTHENTICATED accepts all webhook trigger requests regardless of origin.
                

                
              

              - **authenticationConfiguration** *(dict) --* 

                Properties that configure the authentication applied to incoming webhook trigger requests. The required properties depend on the authentication type. For GITHUB_HMAC, only the ``SecretToken ``property must be set. For IP, only the ``AllowedIPRange ``property must be set to a valid CIDR range. For UNAUTHENTICATED, no properties can be set.

                
                

                - **AllowedIPRange** *(string) --* 

                  The property used to configure acceptance of webhooks in an IP address range. For IP, only the ``AllowedIPRange`` property must be set. This property must be set to a valid CIDR range.

                  
                

                - **SecretToken** *(string) --* 

                  The property used to configure GitHub authentication. For GITHUB_HMAC, only the ``SecretToken`` property must be set.

            - **url** *(string) --* 

              A unique URL generated by CodePipeline. When a POST request is made to this URL, the defined pipeline is started as long as the body of the post request satisfies the defined authentication and filtering conditions. Deleting and re-creating a webhook makes the old URL invalid and generates a new one.

              
            

            - **errorMessage** *(string) --* 

              The text of the error message about the webhook.

              
            

            - **errorCode** *(string) --* 

              The number code of the error.

              
            

            - **lastTriggered** *(datetime) --* 

              The date and time a webhook was last successfully triggered, in timestamp format.

              
            

            - **arn** *(string) --* 

              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the webhook.

              
            

            - **tags** *(list) --* 

              Specifies the tags applied to the webhook.

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                A tag is a key-value pair that is used to manage the resource.

                
                

                - **key** *(string) --* 

                  The tag's key.

                  
                

                - **value** *(string) --*
