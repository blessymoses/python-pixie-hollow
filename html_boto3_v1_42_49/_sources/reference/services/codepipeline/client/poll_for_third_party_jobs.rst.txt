.. py:method:: CodePipeline.Client.poll_for_third_party_jobs(**kwargs)

  

  Determines whether there are any third party jobs for a job worker to act on. Used for partner actions only.

   

  .. warning::

     

    When this API is called, CodePipeline returns temporary credentials for the S3 bucket used to store artifacts for the pipeline, if the action requires access to that S3 bucket for input or output artifacts.

    - **category** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      A category defines what kind of action can be taken in the stage, and constrains the provider type for the action. Valid categories are limited to one of the following values.

       

      
      * Source
       
      * Build
       
      * Test
       
      * Deploy
       
      * Invoke
       
      * Approval
       
      * Compute
      

      

    
    - **owner** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The creator of the action being called. There are three valid values for the ``Owner`` field in the action category section within your pipeline structure: ``AWS``, ``ThirdParty``, and ``Custom``. For more information, see `Valid Action Types and Providers in CodePipeline <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/reference-pipeline-structure.html#actions-valid-providers>`__.

      

    
    - **provider** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The provider of the service being called by the action. Valid providers are determined by the action category. For example, an action in the Deploy category type might have a provider of CodeDeploy, which would be specified as ``CodeDeploy``.
