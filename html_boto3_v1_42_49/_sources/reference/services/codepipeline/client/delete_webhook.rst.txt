.. py:method:: CodePipeline.Client.delete_webhook(**kwargs)

  

  Deletes a previously created webhook by name. Deleting the webhook stops CodePipeline from starting a pipeline every time an external event occurs. The API returns successfully when trying to delete a webhook that is already deleted. If a deleted webhook is re-created by calling PutWebhook with the same name, it will have a different URL.
