.. py:method:: CodePipeline.Client.get_third_party_job_details(**kwargs)

  

  Requests the details of a job for a third party action. Used for partner actions only.

   

  .. warning::

     

    When this API is called, CodePipeline returns temporary credentials for the S3 bucket used to store artifacts for the pipeline, if the action requires access to that S3 bucket for input or output artifacts. This API also returns any secret values defined for the action.

            The encryption key used to encrypt and decrypt data in the artifact store for the pipeline, such as an Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (Amazon Web Services KMS) key. This is optional and might not be present.

            
            

            - **id** *(string) --*

              .. note::

                

                Aliases are recognized only in the account that created the KMS key. For cross-account actions, you can only use the key ID or key ARN to identify the key. Cross-account actions involve using the role from the other account (AccountB), so specifying the key ID will use the key from the other account (AccountB).

                

              
            

            - **type** *(string) --*

        - **nonce** *(string) --* 

          A system-generated random number that CodePipeline uses to ensure that the job is being worked on by only one job worker. Use this number in an  AcknowledgeThirdPartyJob request.
