  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_pipelines(
        nextToken='string',
        maxResults=123
    )
    
  :type nextToken: string
  :param nextToken: 

    An identifier that was returned from the previous list pipelines call. It can be used to return the next set of pipelines in the list.

    

  
  :type maxResults: integer
  :param maxResults: 

    The maximum number of pipelines to return in a single call. To retrieve the remaining pipelines, make another call with the returned nextToken value. The minimum value you can specify is 1. The maximum accepted value is 1000.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 

      Represents the output of a ``ListPipelines`` action.

      
      

      - **pipelines** *(list) --* 

        The list of pipelines.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          Returns a summary of a pipeline.

          
          

          - **name** *(string) --* 

            The name of the pipeline.

            
          

          - **version** *(integer) --* 

            The version number of the pipeline.

            
          

          - **pipelineType** *(string) --* 

            CodePipeline provides the following pipeline types, which differ in characteristics and price, so that you can tailor your pipeline features and cost to the needs of your applications.

             

            
            * V1 type pipelines have a JSON structure that contains standard pipeline, stage, and action-level parameters.
             
            * V2 type pipelines have the same structure as a V1 type, along with additional parameters for release safety and trigger configuration.
            

             

            .. warning::

               

              Including V2 parameters, such as triggers on Git tags, in the pipeline JSON when creating or updating a pipeline will result in the pipeline having the V2 type of pipeline and the associated costs.

          - **executionMode** *(string) --* 

            The method that the pipeline will use to handle multiple executions. The default mode is SUPERSEDED.

            
          

          - **created** *(datetime) --* 

            The date and time the pipeline was created, in timestamp format.

        If the amount of returned information is significantly large, an identifier is also returned. It can be used in a subsequent list pipelines call to return the next set of pipelines in the list.
