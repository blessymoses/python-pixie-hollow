  :type pipelineName: string
  :param pipelineName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of the pipeline for which you want to get execution summary information.

    

  
  :type filter: dict
  :param filter: 

    Input information used to filter rule execution history.

    

  
    - **pipelineExecutionId** *(string) --*

    - **latestInPipelineExecution** *(dict) --* 

      The field that specifies to filter on the latest execution in the pipeline.

       

      .. note::

        

        Filtering on the latest execution is available for executions run on or after February 08, 2024.

        

      

    
      - **pipelineExecutionId** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The execution ID for the latest execution in the pipeline.

        

      
      - **startTimeRange** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The start time to filter on for the latest execution in the pipeline. Valid options:

  :type maxResults: integer
  :param maxResults: 

    The maximum number of results to return in a single call. To retrieve the remaining results, make another call with the returned nextToken value. Pipeline history is limited to the most recent 12 months, based on pipeline execution start times. Default value is 100.

    

  
  :type nextToken: string
  :param nextToken: 

    The token that was returned from the previous ``ListRuleExecutions`` call, which can be used to return the next set of rule executions in the list.
