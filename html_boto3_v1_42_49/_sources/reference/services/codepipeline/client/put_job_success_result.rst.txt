    )
    
  :type jobId: string
  :param jobId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The unique system-generated ID of the job that succeeded. This is the same ID returned from ``PollForJobs``.

    

  
  :type currentRevision: dict
  :param currentRevision: 

    The ID of the current revision of the artifact successfully worked on by the job.

    

  
    - **revision** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The revision ID of the current version of an artifact.

      

    
    - **changeIdentifier** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The change identifier for the current revision.

      

    
    - **created** *(datetime) --* 

      The date and time when the most recent revision of the artifact was created, in timestamp format.

      

    
    - **revisionSummary** *(string) --* 

      The summary of the most recent revision of the artifact.

      

    
  
  :type continuationToken: string
  :param continuationToken: 

    A token generated by a job worker, such as a CodeDeploy deployment ID, that a successful job provides to identify a custom action in progress. Future jobs use this token to identify the running instance of the action. It can be reused to return more information about the progress of the custom action. When the action is complete, no continuation token should be supplied.

    

  
  :type executionDetails: dict
  :param executionDetails: 

    The execution details of the successful job, such as the actions taken by the job worker.

    

  
    - **summary** *(string) --* 

      The summary of the current status of the actions.

      

    
    - **externalExecutionId** *(string) --* 

      The system-generated unique ID of this action used to identify this job worker in any external systems, such as CodeDeploy.

      

    
    - **percentComplete** *(integer) --* 

      The percentage of work completed on the action, represented on a scale of 0 to 100 percent.

      

    
  
  :type outputVariables: dict
  :param outputVariables: 

    Key-value pairs produced as output by a job worker that can be made available to a downstream action configuration. ``outputVariables`` can be included only when there is no continuation token on the request.
