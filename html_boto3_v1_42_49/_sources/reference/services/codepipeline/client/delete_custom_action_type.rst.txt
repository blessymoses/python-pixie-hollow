.. py:method:: CodePipeline.Client.delete_custom_action_type(**kwargs)

  

  Marks a custom action as deleted. ``PollForJobs`` for the custom action fails after the action is marked for deletion. Used for custom actions only.

   

  .. warning::

     

    To re-create a custom action after it has been deleted you must use a string in the version field that has never been used before. This string can be an incremented version number, for example. To restore a deleted custom action, use a JSON file that is identical to the deleted action, including the original string in the version field.
