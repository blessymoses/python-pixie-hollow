.. py:method:: PI.Client.get_resource_metrics(**kwargs)

  

  Retrieve Performance Insights metrics for a set of data sources over a time period. You can provide specific dimension groups and dimensions, and provide filtering criteria for each group. You must specify an aggregate function for each metric.

   

  .. note::

    

    Each response element returns a maximum of 500 bytes. For larger elements, such as SQL statements, only the first 500 bytes are returned.

    response = client.get_resource_metrics(
        ServiceType='RDS'|'DOCDB',
        Identifier='string',
        MetricQueries=[

                }
            },
        ],
        StartTime=datetime(2015, 1, 1),
        EndTime=datetime(2015, 1, 1),

        PeriodAlignment='END_TIME'|'START_TIME'
    )
    
  :type ServiceType: string
  :param ServiceType: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The Amazon Web Services service for which Performance Insights returns metrics. Valid values are as follows:

     

    
    * ``RDS``
     
    * ``DOCDB``
    

    

  
  :type Identifier: string
  :param Identifier: **[REQUIRED]** 

    An immutable identifier for a data source that is unique for an Amazon Web Services Region. Performance Insights gathers metrics from this data source. In the console, the identifier is shown as *ResourceID*. When you call ``DescribeDBInstances``, the identifier is returned as ``DbiResourceId``.

     

    To use a DB instance as a data source, specify its ``DbiResourceId`` value. For example, specify ``db-ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTU1VW2X``.

    

  
  :type MetricQueries: list
  :param MetricQueries: **[REQUIRED]** 

    An array of one or more queries to perform. Each query must specify a Performance Insights metric and specify an aggregate function, and you can provide filtering criteria. You must append the aggregate function to the metric. For example, to find the average for the metric ``db.load`` you must use ``db.load.avg``. Valid values for aggregate functions include ``.avg``, ``.min``, ``.max``, and ``.sum``.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      A single query to be processed. You must provide the metric to query and append an aggregate function to the metric. For example, to find the average for the metric ``db.load`` you must use ``db.load.avg``. Valid values for aggregate functions include ``.avg``, ``.min``, ``.max``, and ``.sum``. If no other parameters are specified, Performance Insights returns all data points for the specified metric. Optionally, you can request that the data points be aggregated by dimension group ( ``GroupBy``), and return only those data points that match your criteria ( ``Filter``).

      

    
      - **Metric** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The name of a Performance Insights metric to be measured.

         

        Valid values for ``Metric`` are:

         

        
        * ``db.load.avg`` - A scaled representation of the number of active sessions for the database engine.
         
        * ``db.sampledload.avg`` - The raw number of active sessions for the database engine.
         
        * The counter metrics listed in `Performance Insights operating system counters <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_PerfInsights_Counters.html#USER_PerfInsights_Counters.OS>`__ in the *Amazon Aurora User Guide*.
         
        * The counter metrics listed in `Performance Insights operating system counters <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_PerfInsights_Counters.html#USER_PerfInsights_Counters.OS>`__ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*.
        

         

        If the number of active sessions is less than an internal Performance Insights threshold, ``db.load.avg`` and ``db.sampledload.avg`` are the same value. If the number of active sessions is greater than the internal threshold, Performance Insights samples the active sessions, with ``db.load.avg`` showing the scaled values, ``db.sampledload.avg`` showing the raw values, and ``db.sampledload.avg`` less than ``db.load.avg``. For most use cases, you can query ``db.load.avg`` only.

        

      
      - **GroupBy** *(dict) --* 

        A specification for how to aggregate the data points from a query result. You must specify a valid dimension group. Performance Insights will return all of the dimensions within that group, unless you provide the names of specific dimensions within that group. You can also request that Performance Insights return a limited number of values for a dimension.

        

      
        - **Group** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The name of the dimension group. Valid values are as follows:

        - **Dimensions** *(list) --* 

          A list of specific dimensions from a dimension group. If this parameter is not present, then it signifies that all of the dimensions in the group were requested, or are present in the response.

           

          Valid values for elements in the ``Dimensions`` array are:

           

          
          * ``db.application.name`` - The name of the application that is connected to the database. Valid values are as follows:

        - *(string) --* A generic string type that forbids characters that could expose our service (or services downstream) to security risks around injections.

        
          - *(string) --* 

          
    
  
    

  :type StartTime: datetime
  :param StartTime: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The date and time specifying the beginning of the requested time series query range. You can't specify a ``StartTime`` that is earlier than 7 days ago. By default, Performance Insights has 7 days of retention, but you can extend this range up to 2 years. The value specified is *inclusive*. Thus, the command returns data points equal to or greater than ``StartTime``.

     

    The value for ``StartTime`` must be earlier than the value for ``EndTime``.

    

  
  :type EndTime: datetime
  :param EndTime: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The date and time specifying the end of the requested time series query range. The value specified is *exclusive*. Thus, the command returns data points less than (but not equal to) ``EndTime``.

     

    The value for ``EndTime`` must be later than the value for ``StartTime``.

    

  
  :type PeriodInSeconds: integer
  :param PeriodInSeconds: 

    The granularity, in seconds, of the data points returned from Performance Insights. A period can be as short as one second, or as long as one day (86400 seconds). Valid values are:

     

    
    * ``1`` (one second)
     
    * ``60`` (one minute)
     
    * ``300`` (five minutes)
     
    * ``3600`` (one hour)
     
    * ``86400`` (twenty-four hours)
    

     

    If you don't specify ``PeriodInSeconds``, then Performance Insights will choose a value for you, with a goal of returning roughly 100-200 data points in the response.

    

  
  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    The maximum number of items to return in the response.

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    An optional pagination token provided by a previous request. If this parameter is specified, the response includes only records beyond the token, up to the value specified by ``MaxRecords``.

    

  
  :type PeriodAlignment: string
  :param PeriodAlignment: 

    The returned timestamp which is the start or end time of the time periods. The default value is ``END_TIME``.

              If the number of active sessions is less than an internal Performance Insights threshold, ``db.load.avg`` and ``db.sampledload.avg`` are the same value. If the number of active sessions is greater than the internal threshold, Performance Insights samples the active sessions, with ``db.load.avg`` showing the scaled values, ``db.sampledload.avg`` showing the raw values, and ``db.sampledload.avg`` less than ``db.load.avg``. For most use cases, you can query ``db.load.avg`` only.

              
            

            - **Dimensions** *(dict) --* 

              The valid dimensions for the metric.
