.. py:method:: PI.Client.describe_dimension_keys(**kwargs)

  

  For a specific time period, retrieve the top ``N`` dimension keys for a metric.

   

  .. note::

    

    Each response element returns a maximum of 500 bytes. For larger elements, such as SQL statements, only the first 500 bytes are returned.

  :type ServiceType: string
  :param ServiceType: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The Amazon Web Services service for which Performance Insights will return metrics. Valid values are as follows:

     

    
    * ``RDS``
     
    * ``DOCDB``
    

    

  
  :type Identifier: string
  :param Identifier: **[REQUIRED]** 

    An immutable, Amazon Web Services Region-unique identifier for a data source. Performance Insights gathers metrics from this data source.

     

    To use an Amazon RDS instance as a data source, you specify its ``DbiResourceId`` value. For example, specify ``db-FAIHNTYBKTGAUSUZQYPDS2GW4A``.

    

  
  :type StartTime: datetime
  :param StartTime: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The date and time specifying the beginning of the requested time series data. You must specify a ``StartTime`` within the past 7 days. The value specified is *inclusive*, which means that data points equal to or greater than ``StartTime`` are returned.

     

    The value for ``StartTime`` must be earlier than the value for ``EndTime``.

    

  
  :type EndTime: datetime
  :param EndTime: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The date and time specifying the end of the requested time series data. The value specified is *exclusive*, which means that data points less than (but not equal to) ``EndTime`` are returned.

     

    The value for ``EndTime`` must be later than the value for ``StartTime``.

    

  
  :type Metric: string
  :param Metric: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of a Performance Insights metric to be measured.

     

    Valid values for ``Metric`` are:

     

    
    * ``db.load.avg`` - A scaled representation of the number of active sessions for the database engine.
     
    * ``db.sampledload.avg`` - The raw number of active sessions for the database engine.
    

     

    If the number of active sessions is less than an internal Performance Insights threshold, ``db.load.avg`` and ``db.sampledload.avg`` are the same value. If the number of active sessions is greater than the internal threshold, Performance Insights samples the active sessions, with ``db.load.avg`` showing the scaled values, ``db.sampledload.avg`` showing the raw values, and ``db.sampledload.avg`` less than ``db.load.avg``. For most use cases, you can query ``db.load.avg`` only.

    

  
  :type PeriodInSeconds: integer
  :param PeriodInSeconds: 

    The granularity, in seconds, of the data points returned from Performance Insights. A period can be as short as one second, or as long as one day (86400 seconds). Valid values are:

     

    
    * ``1`` (one second)
     
    * ``60`` (one minute)
     
    * ``300`` (five minutes)
     
    * ``3600`` (one hour)
     
    * ``86400`` (twenty-four hours)
    

     

    If you don't specify ``PeriodInSeconds``, then Performance Insights chooses a value for you, with a goal of returning roughly 100-200 data points in the response.

    

  
  :type GroupBy: dict
  :param GroupBy: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A specification for how to aggregate the data points from a query result. You must specify a valid dimension group. Performance Insights returns all dimensions within this group, unless you provide the names of specific dimensions within this group. You can also request that Performance Insights return a limited number of values for a dimension.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **AlignedStartTime** *(datetime) --* 

        The start time for the returned dimension keys, after alignment to a granular boundary (as specified by ``PeriodInSeconds``). ``AlignedStartTime`` will be less than or equal to the value of the user-specified ``StartTime``.

        
      

      - **AlignedEndTime** *(datetime) --* 

        The end time for the returned dimension keys, after alignment to a granular boundary (as specified by ``PeriodInSeconds``). ``AlignedEndTime`` will be greater than or equal to the value of the user-specified ``Endtime``.

        
      

      - **PartitionKeys** *(list) --* 

        If ``PartitionBy`` was present in the request, ``PartitionKeys`` contains the breakdown of dimension keys by the specified partitions.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          If ``PartitionBy`` was specified in a ``DescribeDimensionKeys`` request, the dimensions are returned in an array. Each element in the array specifies one dimension.

          
          

          - **Dimensions** *(dict) --* 

            A dimension map that contains the dimensions for this partition.

            
            

            - *(string) --* 
              

              - *(string) --* 
        
      
      
    
      

      - **Keys** *(list) --* 

        The dimension keys that were requested.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          An object that includes the requested dimension key values and aggregated metric values within a dimension group.

          
          

          - **Dimensions** *(dict) --* 

            A map of name-value pairs for the dimensions in the group.

            
            

            - *(string) --* 
              

              - *(string) --* 
        
      
          

          - **Total** *(float) --* 

            The aggregated metric value for the dimensions, over the requested time range.

            
          

          - **AdditionalMetrics** *(dict) --* 

            A map that contains the value for each additional metric.

            
            

            - *(string) --* 
              

              - *(float) --* 
        
      
          

          - **Partitions** *(list) --* 

            If ``PartitionBy`` was specified, ``PartitionKeys`` contains the dimensions that were.

            
            

            - *(float) --* 
        
      
    
      

      - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

        A pagination token that indicates the response didn’t return all available records because ``MaxRecords`` was specified in the previous request. To get the remaining records, specify ``NextToken`` in a separate request with this value.
