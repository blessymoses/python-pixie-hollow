.. py:method:: DeadlineCloud.Client.get_paginator(operation_name)

    
  Create a paginator for an operation.
  
  :type operation_name: string
  :param operation_name: The operation name.  This is the same name
      as the method name on the client.  For example, if the
      method name is ``create_foo``, and you'd normally invoke the
      operation as ``client.create_foo(**kwargs)``, if the
      ``create_foo`` operation can be paginated, you can use the
      call ``client.get_paginator("create_foo")``.
  
  :raise OperationNotPageableError: Raised if the operation is not
      pageable.  You can use the ``client.can_paginate`` method to
      check if an operation is pageable.
  
  :rtype: ``botocore.paginate.Paginator``
  :return: A paginator object.
