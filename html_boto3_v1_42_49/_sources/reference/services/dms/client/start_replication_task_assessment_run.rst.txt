.. py:method:: DatabaseMigrationService.Client.start_replication_task_assessment_run(**kwargs)

  

  Starts a new premigration assessment run for one or more individual assessments of a migration task.

   

  The assessments that you can specify depend on the source and target database engine and the migration type defined for the given task. To run this operation, your migration task must already be created. After you run this operation, you can review the status of each individual assessment. You can also run the migration task manually after the assessment run and its individual assessments complete.

    )
    
  :type ReplicationTaskArn: string
  :param ReplicationTaskArn: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the migration task associated with the premigration assessment run that you want to start.

    

  
  :type ServiceAccessRoleArn: string
  :param ServiceAccessRoleArn: **[REQUIRED]** 

    ARN of the service role needed to start the assessment run. The role must allow the ``iam:PassRole`` action.

    

  
  :type ResultLocationBucket: string
  :param ResultLocationBucket: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Amazon S3 bucket where you want DMS to store the results of this assessment run.

    

  
  :type ResultLocationFolder: string
  :param ResultLocationFolder: 

    Folder within an Amazon S3 bucket where you want DMS to store the results of this assessment run.

    

  
  :type ResultEncryptionMode: string
  :param ResultEncryptionMode: 

    Encryption mode that you can specify to encrypt the results of this assessment run. If you don't specify this request parameter, DMS stores the assessment run results without encryption. You can specify one of the options following:

     

    
    * ``"SSE_S3"`` – The server-side encryption provided as a default by Amazon S3.
     
    * ``"SSE_KMS"`` – Key Management Service (KMS) encryption. This encryption can use either a custom KMS encryption key that you specify or the default KMS encryption key that DMS provides.
    

    

  
  :type ResultKmsKeyArn: string
  :param ResultKmsKeyArn: 

    ARN of a custom KMS encryption key that you specify when you set ``ResultEncryptionMode`` to ``"SSE_KMS``".

    Unique name to identify the assessment run.

    

  
  :type IncludeOnly: list
  :param IncludeOnly: 

    Space-separated list of names for specific individual assessments that you want to include. These names come from the default list of individual assessments that DMS supports for the associated migration task. This task is specified by ``ReplicationTaskArn``.

     

    .. note::

      

      You can't set a value for ``IncludeOnly`` if you also set a value for ``Exclude`` in the API operation.

       

      To identify the names of the default individual assessments that DMS supports for the associated migration task, run the ``DescribeApplicableIndividualAssessments`` operation using its own ``ReplicationTaskArn`` request parameter.

    .. note::

      

      You can't set a value for ``Exclude`` if you also set a value for ``IncludeOnly`` in the API operation.

       

      To identify the names of the default individual assessments that DMS supports for the associated migration task, run the ``DescribeApplicableIndividualAssessments`` operation using its own ``ReplicationTaskArn`` request parameter.

      

    

  
    - *(string) --*

      * ``ListTagsForResource``
       
      * ``RemoveTagsFromResource``
      

      

    
      - **Key** *(string) --* 

        A key is the required name of the tag. The string value can be 1-128 Unicode characters in length and can't be prefixed with "aws:" or "dms:". The string can only contain only the set of Unicode letters, digits, white-space, '_', '.', '/', '=', '+', '-' (Java regular expressions: "^([\\p{L}\\p{Z}\\p{N}_.:/=+\\-]*)$").

        

      
      - **Value** *(string) --* 

        A value is the optional value of the tag. The string value can be 1-256 Unicode characters in length and can't be prefixed with "aws:" or "dms:".
