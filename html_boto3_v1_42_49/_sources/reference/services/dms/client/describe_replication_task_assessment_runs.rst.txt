.. py:method:: DatabaseMigrationService.Client.describe_replication_task_assessment_runs(**kwargs)

  

  Returns a paginated list of premigration assessment runs based on filter settings.

   

  These filter settings can specify a combination of premigration assessment runs, migration tasks, replication instances, and assessment run status values.

   

  .. note::

    

    This operation doesn't return information about individual assessments. For this information, see the ``DescribeReplicationTaskIndividualAssessments`` operation.

            {
                'Name': 'string',

                    'string',

        MaxRecords=123,
        Marker='string'
    )
    
  :type Filters: list
  :param Filters: 

    Filters applied to the premigration assessment runs described in the form of key-value pairs.

     

    Valid filter names: ``replication-task-assessment-run-arn``, ``replication-task-arn``, ``replication-instance-arn``, ``status``

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      Identifies the name and value of a filter object. This filter is used to limit the number and type of DMS objects that are returned for a particular ``Describe*`` call or similar operation. Filters are used as an optional parameter for certain API operations.

      

    
      - **Name** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The name of the filter as specified for a ``Describe*`` or similar operation.

        

      
      - **Values** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The filter value, which can specify one or more values used to narrow the returned results.

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
    
    

  :type MaxRecords: integer
  :param MaxRecords: 

    The maximum number of records to include in the response. If more records exist than the specified ``MaxRecords`` value, a pagination token called a marker is included in the response so that the remaining results can be retrieved.

    

  
  :type Marker: string
  :param Marker: 

    An optional pagination token provided by a previous request. If this parameter is specified, the response includes only records beyond the marker, up to the value specified by ``MaxRecords``.

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **Marker** *(string) --* 

        A pagination token returned for you to pass to a subsequent request. If you pass this token as the ``Marker`` value in a subsequent request, the response includes only records beyond the marker, up to the value specified in the request by ``MaxRecords``.

          Provides information that describes a premigration assessment run that you have started using the ``StartReplicationTaskAssessmentRun`` operation.

           

          Some of the information appears based on other operations that can return the ``ReplicationTaskAssessmentRun`` object.

            * ``"failed"`` – At least one individual assessment completed with a ``failed`` status.
             
            * ``"error-provisioning"`` – An internal error occurred while resources were provisioned (during ``provisioning`` status).
             
            * ``"error-executing"`` – An internal error occurred while individual assessments ran (during ``running`` status).
             
            * ``"invalid state"`` – The assessment run is in an unknown state.
             
            * ``"passed"`` – All individual assessments have completed, and none has a ``failed`` status.
