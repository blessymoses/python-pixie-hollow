.. py:method:: DatabaseMigrationService.Client.describe_applicable_individual_assessments(**kwargs)

  

  Provides a list of individual assessments that you can specify for a new premigration assessment run, given one or more parameters.

   

  If you specify an existing migration task, this operation provides the default individual assessments you can specify for that task. Otherwise, the specified parameters model elements of a possible migration task on which to base a premigration assessment run.

   

  To use these migration task modeling parameters, you must specify an existing replication instance, a source database engine, a target database engine, and a migration type. This combination of parameters potentially limits the default individual assessments available for an assessment run created for a corresponding migration task.

   

  If you specify no parameters, this operation provides a list of all possible individual assessments that you can specify for an assessment run. If you specify any one of the task modeling parameters, you must specify all of them or the operation cannot provide a list of individual assessments. The only parameter that you can specify alone is for an existing migration task. The specified task definition then determines the default list of individual assessments that you can specify in an assessment run for the task.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.describe_applicable_individual_assessments(
        ReplicationTaskArn='string',
        ReplicationInstanceArn='string',
        ReplicationConfigArn='string',
        SourceEngineName='string',
        TargetEngineName='string',
        MigrationType='full-load'|'cdc'|'full-load-and-cdc',
        MaxRecords=123,
        Marker='string'
    )
    
  :type ReplicationTaskArn: string
  :param ReplicationTaskArn: 

    Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a migration task on which you want to base the default list of individual assessments.

    

  
  :type ReplicationInstanceArn: string
  :param ReplicationInstanceArn: 

    ARN of a replication instance on which you want to base the default list of individual assessments.

    

  
  :type ReplicationConfigArn: string
  :param ReplicationConfigArn: 

    Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a serverless replication on which you want to base the default list of individual assessments.

    

  
  :type SourceEngineName: string
  :param SourceEngineName: 

    Name of a database engine that the specified replication instance supports as a source.

    

  
  :type TargetEngineName: string
  :param TargetEngineName: 

    Name of a database engine that the specified replication instance supports as a target.

    

  
  :type MigrationType: string
  :param MigrationType: 

    Name of the migration type that each provided individual assessment must support.

    

  
  :type MaxRecords: integer
  :param MaxRecords: 

    Maximum number of records to include in the response. If more records exist than the specified ``MaxRecords`` value, a pagination token called a marker is included in the response so that the remaining results can be retrieved.

    

  
  :type Marker: string
  :param Marker: 

    Optional pagination token provided by a previous request. If this parameter is specified, the response includes only records beyond the marker, up to the value specified by ``MaxRecords``.

    ::

      {
          'IndividualAssessmentNames': [

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **IndividualAssessmentNames** *(list) --* 

        List of names for the individual assessments supported by the premigration assessment run that you start based on the specified request parameters. For more information on the available individual assessments, including compatibility with different migration task configurations, see `Working with premigration assessment runs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_Tasks.AssessmentReport.html>`__ in the *Database Migration Service User Guide.*

        
        

        - *(string) --* 
    
      

      - **Marker** *(string) --* 

        Pagination token returned for you to pass to a subsequent request. If you pass this token as the ``Marker`` value in a subsequent request, the response includes only records beyond the marker, up to the value specified in the request by ``MaxRecords``.
