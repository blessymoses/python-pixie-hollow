                'Name': 'string',

        MaxRecords=123,
        NextToken='string'
    )
    
  :type Filters: list
  :param Filters: 

    Filters applied to the target engine recommendations described in the form of key-value pairs.

     

    Valid filter names: ``database-id`` | ``engine-name``

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      Identifies the name and value of a filter object. This filter is used to limit the number and type of DMS objects that are returned for a particular ``Describe*`` call or similar operation. Filters are used as an optional parameter for certain API operations.

      

    
      - **Name** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The name of the filter as specified for a ``Describe*`` or similar operation.

        

      
      - **Values** *(list) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The filter value, which can specify one or more values used to narrow the returned results.

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
    
    

  :type MaxRecords: integer
  :param MaxRecords: 

    The maximum number of records to include in the response. If more records exist than the specified ``MaxRecords`` value, Fleet Advisor includes a pagination token in the response so that you can retrieve the remaining results.

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    Specifies the unique pagination token that makes it possible to display the next page of results. If this parameter is specified, the response includes only records beyond the marker, up to the value specified by ``MaxRecords``.

     

    If ``NextToken`` is returned by a previous response, there are more results available. The value of ``NextToken`` is a unique pagination token for each page. Make the call again using the returned token to retrieve the next page. Keep all other arguments unchanged.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

        The unique pagination token returned for you to pass to a subsequent request. Fleet Advisor returns this token when the number of records in the response is greater than the ``MaxRecords`` value. To retrieve the next page, make the call again using the returned token and keeping all other arguments unchanged.

        
      

      - **Recommendations** *(list) --* 

        The list of recommendations of target engines that Fleet Advisor created for the source database.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          Provides information that describes a recommendation of a target engine.

           

          A *recommendation* is a set of possible Amazon Web Services target engines that you can choose to migrate your source on-premises database. In this set, Fleet Advisor suggests a single target engine as the right sized migration destination. To determine this rightsized migration destination, Fleet Advisor uses the inventory metadata and metrics from data collector. You can use recommendations before the start of migration to save costs and reduce risks.

           

          With recommendations, you can explore different target options and compare metrics, so you can make an informed decision when you choose the migration target.

          
          

          - **DatabaseId** *(string) --* 

            The identifier of the source database for which Fleet Advisor provided this recommendation.
