    End of support notice: On May 20, 2026, Amazon Web Services will end support for Amazon Web Services DMS Fleet Advisor;. After May 20, 2026, you will no longer be able to access the Amazon Web Services DMS Fleet Advisor; console or Amazon Web Services DMS Fleet Advisor; resources. For more information, see `Amazon Web Services DMS Fleet Advisor end of support <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/dms_fleet.advisor-end-of-support.html>`__.

     

   

  Starts the analysis of up to 20 source databases to recommend target engines for each source database. This is a batch version of `StartRecommendations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_StartRecommendations.html>`__.

   

  The result of analysis of each source database is reported individually in the response. Because the batch request can result in a combination of successful and unsuccessful actions, you should check for batch errors even when the call returns an HTTP status code of ``200``.
