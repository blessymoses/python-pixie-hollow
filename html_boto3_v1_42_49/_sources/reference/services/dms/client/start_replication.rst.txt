.. py:method:: DatabaseMigrationService.Client.start_replication(**kwargs)

  

  For a given DMS Serverless replication configuration, DMS connects to the source endpoint and collects the metadata to analyze the replication workload. Using this metadata, DMS then computes and provisions the required capacity and starts replicating to the target endpoint using the server resources that DMS has provisioned for the DMS Serverless replication.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.start_replication(
        ReplicationConfigArn='string',
        StartReplicationType='string',
        PremigrationAssessmentSettings='string',
        CdcStartTime=datetime(2015, 1, 1),
        CdcStartPosition='string',
        CdcStopPosition='string'
    )
    
  :type ReplicationConfigArn: string
  :param ReplicationConfigArn: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The Amazon Resource Name of the replication for which to start replication.

    

  
  :type StartReplicationType: string
  :param StartReplicationType: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The replication type.

     

    When the replication type is ``full-load`` or ``full-load-and-cdc``, the only valid value for the first run of the replication is ``start-replication``. This option will start the replication.

     

    You can also use  ReloadTables to reload specific tables that failed during replication instead of restarting the replication.

     

    The ``resume-processing`` option isn't applicable for a full-load replication, because you can't resume partially loaded tables during the full load phase.

     

    For a ``full-load-and-cdc`` replication, DMS migrates table data, and then applies data changes that occur on the source. To load all the tables again, and start capturing source changes, use ``reload-target``. Otherwise use ``resume-processing``, to replicate the changes from the last stop position.

    

  
  :type PremigrationAssessmentSettings: string
  :param PremigrationAssessmentSettings: 

    User-defined settings for the premigration assessment. The possible values are:

     

    
    * ``ResultLocationFolder``: The folder within an Amazon S3 bucket where you want DMS to store the results of this assessment run.
     
    * ``ResultEncryptionMode``: The supported values are ``SSE_KMS`` and ``SSE_S3``. If these values are not provided, then the files are not encrypted at rest. For more information, see `Creating Amazon Web Services KMS keys to encrypt Amazon S3 target objects <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_Target.S3.html#CHAP_Target.S3.KMSKeys>`__.
     
    * ``ResultKmsKeyArn``: The ARN of a customer KMS encryption key that you specify when you set ``ResultEncryptionMode`` to ``SSE_KMS``.
     
    * ``IncludeOnly``: A space-separated list of names for specific individual assessments that you want to include. These names come from the default list of individual assessments that Database Migration Service supports for the associated migration.
     
    * ``Exclude``: A space-separated list of names for specific individual assessments that you want to exclude. These names come from the default list of individual assessments that Database Migration Service supports for the associated migration.
     
    * ``FailOnAssessmentFailure``: A configurable setting you can set to ``true`` (the default setting) or ``false``. Use this setting to to stop the replication from starting automatically if the assessment fails. This can help you evaluate the issue that is preventing the replication from running successfully.
    

    

  
  :type CdcStartTime: datetime
  :param CdcStartTime: 

    Indicates the start time for a change data capture (CDC) operation. Use either ``CdcStartTime`` or ``CdcStartPosition`` to specify when you want a CDC operation to start. Specifying both values results in an error.

    

  
  :type CdcStartPosition: string
  :param CdcStartPosition: 

    Indicates when you want a change data capture (CDC) operation to start. Use either ``CdcStartPosition`` or ``CdcStartTime`` to specify when you want a CDC operation to start. Specifying both values results in an error.

     

    The value can be in date, checkpoint, or LSN/SCN format.

    

  
  :type CdcStopPosition: string
  :param CdcStopPosition: 

    Indicates when you want a change data capture (CDC) operation to stop. The value can be either server time or commit time.

            The date the replication is scheduled to start.

            
          

          - **StopDate** *(datetime) --* 

            The date the replication was stopped.

            
          

          - **FullLoadStartDate** *(datetime) --* 

            The date the replication full load was started.

            
          

          - **FullLoadFinishDate** *(datetime) --* 

            The date the replication full load was finished.

            
      
        

        - **StartReplicationType** *(string) --* 

          The type of replication to start.

          
        

        - **CdcStartTime** *(datetime) --* 

          Indicates the start time for a change data capture (CDC) operation. Use either ``CdcStartTime`` or ``CdcStartPosition`` to specify when you want a CDC operation to start. Specifying both values results in an error.

          
        

        - **CdcStartPosition** *(string) --* 

          Indicates the start time for a change data capture (CDC) operation. Use either ``CdcStartTime`` or ``CdcStartPosition`` to specify when you want a CDC operation to start. Specifying both values results in an error.

          
        

        - **CdcStopPosition** *(string) --* 

          Indicates when you want a change data capture (CDC) operation to stop. The value can be either server time or commit time.

          
        

        - **RecoveryCheckpoint** *(string) --* 

          Indicates the last checkpoint that occurred during a change data capture (CDC) operation. You can provide this value to the ``CdcStartPosition`` parameter to start a CDC operation that begins at that checkpoint.

          
        

        - **ReplicationCreateTime** *(datetime) --* 

          The time the serverless replication was created.

          
        

        - **ReplicationUpdateTime** *(datetime) --* 

          The time the serverless replication was updated.

          
        

        - **ReplicationLastStopTime** *(datetime) --* 

          The timestamp when replication was last stopped.

          
        

        - **ReplicationDeprovisionTime** *(datetime) --* 

          The timestamp when DMS will deprovision the replication.

          
        

        - **IsReadOnly** *(boolean) --* 

          Indicates whether the serverless replication is read-only. When set to ``true``, this replication is managed by DMS as part of a zero-ETL integration and cannot be modified or deleted directly. You can only modify or delete read-only replications through their associated zero-ETL integration.
