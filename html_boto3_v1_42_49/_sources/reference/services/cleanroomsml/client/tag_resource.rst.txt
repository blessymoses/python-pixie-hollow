  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.tag_resource(
        resourceArn='string',
        tags={
            'string': 'string'
        }
    )
    
  :type resourceArn: string
  :param resourceArn: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource that you want to assign tags.

    

  
  :type tags: dict
  :param tags: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The optional metadata that you apply to the resource to help you categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define.

     

    The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

     

    
    * Maximum number of tags per resource - 50.
     
    * For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value.
     
    * Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.
     
    * Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.
     
    * If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.
     
    * Tag keys and values are case sensitive.
     
    * Do not use aws:, AWS:, or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for keys as it is reserved for AWS use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys with this prefix. Values can have this prefix. If a tag value has aws as its prefix but the key does not, then Clean Rooms considers it to be a user tag and will count against the limit of 50 tags. Tags with only the key prefix of aws do not count against your tags per resource limit.
