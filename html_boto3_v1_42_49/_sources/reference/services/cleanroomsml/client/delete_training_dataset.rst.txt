.. py:method:: CleanRoomsML.Client.delete_training_dataset(**kwargs)

  

  Specifies a training dataset that you want to delete. You can't delete a training dataset if there are any audience models that depend on the training dataset. In Clean Rooms ML, the ``TrainingDataset`` is metadata that points to a Glue table, which is read only during ``AudienceModel`` creation. This action deletes the metadata.
