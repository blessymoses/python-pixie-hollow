          MustBeOwnedByCaller=True|False,

          }
      )
      
    :type Query: string
    :param Query: 

      A text query against all of the searchable attributes of Qualification types.

      

    
    :type MustBeRequestable: boolean
    :param MustBeRequestable: **[REQUIRED]** 

      Specifies that only Qualification types that a user can request through the Amazon Mechanical Turk web site, such as by taking a Qualification test, are returned as results of the search. Some Qualification types, such as those assigned automatically by the system, cannot be requested directly by users. If false, all Qualification types, including those managed by the system, are considered. Valid values are True | False.

      

    
    :type MustBeOwnedByCaller: boolean
    :param MustBeOwnedByCaller: 

      Specifies that only Qualification types that the Requester created are returned. If false, the operation returns all Qualification types.

      

    
    :type PaginationConfig: dict
    :param PaginationConfig: 

      A dictionary that provides parameters to control pagination.

      

    
      - **MaxItems** *(integer) --* 

        The total number of items to return. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified in max-items then a ``NextToken`` will be provided in the output that you can use to resume pagination.

        

      
      - **PageSize** *(integer) --* 

        The size of each page.

        

      
      - **StartingToken** *(string) --* 

        A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previous response.

      **Response Structure**

      

      - *(dict) --* 
        

        - **NumResults** *(integer) --* 

          The number of Qualification types on this page in the filtered results list, equivalent to the number of types this operation returns.

          
        

        - **QualificationTypes** *(list) --* 

          The list of QualificationType elements returned by the query.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            The QualificationType data structure represents a Qualification type, a description of a property of a Worker that must match the requirements of a HIT for the Worker to be able to accept the HIT. The type also describes how a Worker can obtain a Qualification of that type, such as through a Qualification test.

            
            

            - **QualificationTypeId** *(string) --* 

              A unique identifier for the Qualification type. A Qualification type is given a Qualification type ID when you call the CreateQualificationType operation.

              
            

            - **CreationTime** *(datetime) --* 

              The date and time the Qualification type was created.

              
            

            - **Name** *(string) --* 

              The name of the Qualification type. The type name is used to identify the type, and to find the type using a Qualification type search.

              
            

            - **Description** *(string) --* 

              A long description for the Qualification type.

              
            

            - **Keywords** *(string) --* 

              One or more words or phrases that describe theQualification type, separated by commas. The Keywords make the type easier to find using a search.

              
            

            - **QualificationTypeStatus** *(string) --* 

              The status of the Qualification type. A Qualification type's status determines if users can apply to receive a Qualification of this type, and if HITs can be created with requirements based on this type. Valid values are Active | Inactive.

              
            

            - **Test** *(string) --* 

              The questions for a Qualification test associated with this Qualification type that a user can take to obtain a Qualification of this type. This parameter must be specified if AnswerKey is present. A Qualification type cannot have both a specified Test parameter and an AutoGranted value of true.

              
            

            - **TestDurationInSeconds** *(integer) --* 

              The amount of time, in seconds, given to a Worker to complete the Qualification test, beginning from the time the Worker requests the Qualification.

              
            

            - **AnswerKey** *(string) --* 

              The answers to the Qualification test specified in the Test parameter.

              
            

            - **RetryDelayInSeconds** *(integer) --* 

              The amount of time, in seconds, Workers must wait after taking the Qualification test before they can take it again. Workers can take a Qualification test multiple times if they were not granted the Qualification from a previous attempt, or if the test offers a gradient score and they want a better score. If not specified, retries are disabled and Workers can request a Qualification only once.

              
            

            - **IsRequestable** *(boolean) --* 

              Specifies whether the Qualification type is one that a user can request through the Amazon Mechanical Turk web site, such as by taking a Qualification test. This value is False for Qualifications assigned automatically by the system. Valid values are True | False.

              
            

            - **AutoGranted** *(boolean) --* 

              Specifies that requests for the Qualification type are granted immediately, without prompting the Worker with a Qualification test. Valid values are True | False.

              
            

            - **AutoGrantedValue** *(integer) --* 

              The Qualification integer value to use for automatically granted Qualifications, if AutoGranted is true. This is 1 by default.
