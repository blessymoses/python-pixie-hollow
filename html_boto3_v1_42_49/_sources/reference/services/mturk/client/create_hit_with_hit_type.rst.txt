.. py:method:: MTurk.Client.create_hit_with_hit_type(**kwargs)

  

  The ``CreateHITWithHITType`` operation creates a new Human Intelligence Task (HIT) using an existing HITTypeID generated by the ``CreateHITType`` operation.

   

  This is an alternative way to create HITs from the ``CreateHIT`` operation. This is the recommended best practice for Requesters who are creating large numbers of HITs.

   

  CreateHITWithHITType also supports several ways to provide question data: by providing a value for the ``Question`` parameter that fully specifies the contents of the HIT, or by providing a ``HitLayoutId`` and associated ``HitLayoutParameters``.

   

  .. note::

    

    If a HIT is created with 10 or more maximum assignments, there is an additional fee. For more information, see `Amazon Mechanical Turk Pricing <https://requester.mturk.com/pricing>`__.

        ]
    )
    
  :type HITTypeId: string
  :param HITTypeId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The HIT type ID you want to create this HIT with.

    

  
  :type MaxAssignments: integer
  :param MaxAssignments: 

    The number of times the HIT can be accepted and completed before the HIT becomes unavailable.

    

  
  :type LifetimeInSeconds: integer
  :param LifetimeInSeconds: **[REQUIRED]** 

    An amount of time, in seconds, after which the HIT is no longer available for users to accept. After the lifetime of the HIT elapses, the HIT no longer appears in HIT searches, even if not all of the assignments for the HIT have been accepted.

    

  
  :type Question: string
  :param Question: 

    The data the person completing the HIT uses to produce the results.

     

    Constraints: Must be a QuestionForm data structure, an ExternalQuestion data structure, or an HTMLQuestion data structure. The XML question data must not be larger than 64 kilobytes (65,535 bytes) in size, including whitespace.

     

    Either a Question parameter or a HITLayoutId parameter must be provided.

    

  
  :type RequesterAnnotation: string
  :param RequesterAnnotation: 

    An arbitrary data field. The RequesterAnnotation parameter lets your application attach arbitrary data to the HIT for tracking purposes. For example, this parameter could be an identifier internal to the Requester's application that corresponds with the HIT.

     

    The RequesterAnnotation parameter for a HIT is only visible to the Requester who created the HIT. It is not shown to the Worker, or any other Requester.

     

    The RequesterAnnotation parameter may be different for each HIT you submit. It does not affect how your HITs are grouped.

    

  
  :type UniqueRequestToken: string
  :param UniqueRequestToken: 

    A unique identifier for this request which allows you to retry the call on error without creating duplicate HITs. This is useful in cases such as network timeouts where it is unclear whether or not the call succeeded on the server. If the HIT already exists in the system from a previous call using the same UniqueRequestToken, subsequent calls will return a AWS.MechanicalTurk.HitAlreadyExists error with a message containing the HITId.

     

    .. note::

      

      Note: It is your responsibility to ensure uniqueness of the token. The unique token expires after 24 hours. Subsequent calls using the same UniqueRequestToken made after the 24 hour limit could create duplicate HITs.

        - **Keywords** *(string) --* 

          One or more words or phrases that describe the HIT, separated by commas. Search terms similar to the keywords of a HIT are more likely to have the HIT in the search results.

          
        

        - **HITStatus** *(string) --* 

          The status of the HIT and its assignments. Valid Values are Assignable | Unassignable | Reviewable | Reviewing | Disposed.

          An arbitrary data field the Requester who created the HIT can use. This field is visible only to the creator of the HIT.

          
        

        - **QualificationRequirements** *(list) --* 

          Conditions that a Worker's Qualifications must meet in order to accept the HIT. A HIT can have between zero and ten Qualification requirements. All requirements must be met in order for a Worker to accept the HIT. Additionally, other actions can be restricted using the ``ActionsGuarded`` field on each ``QualificationRequirement`` structure.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            The QualificationRequirement data structure describes a Qualification that a Worker must have before the Worker is allowed to accept a HIT. A requirement may optionally state that a Worker must have the Qualification in order to preview the HIT, or see the HIT in search results.

            
            

            - **QualificationTypeId** *(string) --* 

              The ID of the Qualification type for the requirement.

              
            

            - **Comparator** *(string) --* 

              The kind of comparison to make against a Qualification's value. You can compare a Qualification's value to an IntegerValue to see if it is LessThan, LessThanOrEqualTo, GreaterThan, GreaterThanOrEqualTo, EqualTo, or NotEqualTo the IntegerValue. You can compare it to a LocaleValue to see if it is EqualTo, or NotEqualTo the LocaleValue. You can check to see if the value is In or NotIn a set of IntegerValue or LocaleValue values. Lastly, a Qualification requirement can also test if a Qualification Exists or DoesNotExist in the user's profile, regardless of its value.

              
            

            - **IntegerValues** *(list) --* 

              The integer value to compare against the Qualification's value. IntegerValue must not be present if Comparator is Exists or DoesNotExist. IntegerValue can only be used if the Qualification type has an integer value; it cannot be used with the Worker_Locale QualificationType ID. When performing a set comparison by using the In or the NotIn comparator, you can use up to 15 IntegerValue elements in a QualificationRequirement data structure.

              
              

              - *(integer) --* 
          
            

            - **LocaleValues** *(list) --* 

              The locale value to compare against the Qualification's value. The local value must be a valid ISO 3166 country code or supports ISO 3166-2 subdivisions. LocaleValue can only be used with a Worker_Locale QualificationType ID. LocaleValue can only be used with the EqualTo, NotEqualTo, In, and NotIn comparators. You must only use a single LocaleValue element when using the EqualTo or NotEqualTo comparators. When performing a set comparison by using the In or the NotIn comparator, you can use up to 30 LocaleValue elements in a QualificationRequirement data structure.

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                The Locale data structure represents a geographical region or location.

                
                

                - **Country** *(string) --* 

                  The country of the locale. Must be a valid ISO 3166 country code. For example, the code US refers to the United States of America.

                  
                

                - **Subdivision** *(string) --* 

                  The state or subdivision of the locale. A valid ISO 3166-2 subdivision code. For example, the code WA refers to the state of Washington.

                  
            
          
            

            - **RequiredToPreview** *(boolean) --* 

              DEPRECATED: Use the ``ActionsGuarded`` field instead. If RequiredToPreview is true, the question data for the HIT will not be shown when a Worker whose Qualifications do not meet this requirement tries to preview the HIT. That is, a Worker's Qualifications must meet all of the requirements for which RequiredToPreview is true in order to preview the HIT. If a Worker meets all of the requirements where RequiredToPreview is true (or if there are no such requirements), but does not meet all of the requirements for the HIT, the Worker will be allowed to preview the HIT's question data, but will not be allowed to accept and complete the HIT. The default is false. This should not be used in combination with the ``ActionsGuarded`` field.

              
            

            - **ActionsGuarded** *(string) --* 

              Setting this attribute prevents Workers whose Qualifications do not meet this QualificationRequirement from taking the specified action. Valid arguments include "Accept" (Worker cannot accept the HIT, but can preview the HIT and see it in their search results), "PreviewAndAccept" (Worker cannot accept or preview the HIT, but can see the HIT in their search results), and "DiscoverPreviewAndAccept" (Worker cannot accept, preview, or see the HIT in their search results). It's possible for you to create a HIT with multiple QualificationRequirements (which can have different values for the ActionGuarded attribute). In this case, the Worker is only permitted to perform an action when they have met all QualificationRequirements guarding the action. The actions in the order of least restrictive to most restrictive are Discover, Preview and Accept.

ActionsGuarded should not be used in combination with the ``RequiredToPreview`` field.
