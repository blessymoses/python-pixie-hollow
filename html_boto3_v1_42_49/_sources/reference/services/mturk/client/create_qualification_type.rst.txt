  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.create_qualification_type(
        Name='string',
        Keywords='string',
        Description='string',
        QualificationTypeStatus='Active'|'Inactive',
        RetryDelayInSeconds=123,
        Test='string',
        AnswerKey='string',
        TestDurationInSeconds=123,
        AutoGranted=True|False,
        AutoGrantedValue=123
    )
    
  :type Name: string
  :param Name: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name you give to the Qualification type. The type name is used to represent the Qualification to Workers, and to find the type using a Qualification type search. It must be unique across all of your Qualification types.

    

  
  :type Keywords: string
  :param Keywords: 

    One or more words or phrases that describe the Qualification type, separated by commas. The keywords of a type make the type easier to find during a search.

    

  
  :type Description: string
  :param Description: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A long description for the Qualification type. On the Amazon Mechanical Turk website, the long description is displayed when a Worker examines a Qualification type.

    

  
  :type QualificationTypeStatus: string
  :param QualificationTypeStatus: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The initial status of the Qualification type.

     

    Constraints: Valid values are: Active | Inactive

    

  
  :type RetryDelayInSeconds: integer
  :param RetryDelayInSeconds: 

    The number of seconds that a Worker must wait after requesting a Qualification of the Qualification type before the worker can retry the Qualification request.

     

    Constraints: None. If not specified, retries are disabled and Workers can request a Qualification of this type only once, even if the Worker has not been granted the Qualification. It is not possible to disable retries for a Qualification type after it has been created with retries enabled. If you want to disable retries, you must delete existing retry-enabled Qualification type and then create a new Qualification type with retries disabled.

    

  
  :type Test: string
  :param Test: 

    The questions for the Qualification test a Worker must answer correctly to obtain a Qualification of this type. If this parameter is specified, ``TestDurationInSeconds`` must also be specified.

     

    Constraints: Must not be longer than 65535 bytes. Must be a QuestionForm data structure. This parameter cannot be specified if AutoGranted is true.

     

    Constraints: None. If not specified, the Worker may request the Qualification without answering any questions.

    

  
  :type AnswerKey: string
  :param AnswerKey: 

    The answers to the Qualification test specified in the Test parameter, in the form of an AnswerKey data structure.

     

    Constraints: Must not be longer than 65535 bytes.

     

    Constraints: None. If not specified, you must process Qualification requests manually.

    

  
  :type TestDurationInSeconds: integer
  :param TestDurationInSeconds: 

    The number of seconds the Worker has to complete the Qualification test, starting from the time the Worker requests the Qualification.

    

  
  :type AutoGranted: boolean
  :param AutoGranted: 

    Specifies whether requests for the Qualification type are granted immediately, without prompting the Worker with a Qualification test.

     

    Constraints: If the Test parameter is specified, this parameter cannot be true.

    

  
  :type AutoGrantedValue: integer
  :param AutoGrantedValue: 

    The Qualification value to use for automatically granted Qualifications. This parameter is used only if the AutoGranted parameter is true.

        - **Test** *(string) --* 

          The questions for a Qualification test associated with this Qualification type that a user can take to obtain a Qualification of this type. This parameter must be specified if AnswerKey is present. A Qualification type cannot have both a specified Test parameter and an AutoGranted value of true.

          
        

        - **TestDurationInSeconds** *(integer) --*
