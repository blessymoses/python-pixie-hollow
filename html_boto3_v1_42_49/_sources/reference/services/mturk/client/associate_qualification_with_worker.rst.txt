.. py:method:: MTurk.Client.associate_qualification_with_worker(**kwargs)

  

  The ``AssociateQualificationWithWorker`` operation gives a Worker a Qualification. ``AssociateQualificationWithWorker`` does not require that the Worker submit a Qualification request. It gives the Qualification directly to the Worker.

   

  You can only assign a Qualification of a Qualification type that you created (using the ``CreateQualificationType`` operation).

   

  .. note::

    

    Note: ``AssociateQualificationWithWorker`` does not affect any pending Qualification requests for the Qualification by the Worker. If you assign a Qualification to a Worker, then later grant a Qualification request made by the Worker, the granting of the request may modify the Qualification score. To resolve a pending Qualification request without affecting the Qualification the Worker already has, reject the request with the ``RejectQualificationRequest`` operation.
