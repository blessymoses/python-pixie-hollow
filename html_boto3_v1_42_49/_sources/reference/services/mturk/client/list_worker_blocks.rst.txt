    **Response Syntax**

    
    ::

      {
          'NextToken': 'string',
          'NumResults': 123,
          'WorkerBlocks': [
              {

                  'Reason': 'string'

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

        If the previous response was incomplete (because there is more data to retrieve), Amazon Mechanical Turk returns a pagination token in the response. You can use this pagination token to retrieve the next set of results.

        
      

      - **NumResults** *(integer) --* 

        The number of assignments on the page in the filtered results list, equivalent to the number of assignments returned by this call.

        
      

      - **WorkerBlocks** *(list) --* 

        The list of WorkerBlocks, containing the collection of Worker IDs and reasons for blocking.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          The WorkerBlock data structure represents a Worker who has been blocked. It has two elements: the WorkerId and the Reason for the block.

          
          

          - **WorkerId** *(string) --* 

            The ID of the Worker who accepted the HIT.

            
          

          - **Reason** *(string) --* 

            A message explaining the reason the Worker was blocked.
