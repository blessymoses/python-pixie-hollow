    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 

      The result of a DescribeConditionalForwarder request.

      
      

      - **ConditionalForwarders** *(list) --* 

        The list of conditional forwarders that have been created.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          Points to a remote domain with which you are setting up a trust relationship. Conditional forwarders are required in order to set up a trust relationship with another domain.

          
          

          - **RemoteDomainName** *(string) --* 

            The fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the remote domains pointed to by the conditional forwarder.

            
          

          - **DnsIpAddrs** *(list) --* 

            The IP addresses of the remote DNS server associated with RemoteDomainName. This is the IP address of the DNS server that your conditional forwarder points to.

            
            

            - *(string) --* 
        
          

          - **DnsIpv6Addrs** *(list) --* 

            The IPv6 addresses of the remote DNS server associated with RemoteDomainName. This is the IPv6 address of the DNS server that your conditional forwarder points to.

            
            

            - *(string) --* 
        
          

          - **ReplicationScope** *(string) --* 

            The replication scope of the conditional forwarder. The only allowed value is ``Domain``, which will replicate the conditional forwarder to all of the domain controllers for your Amazon Web Services directory.
