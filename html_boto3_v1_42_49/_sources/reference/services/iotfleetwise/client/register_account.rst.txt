.. py:method:: IoTFleetWise.Client.register_account(**kwargs)

  

  .. warning::

    

    This API operation contains deprecated parameters. Register your account again without the Timestream resources parameter so that Amazon Web Services IoT FleetWise can remove the Timestream metadata stored. You should then pass the data destination into the `CreateCampaign <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-fleetwise/latest/APIReference/API_CreateCampaign.html>`__ API operation.

     

    You must delete any existing campaigns that include an empty data destination before you register your account again. For more information, see the `DeleteCampaign <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-fleetwise/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteCampaign.html>`__ API operation.

     

    If you want to delete the Timestream inline policy from the service-linked role, such as to mitigate an overly permissive policy, you must first delete any existing campaigns. Then delete the service-linked role and register your account again to enable CloudWatch metrics. For more information, see `DeleteServiceLinkedRole <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteServiceLinkedRole.html>`__ in the *Identity and Access Management API Reference*.

     

   

  Registers your Amazon Web Services account, IAM, and Amazon Timestream resources so Amazon Web Services IoT FleetWise can transfer your vehicle data to the Amazon Web Services Cloud. For more information, including step-by-step procedures, see `Setting up Amazon Web Services IoT FleetWise <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-fleetwise/latest/developerguide/setting-up.html>`__.

   

  .. note::

    

    An Amazon Web Services account is **not** the same thing as a "user." An `Amazon Web Services user <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction_identity-management.html#intro-identity-users>`__ is an identity that you create using Identity and Access Management (IAM) and takes the form of either an `IAM user <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users.html>`__ or an `IAM role, both with credentials <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html>`__. A single Amazon Web Services account can, and typically does, contain many users and roles.
