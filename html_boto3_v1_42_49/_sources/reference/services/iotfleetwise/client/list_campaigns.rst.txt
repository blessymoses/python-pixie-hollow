  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_campaigns(
        nextToken='string',
        maxResults=123,
        status='string',
        listResponseScope='METADATA_ONLY'
    )
    
  :type nextToken: string
  :param nextToken: 

    A pagination token for the next set of results.

     

    If the results of a search are large, only a portion of the results are returned, and a ``nextToken`` pagination token is returned in the response. To retrieve the next set of results, reissue the search request and include the returned token. When all results have been returned, the response does not contain a pagination token value.

    

  
  :type maxResults: integer
  :param maxResults: 

    The maximum number of items to return, between 1 and 100, inclusive.

    

  
  :type status: string
  :param status: 

    An optional parameter to filter the results by the status of each created campaign in your account. The status can be one of: ``CREATING``, ``WAITING_FOR_APPROVAL``, ``RUNNING``, or ``SUSPENDED``.

    

  
  :type listResponseScope: string
  :param listResponseScope: 

    When you set the ``listResponseScope`` parameter to ``METADATA_ONLY``, the list response includes: campaign name, Amazon Resource Name (ARN), creation time, and last modification time.
