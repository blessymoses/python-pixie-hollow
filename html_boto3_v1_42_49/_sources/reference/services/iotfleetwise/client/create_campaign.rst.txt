.. py:method:: IoTFleetWise.Client.create_campaign(**kwargs)

  

  Creates an orchestration of data collection rules. The Amazon Web Services IoT FleetWise Edge Agent software running in vehicles uses campaigns to decide how to collect and transfer data to the cloud. You create campaigns in the cloud. After you or your team approve campaigns, Amazon Web Services IoT FleetWise automatically deploys them to vehicles.

   

  For more information, see `Collect and transfer data with campaigns <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-fleetwise/latest/developerguide/campaigns.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services IoT FleetWise Developer Guide*.

      - **dataPartitionId** *(string) --* 

        The ID of the data partition this signal is associated with.

         

        The ID must match one of the IDs provided in ``dataPartitions``. This is accomplished either by specifying a particular data partition ID or by using ``default`` for an established default partition. You can establish a default partition in the ``DataPartition`` data type.

         

        .. note::

          

          If you upload a signal as a condition for a campaign's data partition, the same signal must be included in ``signalsToCollect``.

  :type collectionScheme: dict
  :param collectionScheme: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The data collection scheme associated with the campaign. You can specify a scheme that collects data based on time or an event.

    .. note::    This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the     following top level keys can be set: ``timeBasedCollectionScheme``, ``conditionBasedCollectionScheme``. 

  
    - **timeBasedCollectionScheme** *(dict) --* 

      Information about a collection scheme that uses a time period to decide how often to collect data.

      

    
      - **periodMs** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The time period (in milliseconds) to decide how often to collect data. For example, if the time period is ``60000``, the Edge Agent software collects data once every minute.

        

      
    
    - **conditionBasedCollectionScheme** *(dict) --* 

      Information about a collection scheme that uses a simple logical expression to recognize what data to collect.

      - **triggerMode** *(string) --* 

        Whether to collect data for all triggering events ( ``ALWAYS``). Specify ( ``RISING_EDGE``), or specify only when the condition first evaluates to false. For example, triggering on "AirbagDeployed"; Users aren't interested on triggering when the airbag is already exploded; they only care about the change from not deployed => deployed.

        

      
      - **conditionLanguageVersion** *(integer) --* 

        Specifies the version of the conditional expression language.

        

      
    
  
  :type dataExtraDimensions: list
  :param dataExtraDimensions: 

    A list of vehicle attributes to associate with a campaign.

     

    Enrich the data with specified vehicle attributes. For example, add ``make`` and ``model`` to the campaign, and Amazon Web Services IoT FleetWise will associate the data with those attributes as dimensions in Amazon Timestream. You can then query the data against ``make`` and ``model``.

     

    Default: An empty array

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type tags: list
  :param tags:

  :type dataDestinationConfigs: list
  :param dataDestinationConfigs: 

    The destination where the campaign sends data. You can send data to an MQTT topic, or store it in Amazon S3 or Amazon Timestream.

     

    MQTT is the publish/subscribe messaging protocol used by Amazon Web Services IoT to communicate with your devices.

     

    Amazon S3 optimizes the cost of data storage and provides additional mechanisms to use vehicle data, such as data lakes, centralized data storage, data processing pipelines, and analytics. Amazon Web Services IoT FleetWise supports at-least-once file delivery to S3. Your vehicle data is stored on multiple Amazon Web Services IoT FleetWise servers for redundancy and high availability.

     

    You can use Amazon Timestream to access and analyze time series data, and Timestream to query vehicle data so that you can identify trends and patterns.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      The destination where the campaign sends data. You can send data to an MQTT topic, or store it in Amazon S3 or Amazon Timestream.

      .. note::    This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the     following top level keys can be set: ``s3Config``, ``timestreamConfig``, ``mqttTopicConfig``. 

    
      - **s3Config** *(dict) --* 

        The Amazon S3 bucket where the Amazon Web Services IoT FleetWise campaign sends data.

        

      
        - **bucketArn** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon S3 bucket.

          

        
        - **dataFormat** *(string) --* 

          Specify the format that files are saved in the Amazon S3 bucket. You can save files in an Apache Parquet or JSON format.

           

          
          * Parquet - Store data in a columnar storage file format. Parquet is optimal for fast data retrieval and can reduce costs. This option is selected by default.
           
          * JSON - Store data in a standard text-based JSON file format.
          

          

        
        - **storageCompressionFormat** *(string) --* 

          By default, stored data is compressed as a .gzip file. Compressed files have a reduced file size, which can optimize the cost of data storage.

          

        
        - **prefix** *(string) --* 

          Enter an S3 bucket prefix. The prefix is the string of characters after the bucket name and before the object name. You can use the prefix to organize data stored in Amazon S3 buckets. For more information, see `Organizing objects using prefixes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-prefixes.html>`__ in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide*.

           

          By default, Amazon Web Services IoT FleetWise sets the prefix ``processed-data/year=YY/month=MM/date=DD/hour=HH/`` (in UTC) to data it delivers to Amazon S3. You can enter a prefix to append it to this default prefix. For example, if you enter the prefix ``vehicles``, the prefix will be ``vehicles/processed-data/year=YY/month=MM/date=DD/hour=HH/``.

          

        
      
      - **timestreamConfig** *(dict) --* 

        The Amazon Timestream table where the campaign sends data.

        

      
        - **timestreamTableArn** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Timestream table.

          

        
        - **executionRoleArn** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the task execution role that grants Amazon Web Services IoT FleetWise permission to deliver data to the Amazon Timestream table.

          

        
      
      - **mqttTopicConfig** *(dict) --*

  :param dataPartitions: 

    The data partitions associated with the signals collected from the vehicle.
