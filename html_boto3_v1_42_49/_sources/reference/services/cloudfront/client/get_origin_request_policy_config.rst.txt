.. py:method:: CloudFront.Client.get_origin_request_policy_config(**kwargs)

  

  Gets an origin request policy configuration.

   

  To get an origin request policy configuration, you must provide the policy's identifier. If the origin request policy is attached to a distribution's cache behavior, you can get the policy's identifier using ``ListDistributions`` or ``GetDistribution``. If the origin request policy is not attached to a cache behavior, you can get the identifier using ``ListOriginRequestPolicies``.
