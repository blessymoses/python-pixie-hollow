.. py:method:: CloudFront.Client.create_cache_policy(**kwargs)

  

  Creates a cache policy.

   

  After you create a cache policy, you can attach it to one or more cache behaviors. When it's attached to a cache behavior, the cache policy determines the following:

   

  
  * The values that CloudFront includes in the *cache key*. These values can include HTTP headers, cookies, and URL query strings. CloudFront uses the cache key to find an object in its cache that it can return to the viewer.
   
  * The default, minimum, and maximum time to live (TTL) values that you want objects to stay in the CloudFront cache. 

  .. warning::

    If your minimum TTL is greater than 0, CloudFront will cache content for at least the duration specified in the cache policy's minimum TTL, even if the ``Cache-Control: no-cache``, ``no-store``, or ``private`` directives are present in the origin headers.

  
  

   

  The headers, cookies, and query strings that are included in the cache key are also included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin. CloudFront sends a request when it can't find an object in its cache that matches the request's cache key. If you want to send values to the origin but *not* include them in the cache key, use ``OriginRequestPolicy``.

   

  For more information about cache policies, see `Controlling the cache key <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.

  :type CachePolicyConfig: dict
  :param CachePolicyConfig: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A cache policy configuration.

    

  
    - **Comment** *(string) --* 

      A comment to describe the cache policy. The comment cannot be longer than 128 characters.

      

    
    - **Name** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      A unique name to identify the cache policy.

      

    
    - **DefaultTTL** *(integer) --* 

      The default amount of time, in seconds, that you want objects to stay in the CloudFront cache before CloudFront sends another request to the origin to see if the object has been updated. CloudFront uses this value as the object's time to live (TTL) only when the origin does *not* send ``Cache-Control`` or ``Expires`` headers with the object. For more information, see `Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.

       

      The default value for this field is 86400 seconds (one day). If the value of ``MinTTL`` is more than 86400 seconds, then the default value for this field is the same as the value of ``MinTTL``.

      

    
    - **MaxTTL** *(integer) --* 

      The maximum amount of time, in seconds, that objects stay in the CloudFront cache before CloudFront sends another request to the origin to see if the object has been updated. CloudFront uses this value only when the origin sends ``Cache-Control`` or ``Expires`` headers with the object. For more information, see `Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.

       

      The default value for this field is 31536000 seconds (one year). If the value of ``MinTTL`` or ``DefaultTTL`` is more than 31536000 seconds, then the default value for this field is the same as the value of ``DefaultTTL``.

      

    
    - **MinTTL** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The minimum amount of time, in seconds, that you want objects to stay in the CloudFront cache before CloudFront sends another request to the origin to see if the object has been updated. For more information, see `Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.

      

    
    - **ParametersInCacheKeyAndForwardedToOrigin** *(dict) --* 

      The HTTP headers, cookies, and URL query strings to include in the cache key. The values included in the cache key are also included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin.

      

    
      - **EnableAcceptEncodingGzip** *(boolean) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        A flag that can affect whether the ``Accept-Encoding`` HTTP header is included in the cache key and included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin.

         

        This field is related to the ``EnableAcceptEncodingBrotli`` field. If one or both of these fields is ``true`` *and* the viewer request includes the ``Accept-Encoding`` header, then CloudFront does the following:

         

        
        * Normalizes the value of the viewer's ``Accept-Encoding`` header
         
        * Includes the normalized header in the cache key
         
        * Includes the normalized header in the request to the origin, if a request is necessary
        

         

        For more information, see `Compression support <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-policy-compressed-objects>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.

         

        If you set this value to ``true``, and this cache behavior also has an origin request policy attached, do not include the ``Accept-Encoding`` header in the origin request policy. CloudFront always includes the ``Accept-Encoding`` header in origin requests when the value of this field is ``true``, so including this header in an origin request policy has no effect.

         

        If both of these fields are ``false``, then CloudFront treats the ``Accept-Encoding`` header the same as any other HTTP header in the viewer request. By default, it's not included in the cache key and it's not included in origin requests. In this case, you can manually add ``Accept-Encoding`` to the headers whitelist like any other HTTP header.

        

      
      - **EnableAcceptEncodingBrotli** *(boolean) --* 

        A flag that can affect whether the ``Accept-Encoding`` HTTP header is included in the cache key and included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin.

         

        This field is related to the ``EnableAcceptEncodingGzip`` field. If one or both of these fields is ``true`` *and* the viewer request includes the ``Accept-Encoding`` header, then CloudFront does the following:

         

        
        * Normalizes the value of the viewer's ``Accept-Encoding`` header
         
        * Includes the normalized header in the cache key
         
        * Includes the normalized header in the request to the origin, if a request is necessary
        

         

        For more information, see `Compression support <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-policy-compressed-objects>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.

         

        If you set this value to ``true``, and this cache behavior also has an origin request policy attached, do not include the ``Accept-Encoding`` header in the origin request policy. CloudFront always includes the ``Accept-Encoding`` header in origin requests when the value of this field is ``true``, so including this header in an origin request policy has no effect.

         

        If both of these fields are ``false``, then CloudFront treats the ``Accept-Encoding`` header the same as any other HTTP header in the viewer request. By default, it's not included in the cache key and it's not included in origin requests. In this case, you can manually add ``Accept-Encoding`` to the headers whitelist like any other HTTP header.

        - **CookieBehavior** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          Determines whether any cookies in viewer requests are included in the cache key and in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin. Valid values are:

           

          
          * ``none`` – No cookies in viewer requests are included in the cache key or in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin. Even when this field is set to ``none``, any cookies that are listed in an ``OriginRequestPolicy`` *are* included in origin requests.
           
          * ``whitelist`` – Only the cookies in viewer requests that are listed in the ``CookieNames`` type are included in the cache key and in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin.

        - **QueryStringBehavior** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          Determines whether any URL query strings in viewer requests are included in the cache key and in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin. Valid values are:

           

          
          * ``none`` – No query strings in viewer requests are included in the cache key or in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin. Even when this field is set to ``none``, any query strings that are listed in an ``OriginRequestPolicy`` *are* included in origin requests.

              This field is related to the ``EnableAcceptEncodingBrotli`` field. If one or both of these fields is ``true`` *and* the viewer request includes the ``Accept-Encoding`` header, then CloudFront does the following:

               

              
              * Normalizes the value of the viewer's ``Accept-Encoding`` header
               
              * Includes the normalized header in the cache key
               
              * Includes the normalized header in the request to the origin, if a request is necessary
              

               

              For more information, see `Compression support <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-policy-compressed-objects>`__ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.

               

              If you set this value to ``true``, and this cache behavior also has an origin request policy attached, do not include the ``Accept-Encoding`` header in the origin request policy. CloudFront always includes the ``Accept-Encoding`` header in origin requests when the value of this field is ``true``, so including this header in an origin request policy has no effect.

               

              If both of these fields are ``false``, then CloudFront treats the ``Accept-Encoding`` header the same as any other HTTP header in the viewer request. By default, it's not included in the cache key and it's not included in origin requests. In this case, you can manually add ``Accept-Encoding`` to the headers whitelist like any other HTTP header.

                Contains the specific query strings in viewer requests that either **are** or **are not** included in the cache key and in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin. The behavior depends on whether the ``QueryStringBehavior`` field in the ``CachePolicyQueryStringsConfig`` type is set to ``whitelist`` (the listed query strings **are** included) or ``allExcept`` (the listed query strings **are not** included, but all other query strings are).
