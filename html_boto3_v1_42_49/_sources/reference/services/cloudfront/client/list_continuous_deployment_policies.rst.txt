.. py:method:: CloudFront.Client.list_continuous_deployment_policies(**kwargs)

  

  Gets a list of the continuous deployment policies in your Amazon Web Services account.

   

  You can optionally specify the maximum number of items to receive in the response. If the total number of items in the list exceeds the maximum that you specify, or the default maximum, the response is paginated. To get the next page of items, send a subsequent request that specifies the ``NextMarker`` value from the current response as the ``Marker`` value in the subsequent request.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_continuous_deployment_policies(
        Marker='string',
        MaxItems='string'
    )
    
  :type Marker: string
  :param Marker: 

    Use this field when paginating results to indicate where to begin in your list of continuous deployment policies. The response includes policies in the list that occur after the marker. To get the next page of the list, set this field's value to the value of ``NextMarker`` from the current page's response.

    

  
  :type MaxItems: string
  :param MaxItems: 

    The maximum number of continuous deployment policies that you want returned in the response.

                      Session stickiness provides the ability to define multiple requests from a single viewer as a single session. This prevents the potentially inconsistent experience of sending some of a given user's requests to your staging distribution, while others are sent to your primary distribution. Define the session duration using TTL values.

                        The value must be less than or equal to ``MaximumTTL``.

                        
                      

                      - **MaximumTTL** *(integer) --* 

                        The maximum amount of time to consider requests from the viewer as being part of the same session. Allowed values are 300–3600 seconds (5–60 minutes).

                         

                        The value must be greater than or equal to ``IdleTTL``.

                        
                  
                
                  

                  - **SingleHeaderConfig** *(dict) --* 

                    Determines which HTTP requests are sent to the staging distribution.

                      The request header name that you want CloudFront to send to your staging distribution. The header must contain the prefix ``aws-cf-cd-``.

                      
                    

                    - **Value** *(string) --*

                  - **Type** *(string) --* 

                    The type of traffic configuration.
