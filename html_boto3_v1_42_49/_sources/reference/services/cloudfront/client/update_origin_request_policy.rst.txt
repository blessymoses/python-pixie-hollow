.. py:method:: CloudFront.Client.update_origin_request_policy(**kwargs)

  

  Updates an origin request policy configuration.

   

  When you update an origin request policy configuration, all the fields are updated with the values provided in the request. You cannot update some fields independent of others. To update an origin request policy configuration:

   

   
  * Use ``GetOriginRequestPolicyConfig`` to get the current configuration.
   
  * Locally modify the fields in the origin request policy configuration that you want to update.
   
  * Call ``UpdateOriginRequestPolicy`` by providing the entire origin request policy configuration, including the fields that you modified and those that you didn't.
