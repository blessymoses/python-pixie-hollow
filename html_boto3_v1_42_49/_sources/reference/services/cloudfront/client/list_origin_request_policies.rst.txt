.. py:method:: CloudFront.Client.list_origin_request_policies(**kwargs)

  

  Gets a list of origin request policies.

   

  You can optionally apply a filter to return only the managed policies created by Amazon Web Services, or only the custom policies created in your Amazon Web Services account.

   

  You can optionally specify the maximum number of items to receive in the response. If the total number of items in the list exceeds the maximum that you specify, or the default maximum, the response is paginated. To get the next page of items, send a subsequent request that specifies the ``NextMarker`` value from the current response as the ``Marker`` value in the subsequent request.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_origin_request_policies(
        Type='managed'|'custom',
        Marker='string',
        MaxItems='string'
    )
    
  :type Type: string
  :param Type: 

    A filter to return only the specified kinds of origin request policies. Valid values are:

     

    
    * ``managed`` – Returns only the managed policies created by Amazon Web Services.
     
    * ``custom`` – Returns only the custom policies created in your Amazon Web Services account.
    

    

  
  :type Marker: string
  :param Marker: 

    Use this field when paginating results to indicate where to begin in your list of origin request policies. The response includes origin request policies in the list that occur after the marker. To get the next page of the list, set this field's value to the value of ``NextMarker`` from the current page's response.

    

  
  :type MaxItems: string
  :param MaxItems: 

    The maximum number of origin request policies that you want in the response.
