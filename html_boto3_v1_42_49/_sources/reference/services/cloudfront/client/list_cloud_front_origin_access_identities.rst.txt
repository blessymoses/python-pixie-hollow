  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_cloud_front_origin_access_identities(
        Marker='string',
        MaxItems='string'
    )
    
  :type Marker: string
  :param Marker: 

    Use this when paginating results to indicate where to begin in your list of origin access identities. The results include identities in the list that occur after the marker. To get the next page of results, set the ``Marker`` to the value of the ``NextMarker`` from the current page's response (which is also the ID of the last identity on that page).

    

  
  :type MaxItems: string
  :param MaxItems: 

    The maximum number of origin access identities you want in the response body.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 

      The returned result of the corresponding request.

      
      

      - **CloudFrontOriginAccessIdentityList** *(dict) --* 

        The ``CloudFrontOriginAccessIdentityList`` type.

        
        

        - **Marker** *(string) --* 

          Use this when paginating results to indicate where to begin in your list of origin access identities. The results include identities in the list that occur after the marker. To get the next page of results, set the ``Marker`` to the value of the ``NextMarker`` from the current page's response (which is also the ID of the last identity on that page).

          
        

        - **NextMarker** *(string) --* 

          If ``IsTruncated`` is ``true``, this element is present and contains the value you can use for the ``Marker`` request parameter to continue listing your origin access identities where they left off.

          
        

        - **MaxItems** *(integer) --* 

          The maximum number of origin access identities you want in the response body.

          
        

        - **IsTruncated** *(boolean) --* 

          A flag that indicates whether more origin access identities remain to be listed. If your results were truncated, you can make a follow-up pagination request using the ``Marker`` request parameter to retrieve more items in the list.

          
        

        - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

          The number of CloudFront origin access identities that were created by the current Amazon Web Services account.

          
        

        - **Items** *(list) --* 

          A complex type that contains one ``CloudFrontOriginAccessIdentitySummary`` element for each origin access identity that was created by the current Amazon Web Services account.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            Summary of the information about a CloudFront origin access identity.

            
            

            - **Id** *(string) --* 

              The ID for the origin access identity. For example: ``E74FTE3AJFJ256A``.

              
            

            - **S3CanonicalUserId** *(string) --* 

              The Amazon S3 canonical user ID for the origin access identity, which you use when giving the origin access identity read permission to an object in Amazon S3.

              
            

            - **Comment** *(string) --* 

              The comment for this origin access identity, as originally specified when created.
