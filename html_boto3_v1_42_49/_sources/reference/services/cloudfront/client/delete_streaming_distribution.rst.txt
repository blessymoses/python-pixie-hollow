.. py:method:: CloudFront.Client.delete_streaming_distribution(**kwargs)

  

  Delete a streaming distribution. To delete an RTMP distribution using the CloudFront API, perform the following steps.

   

  **To delete an RTMP distribution using the CloudFront API**:

   

   
  * Disable the RTMP distribution.
   
  * Submit a ``GET Streaming Distribution Config`` request to get the current configuration and the ``Etag`` header for the distribution.
   
  * Update the XML document that was returned in the response to your ``GET Streaming Distribution Config`` request to change the value of ``Enabled`` to ``false``.
   
  * Submit a ``PUT Streaming Distribution Config`` request to update the configuration for your distribution. In the request body, include the XML document that you updated in Step 3. Then set the value of the HTTP ``If-Match`` header to the value of the ``ETag`` header that CloudFront returned when you submitted the ``GET Streaming Distribution Config`` request in Step 2.
   
  * Review the response to the ``PUT Streaming Distribution Config`` request to confirm that the distribution was successfully disabled.
   
  * Submit a ``GET Streaming Distribution Config`` request to confirm that your changes have propagated. When propagation is complete, the value of ``Status`` is ``Deployed``.
   
  * Submit a ``DELETE Streaming Distribution`` request. Set the value of the HTTP ``If-Match`` header to the value of the ``ETag`` header that CloudFront returned when you submitted the ``GET Streaming Distribution Config`` request in Step 2.
   
  * Review the response to your ``DELETE Streaming Distribution`` request to confirm that the distribution was successfully deleted.
