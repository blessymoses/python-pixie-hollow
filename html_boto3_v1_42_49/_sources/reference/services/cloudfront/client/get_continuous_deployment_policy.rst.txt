    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **ContinuousDeploymentPolicy** *(dict) --* 

        A continuous deployment policy.

        
        

        - **Id** *(string) --* 

          The identifier of the continuous deployment policy.

          
        

        - **LastModifiedTime** *(datetime) --* 

          The date and time the continuous deployment policy was last modified.

          
        

        - **ContinuousDeploymentPolicyConfig** *(dict) --* 

          Contains the configuration for a continuous deployment policy.

          
          

          - **StagingDistributionDnsNames** *(dict) --* 

            The CloudFront domain name of the staging distribution. For example: ``d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net``.

            
            

            - **Quantity** *(integer) --* 

              The number of CloudFront domain names in your staging distribution.

              
            

            - **Items** *(list) --* 

              The CloudFront domain name of the staging distribution.

              
              

              - *(string) --* 
          
        
          

          - **Enabled** *(boolean) --* 

            A Boolean that indicates whether this continuous deployment policy is enabled (in effect). When this value is ``true``, this policy is enabled and in effect. When this value is ``false``, this policy is not enabled and has no effect.

            
          

          - **TrafficConfig** *(dict) --* 

            Contains the parameters for routing production traffic from your primary to staging distributions.

            
            

            - **SingleWeightConfig** *(dict) --* 

              Contains the percentage of traffic to send to the staging distribution.

              
              

              - **Weight** *(float) --* 

                The percentage of traffic to send to a staging distribution, expressed as a decimal number between 0 and 0.15. For example, a value of 0.10 means 10% of traffic is sent to the staging distribution.

                
              

              - **SessionStickinessConfig** *(dict) --* 

                Session stickiness provides the ability to define multiple requests from a single viewer as a single session. This prevents the potentially inconsistent experience of sending some of a given user's requests to your staging distribution, while others are sent to your primary distribution. Define the session duration using TTL values.

                
                

                - **IdleTTL** *(integer) --* 

                  The amount of time after which you want sessions to cease if no requests are received. Allowed values are 300–3600 seconds (5–60 minutes).

                   

                  The value must be less than or equal to ``MaximumTTL``.

                  
                

                - **MaximumTTL** *(integer) --* 

                  The maximum amount of time to consider requests from the viewer as being part of the same session. Allowed values are 300–3600 seconds (5–60 minutes).

                   

                  The value must be greater than or equal to ``IdleTTL``.

                  
            
          
            

            - **SingleHeaderConfig** *(dict) --* 

              Determines which HTTP requests are sent to the staging distribution.

              
              

              - **Header** *(string) --* 

                The request header name that you want CloudFront to send to your staging distribution. The header must contain the prefix ``aws-cf-cd-``.

                
              

              - **Value** *(string) --*

      - **ETag** *(string) --* 

        The version identifier for the current version of the continuous deployment policy.
