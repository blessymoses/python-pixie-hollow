    )
    
  :type Name: string
  :param Name: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of the group, which is the identifier of the group in other operations. You can't change the name of a resource group after you create it. A resource group name can consist of letters, numbers, hyphens, periods, and underscores. The name cannot start with ``AWS``, ``aws``, or any other possible capitalization; these are reserved. A resource group name must be unique within each Amazon Web Services Region in your Amazon Web Services account.

    

  
  :type Description: string
  :param Description: 

    The description of the resource group. Descriptions can consist of letters, numbers, hyphens, underscores, periods, and spaces.

    

  
  :type ResourceQuery: dict
  :param ResourceQuery: 

    The resource query that determines which Amazon Web Services resources are members of this group. For more information about resource queries, see `Create a tag-based group in Resource Groups <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/userguide/gettingstarted-query.html#gettingstarted-query-cli-tag>`__.

     

    .. note::

      

      A resource group can contain either a ``ResourceQuery`` or a ``Configuration``, but not both.

      

    

  
    - **Type** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The type of the query to perform. This can have one of two values:

       

      
      * ``CLOUDFORMATION_STACK_1_0:`` Specifies that you want the group to contain the members of an CloudFormation stack. The ``Query`` contains a ``StackIdentifier`` element with an Amazon resource name (ARN) for a CloudFormation stack.
       
      * ``TAG_FILTERS_1_0:`` Specifies that you want the group to include resource that have tags that match the query.
      

      

    
    - **Query** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The query that defines a group or a search. The contents depends on the value of the ``Type`` element.

       

      
      * ``ResourceTypeFilters`` – Applies to all ``ResourceQuery`` objects of either ``Type``. This element contains one of the following two items: 

        
        * The value ``AWS::AllSupported``. This causes the ResourceQuery to match resources of any resource type that also match the query.
         
        * A list (a JSON array) of resource type identifiers that limit the query to only resources of the specified types. For the complete list of resource types that you can use in the array value for ``ResourceTypeFilters``, see `Resources you can use with Resource Groups and Tag Editor <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/userguide/supported-resources.html>`__ in the *Resource Groups User Guide*.
        

       

      Example: ``"ResourceTypeFilters": ["AWS::AllSupported"]`` or ``"ResourceTypeFilters": ["AWS::EC2::Instance", "AWS::S3::Bucket"]``

      
       
      * ``TagFilters`` – applicable only if ``Type`` = ``TAG_FILTERS_1_0``. The ``Query`` contains a JSON string that represents a collection of simple tag filters. The JSON string uses a syntax similar to the ``GetResources`` operation, but uses only the ``ResourceTypeFilters`` and ``TagFilters`` fields. If you specify more than one tag key, only resources that match all tag keys, and at least one value of each specified tag key, are returned in your query. If you specify more than one value for a tag key, a resource matches the filter if it has a tag key value that matches *any* of the specified values. For example, consider the following sample query for resources that have two tags, ``Stage`` and ``Version``, with two values each: ``[{"Stage":["Test","Deploy"]},{"Version":["1","2"]}]`` The results of this resource query could include the following. 

        
        * An Amazon EC2 instance that has the following two tags: ``{"Stage":"Deploy"}``, and ``{"Version":"2"}``
         
        * An S3 bucket that has the following two tags: ``{"Stage":"Test"}``, and ``{"Version":"1"}``
        

       

      The resource query results would *not* include the following items in the results, however.

       

        
        * An Amazon EC2 instance that has only the following tag: ``{"Stage":"Deploy"}``. The instance does not have **all** of the tag keys specified in the filter, so it is excluded from the results.
         
        * An RDS database that has the following two tags: ``{"Stage":"Archived"}`` and ``{"Version":"4"}`` The database has all of the tag keys, but none of those keys has an associated value that matches at least one of the specified values in the filter.
        

       

      Example: ``"TagFilters": [ { "Key": "Stage", "Values": [ "Gamma", "Beta" ] }``

      
       
      * ``StackIdentifier`` – applicable only if ``Type`` = ``CLOUDFORMATION_STACK_1_0``. The value of this parameter is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CloudFormation stack whose resources you want included in the group.
      

      

    
  
  :type Tags: dict
  :param Tags: 

    The tags to add to the group. A tag is key-value pair string.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    
      - *(string) --* 

      


  :type Configuration: list
  :param Configuration: 

    A configuration associates the resource group with an Amazon Web Services service and specifies how the service can interact with the resources in the group. A configuration is an array of  GroupConfigurationItem elements. For details about the syntax of service configurations, see `Service configurations for Resource Groups <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/APIReference/about-slg.html>`__.

     

    .. note::

    - *(dict) --* 

      An item in a group configuration. A group service configuration can have one or more items. For details about group service configuration syntax, see `Service configurations for resource groups <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/APIReference/about-slg.html>`__.

      

    
      - **Type** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        Specifies the type of group configuration item. Each item must have a unique value for ``type``. For the list of types that you can specify for a configuration item, see `Supported resource types and parameters <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/APIReference/about-slg.html#about-slg-types>`__.

        

      
      - **Parameters** *(list) --* 

        A collection of parameters for this group configuration item. For the list of parameters that you can use with each configuration item type, see `Supported resource types and parameters <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/APIReference/about-slg.html#about-slg-types>`__.

        

      
        - *(dict) --* 

          A parameter for a group configuration item. For details about group service configuration syntax, see `Service configurations for resource groups <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/APIReference/about-slg.html>`__.

          

        
          - **Name** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            The name of the group configuration parameter. For the list of parameters that you can use with each configuration item type, see `Supported resource types and parameters <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/APIReference/about-slg.html#about-slg-types>`__.

            

          
          - **Values** *(list) --* 

            The value or values to be used for the specified parameter. For the list of values you can use with each parameter, see `Supported resource types and parameters <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/APIReference/about-slg.html#about-slg-types>`__.

            

          
            - *(string) --*
