      - **Pending** *(list) --* 

        A list of any resources that are still in the process of being removed from the group by this operation. These pending removals continue asynchronously. You can check the status of pending removals by using the ``ListGroupResources`` operation. After the resource is successfully removed, it no longer appears in the response.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          A structure that identifies a resource that is currently pending addition to the group as a member. Adding a resource to a resource group happens asynchronously as a background task and this one isn't completed yet.

          
          

          - **ResourceArn** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon resource name (ARN) of the resource that's in a pending state.
