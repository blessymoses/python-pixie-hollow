.. py:class:: ECR.Client

  A low-level client representing Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)
   

  Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) is a managed container image registry service. Customers can use the familiar Docker CLI, or their preferred client, to push, pull, and manage images. Amazon ECR provides a secure, scalable, and reliable registry for your Docker or Open Container Initiative (OCI) images. Amazon ECR supports private repositories with resource-based permissions using IAM so that specific users or Amazon EC2 instances can access repositories and images.

   

  Amazon ECR has service endpoints in each supported Region. For more information, see `Amazon ECR endpoints <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/ecr.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*.
