.. py:method:: EFS.Client.delete_replication_configuration(**kwargs)

  

  Deletes a replication configuration. Deleting a replication configuration ends the replication process. After a replication configuration is deleted, the destination file system becomes ``Writeable`` and its replication overwrite protection is re-enabled. For more information, see `Delete a replication configuration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/delete-replications.html>`__.

   

  This operation requires permissions for the ``elasticfilesystem:DeleteReplicationConfiguration`` action.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.delete_replication_configuration(
        SourceFileSystemId='string',
        DeletionMode='ALL_CONFIGURATIONS'|'LOCAL_CONFIGURATION_ONLY'
    )
    
  :type SourceFileSystemId: string
  :param SourceFileSystemId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ID of the source file system in the replication configuration.

    

  
  :type DeletionMode: string
  :param DeletionMode: 

    When replicating across Amazon Web Services accounts or across Amazon Web Services Regions, Amazon EFS deletes the replication configuration from both the source and destination account or Region ( ``ALL_CONFIGURATIONS``) by default. If there's a configuration or permissions issue that prevents Amazon EFS from deleting the replication configuration from both sides, you can use the ``LOCAL_CONFIGURATION_ONLY`` mode to delete the replication configuration from only the local side (the account or Region from which the delete is performed).

     

    .. note::

      

      Only use the ``LOCAL_CONFIGURATION_ONLY`` mode in the case that Amazon EFS is unable to delete the replication configuration in both the source and destination account or Region. Deleting the local configuration leaves the configuration in the other account or Region unrecoverable.

       

      Additionally, do not use this mode for same-account, same-region replication as doing so results in a BadRequest exception error.
