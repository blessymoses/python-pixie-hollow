.. py:method:: EFS.Client.describe_file_systems(**kwargs)

  

  Returns the description of a specific Amazon EFS file system if either the file system ``CreationToken`` or the ``FileSystemId`` is provided. Otherwise, it returns descriptions of all file systems owned by the caller's Amazon Web Services account in the Amazon Web Services Region of the endpoint that you're calling.

   

  When retrieving all file system descriptions, you can optionally specify the ``MaxItems`` parameter to limit the number of descriptions in a response. This number is automatically set to 100. If more file system descriptions remain, Amazon EFS returns a ``NextMarker``, an opaque token, in the response. In this case, you should send a subsequent request with the ``Marker`` request parameter set to the value of ``NextMarker``.

   

  To retrieve a list of your file system descriptions, this operation is used in an iterative process, where ``DescribeFileSystems`` is called first without the ``Marker`` and then the operation continues to call it with the ``Marker`` parameter set to the value of the ``NextMarker`` from the previous response until the response has no ``NextMarker``.

   

  The order of file systems returned in the response of one ``DescribeFileSystems`` call and the order of file systems returned across the responses of a multi-call iteration is unspecified.

   

  This operation requires permissions for the ``elasticfilesystem:DescribeFileSystems`` action.

    )
    
  :type MaxItems: integer
  :param MaxItems: 

    (Optional) Specifies the maximum number of file systems to return in the response (integer). This number is automatically set to 100. The response is paginated at 100 per page if you have more than 100 file systems.

    

  
  :type Marker: string
  :param Marker: 

    (Optional) Opaque pagination token returned from a previous ``DescribeFileSystems`` operation (String). If present, specifies to continue the list from where the returning call had left off.

    

  
  :type CreationToken: string
  :param CreationToken: 

    (Optional) Restricts the list to the file system with this creation token (String). You specify a creation token when you create an Amazon EFS file system.

            The ID of the file system, assigned by Amazon EFS.

            
          

          - **FileSystemArn** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the EFS file system, in the format ``arn:aws:elasticfilesystem:region:account-id:file-system/file-system-id ``. Example with sample data: ``arn:aws:elasticfilesystem:us-west-2:1111333322228888:file-system/fs-01234567``

            
          

          - **CreationTime** *(datetime) --* 

            The time that the file system was created, in seconds (since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z).

            The lifecycle phase of the file system.

            
          

          - **Name** *(string) --* 

            You can add tags to a file system, including a ``Name`` tag. For more information, see  CreateFileSystem. If the file system has a ``Name`` tag, Amazon EFS returns the value in this field.

            
          

          - **NumberOfMountTargets** *(integer) --* 

            The current number of mount targets that the file system has. For more information, see  CreateMountTarget.

            
          

          - **SizeInBytes** *(dict) --* 

            The latest known metered size (in bytes) of data stored in the file system, in its ``Value`` field, and the time at which that size was determined in its ``Timestamp`` field. The ``Timestamp`` value is the integer number of seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z. The ``SizeInBytes`` value doesn't represent the size of a consistent snapshot of the file system, but it is eventually consistent when there are no writes to the file system. That is, ``SizeInBytes`` represents actual size only if the file system is not modified for a period longer than a couple of hours. Otherwise, the value is not the exact size that the file system was at any point in time.

            - **ValueInStandard** *(integer) --* 

              The latest known metered size (in bytes) of data stored in the Standard storage class.

              
            

            - **ValueInArchive** *(integer) --* 

              The latest known metered size (in bytes) of data stored in the Archive storage class.

              
        
          

          - **PerformanceMode** *(string) --* 

            The performance mode of the file system.

            Displays the file system's throughput mode. For more information, see `Throughput modes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/performance.html#throughput-modes>`__ in the *Amazon EFS User Guide*.

            
          

          - **ProvisionedThroughputInMibps** *(float) --* 

            The amount of provisioned throughput, measured in MiBps, for the file system. Valid for file systems using ``ThroughputMode`` set to ``provisioned``.

            
          

          - **AvailabilityZoneName** *(string) --* 

            Describes the Amazon Web Services Availability Zone in which the file system is located, and is valid only for One Zone file systems. For more information, see `Using EFS storage classes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/storage-classes.html>`__ in the *Amazon EFS User Guide*.

            
          

          - **AvailabilityZoneId** *(string) --* 

            The unique and consistent identifier of the Availability Zone in which the file system is located, and is valid only for One Zone file systems. For example, ``use1-az1`` is an Availability Zone ID for the us-east-1 Amazon Web Services Region, and it has the same location in every Amazon Web Services account.

            
          

          - **Tags** *(list) --* 

            The tags associated with the file system, presented as an array of ``Tag`` objects.

            
            

            - *(dict) --* 

              A tag is a key-value pair. Allowed characters are letters, white space, and numbers that can be represented in UTF-8, and the following characters: `` + - = . _ : /``.

              
              

              - **Key** *(string) --* 

                The tag key (String). The key can't start with ``aws:``.

            - **ReplicationOverwriteProtection** *(string) --* 

              The status of the file system's replication overwrite protection.

               

              
              * ``ENABLED`` – The file system cannot be used as the destination file system in a replication configuration. The file system is writeable. Replication overwrite protection is ``ENABLED`` by default.
               
              * ``DISABLED`` – The file system can be used as the destination file system in a replication configuration. The file system is read-only and can only be modified by EFS replication.
               
              * ``REPLICATING`` – The file system is being used as the destination file system in a replication configuration. The file system is read-only and is modified only by EFS replication.
              

               

              If the replication configuration is deleted, the file system's replication overwrite protection is re-enabled, the file system becomes writeable.

              
        
      
    
      

      - **NextMarker** *(string) --* 

        Present if there are more file systems than returned in the response (String). You can use the ``NextMarker`` in the subsequent request to fetch the descriptions.

        
  
  **Exceptions**
  
  *   :py:class:`EFS.Client.exceptions.BadRequest`

  
  *   :py:class:`EFS.Client.exceptions.InternalServerError`
