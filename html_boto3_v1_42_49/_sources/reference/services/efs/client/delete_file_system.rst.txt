.. py:method:: EFS.Client.delete_file_system(**kwargs)

  

  Deletes a file system, permanently severing access to its contents. Upon return, the file system no longer exists and you can't access any contents of the deleted file system.

   

  You need to manually delete mount targets attached to a file system before you can delete an EFS file system. This step is performed for you when you use the Amazon Web Services console to delete a file system.

   

  .. note::

    

    You cannot delete a file system that is part of an EFS replication configuration. You need to delete the replication configuration first.

    

   

  You can't delete a file system that is in use. That is, if the file system has any mount targets, you must first delete them. For more information, see  DescribeMountTargets and  DeleteMountTarget.

   

  .. note::

    

    The ``DeleteFileSystem`` call returns while the file system state is still ``deleting``. You can check the file system deletion status by calling the  DescribeFileSystems operation, which returns a list of file systems in your account. If you pass file system ID or creation token for the deleted file system, the  DescribeFileSystems returns a ``404 FileSystemNotFound`` error.

    

   

  This operation requires permissions for the ``elasticfilesystem:DeleteFileSystem`` action.
