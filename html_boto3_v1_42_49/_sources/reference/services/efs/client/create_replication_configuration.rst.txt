.. py:method:: EFS.Client.create_replication_configuration(**kwargs)

  

  Creates a replication conﬁguration to either a new or existing EFS file system. For more information, see `Amazon EFS replication <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/efs-replication.html>`__ in the *Amazon EFS User Guide*. The replication configuration specifies the following:

   

  
  * **Source file system** – The EFS file system that you want to replicate.
   
  * **Destination file system** – The destination file system to which the source file system is replicated. There can only be one destination file system in a replication configuration. 

  .. note::

    A file system can be part of only one replication configuration.

   The destination parameters for the replication configuration depend on whether you are replicating to a new file system or to an existing file system, and if you are replicating across Amazon Web Services accounts. See  DestinationToCreate for more information.
  

   

  This operation requires permissions for the ``elasticfilesystem:CreateReplicationConfiguration`` action. Additionally, other permissions are required depending on how you are replicating file systems. For more information, see `Required permissions for replication <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/efs-replication.html#efs-replication-permissions>`__ in the *Amazon EFS User Guide*.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.create_replication_configuration(
        SourceFileSystemId='string',
        Destinations=[
            {
                'Region': 'string',
                'AvailabilityZoneName': 'string',
                'KmsKeyId': 'string',
                'FileSystemId': 'string',
                'RoleArn': 'string'
            },
        ]
    )
    
  :type SourceFileSystemId: string
  :param SourceFileSystemId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Specifies the Amazon EFS file system that you want to replicate. This file system cannot already be a source or destination file system in another replication configuration.

    

  
  :type Destinations: list
  :param Destinations: **[REQUIRED]** 

    An array of destination configuration objects. Only one destination configuration object is supported.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      Describes the new or existing destination file system for the replication configuration.

       

      
      * If you want to replicate to a new file system, do not specify the File System ID for the destination file system. Amazon EFS creates a new, empty file system. For One Zone storage, specify the Availability Zone to create the file system in. To use an Key Management Service key other than the default KMS key, then specify it. For more information, see `Configuring replication to new Amazon EFS file system <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/create-replication.html>`__ in the *Amazon EFS User Guide*. 

      .. note::

        After the file system is created, you cannot change the KMS key or the performance mode.

      
       
      * If you want to replicate to an existing file system that's in the same account as the source file system, then you need to provide the ID or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the file system to which to replicate. The file system's replication overwrite protection must be disabled. For more information, see `Replicating to an existing file system <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/efs-replication#replicate-existing-destination>`__ in the *Amazon EFS User Guide*.
       
      * If you are replicating the file system to a file system that's in a different account than the source file system (cross-account replication), you need to provide the ARN for the file system and the IAM role that allows Amazon EFS to perform replication on the destination account. The file system's replication overwrite protection must be disabled. For more information, see `Replicating across Amazon Web Services accounts <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/cross-account-replication.html>`__ in the *Amazon EFS User Guide*.
      

      

    
      - **Region** *(string) --* 

        To create a file system that uses Regional storage, specify the Amazon Web Services Region in which to create the destination file system. The Region must be enabled for the Amazon Web Services account that owns the source file system. For more information, see `Managing Amazon Web Services Regions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande-manage.html#rande-manage-enable>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference Reference Guide*.

        

      
      - **AvailabilityZoneName** *(string) --* 

        To create a file system that uses One Zone storage, specify the name of the Availability Zone in which to create the destination file system.

        

      
      - **KmsKeyId** *(string) --* 

        Specify the Key Management Service (KMS) key that you want to use to encrypt the destination file system. If you do not specify a KMS key, Amazon EFS uses your default KMS key for Amazon EFS, ``/aws/elasticfilesystem``. This ID can be in one of the following formats:

         

        
        * Key ID - The unique identifier of the key, for example ``1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab``.
         
        * ARN - The ARN for the key, for example ``arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab``.
         
        * Key alias - A previously created display name for a key, for example ``alias/projectKey1``.
         
        * Key alias ARN - The ARN for a key alias, for example ``arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:444455556666:alias/projectKey1``.
        

        

      
      - **FileSystemId** *(string) --* 

        The ID or ARN of the file system to use for the destination. For cross-account replication, this must be an ARN. The file system's replication overwrite replication must be disabled. If no ID or ARN is specified, then a new file system is created.

         

        .. note::

          

          When you initially configure replication to an existing file system, Amazon EFS writes data to or removes existing data from the destination file system to match data in the source file system. If you don't want to change data in the destination file system, then you should replicate to a new file system instead. For more information, see `https\://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/create-replication.html <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/create-replication.html>`__.

          

        

      
      - **RoleArn** *(string) --* 

        Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role in the source account that allows Amazon EFS to perform replication on its behalf. This is optional for same-account replication and required for cross-account replication.
