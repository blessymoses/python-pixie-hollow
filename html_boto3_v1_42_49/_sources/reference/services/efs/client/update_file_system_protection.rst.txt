  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.update_file_system_protection(
        FileSystemId='string',
        ReplicationOverwriteProtection='ENABLED'|'DISABLED'|'REPLICATING'
    )
    
  :type FileSystemId: string
  :param FileSystemId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ID of the file system to update.

    

  
  :type ReplicationOverwriteProtection: string
  :param ReplicationOverwriteProtection: 

    The status of the file system's replication overwrite protection.

     

    
    * ``ENABLED`` – The file system cannot be used as the destination file system in a replication configuration. The file system is writeable. Replication overwrite protection is ``ENABLED`` by default.
     
    * ``DISABLED`` – The file system can be used as the destination file system in a replication configuration. The file system is read-only and can only be modified by EFS replication.
     
    * ``REPLICATING`` – The file system is being used as the destination file system in a replication configuration. The file system is read-only and is only modified only by EFS replication.
    

     

    If the replication configuration is deleted, the file system's replication overwrite protection is re-enabled and the file system becomes writeable.
