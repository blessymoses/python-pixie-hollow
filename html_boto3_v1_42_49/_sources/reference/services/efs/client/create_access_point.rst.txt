.. py:method:: EFS.Client.create_access_point(**kwargs)

  

  Creates an EFS access point. An access point is an application-specific view into an EFS file system that applies an operating system user and group, and a file system path, to any file system request made through the access point. The operating system user and group override any identity information provided by the NFS client. The file system path is exposed as the access point's root directory. Applications using the access point can only access data in the application's own directory and any subdirectories. A file system can have a maximum of 10,000 access points unless you request an increase. To learn more, see `Mounting a file system using EFS access points <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/efs-access-points.html>`__.

   

  .. note::

    

    If multiple requests to create access points on the same file system are sent in quick succession, and the file system is near the limit of access points, you may experience a throttling response for these requests. This is to ensure that the file system does not exceed the stated access point limit.

    

   

  This operation requires permissions for the ``elasticfilesystem:CreateAccessPoint`` action.

   

  Access points can be tagged on creation. If tags are specified in the creation action, IAM performs additional authorization on the ``elasticfilesystem:TagResource`` action to verify if users have permissions to create tags. Therefore, you must grant explicit permissions to use the ``elasticfilesystem:TagResource`` action. For more information, see `Granting permissions to tag resources during creation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/using-tags-efs.html#supported-iam-actions-tagging.html>`__.

        }
    )
    
  :type ClientToken: string
  :param ClientToken: **[REQUIRED]** 

    A string of up to 64 ASCII characters that Amazon EFS uses to ensure idempotent creation.

    This field is autopopulated if not provided.

  
  :type Tags: list
  :param Tags: 

    Creates tags associated with the access point. Each tag is a key-value pair, each key must be unique. For more information, see `Tagging Amazon Web Services resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html>`__ in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference Guide*.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      A tag is a key-value pair. Allowed characters are letters, white space, and numbers that can be represented in UTF-8, and the following characters: `` + - = . _ : /``.

      

    
      - **Key** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The tag key (String). The key can't start with ``aws:``.

        

      
      - **Value** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        The value of the tag key.

        

      
    

  :type FileSystemId: string
  :param FileSystemId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ID of the EFS file system that the access point provides access to.

    

  
  :type PosixUser: dict
  :param PosixUser: 

    The operating system user and group applied to all file system requests made using the access point.

    

  
    - **Uid** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The POSIX user ID used for all file system operations using this access point.

      

    
    - **Gid** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The POSIX group ID used for all file system operations using this access point.

      

    
    - **SecondaryGids** *(list) --* 

      Secondary POSIX group IDs used for all file system operations using this access point.

      

    
      - *(integer) --* 

      
  
  
  :type RootDirectory: dict
  :param RootDirectory: 

    Specifies the directory on the EFS file system that the access point exposes as the root directory of your file system to NFS clients using the access point. The clients using the access point can only access the root directory and below. If the ``RootDirectory`` > ``Path`` specified does not exist, Amazon EFS creates it and applies the ``CreationInfo`` settings when a client connects to an access point. When specifying a ``RootDirectory``, you must provide the ``Path``, and the ``CreationInfo``.

     

    Amazon EFS creates a root directory only if you have provided the CreationInfo: OwnUid, OwnGID, and permissions for the directory. If you do not provide this information, Amazon EFS does not create the root directory. If the root directory does not exist, attempts to mount using the access point will fail.

    

  
    - **Path** *(string) --* 

      Specifies the path on the EFS file system to expose as the root directory to NFS clients using the access point to access the EFS file system. A path can have up to four subdirectories. If the specified path does not exist, you are required to provide the ``CreationInfo``.

      

    
    - **CreationInfo** *(dict) --* 

      (Optional) Specifies the POSIX IDs and permissions to apply to the access point's ``RootDirectory``. If the ``RootDirectory`` > ``Path`` specified does not exist, EFS creates the root directory using the ``CreationInfo`` settings when a client connects to an access point. When specifying the ``CreationInfo``, you must provide values for all properties.

       

      .. warning::

         

        If you do not provide ``CreationInfo`` and the specified ``RootDirectory`` > ``Path`` does not exist, attempts to mount the file system using the access point will fail.

        

      

    
      - **OwnerUid** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        Specifies the POSIX user ID to apply to the ``RootDirectory``. Accepts values from 0 to 2^32 (4294967295).

        

      
      - **OwnerGid** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        Specifies the POSIX group ID to apply to the ``RootDirectory``. Accepts values from 0 to 2^32 (4294967295).

        

      
      - **Permissions** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        Specifies the POSIX permissions to apply to the ``RootDirectory``, in the format of an octal number representing the file's mode bits.
