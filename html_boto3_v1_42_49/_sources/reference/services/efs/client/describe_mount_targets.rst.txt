.. py:method:: EFS.Client.describe_mount_targets(**kwargs)

  

  Returns the descriptions of all the current mount targets, or a specific mount target, for a file system. When requesting all of the current mount targets, the order of mount targets returned in the response is unspecified.

   

  This operation requires permissions for the ``elasticfilesystem:DescribeMountTargets`` action, on either the file system ID that you specify in ``FileSystemId``, or on the file system of the mount target that you specify in ``MountTargetId``.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.describe_mount_targets(
        MaxItems=123,
        Marker='string',
        FileSystemId='string',
        MountTargetId='string',
        AccessPointId='string'
    )
    
  :type MaxItems: integer
  :param MaxItems: 

    (Optional) Maximum number of mount targets to return in the response. Currently, this number is automatically set to 10, and other values are ignored. The response is paginated at 100 per page if you have more than 100 mount targets.

    

  
  :type Marker: string
  :param Marker: 

    (Optional) Opaque pagination token returned from a previous ``DescribeMountTargets`` operation (String). If present, it specifies to continue the list from where the previous returning call left off.

    

  
  :type FileSystemId: string
  :param FileSystemId: 

    (Optional) ID of the file system whose mount targets you want to list (String). It must be included in your request if an ``AccessPointId`` or ``MountTargetId`` is not included. Accepts either a file system ID or ARN as input.

    

  
  :type MountTargetId: string
  :param MountTargetId: 

    (Optional) ID of the mount target that you want to have described (String). It must be included in your request if ``FileSystemId`` is not included. Accepts either a mount target ID or ARN as input.

    

  
  :type AccessPointId: string
  :param AccessPointId: 

    (Optional) The ID of the access point whose mount targets that you want to list. It must be included in your request if a ``FileSystemId`` or ``MountTargetId`` is not included in your request. Accepts either an access point ID or ARN as input.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **Marker** *(string) --* 

        If the request included the ``Marker``, the response returns that value in this field.

        
      

      - **MountTargets** *(list) --* 

        Returns the file system's mount targets as an array of ``MountTargetDescription`` objects.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          Provides a description of a mount target.

          
          

          - **OwnerId** *(string) --* 

            Amazon Web Services account ID that owns the resource.

            
          

          - **MountTargetId** *(string) --* 

            System-assigned mount target ID.

            
          

          - **FileSystemId** *(string) --* 

            The ID of the file system for which the mount target is intended.

            
          

          - **SubnetId** *(string) --* 

            The ID of the mount target's subnet.

            
          

          - **LifeCycleState** *(string) --* 

            Lifecycle state of the mount target.

            
          

          - **IpAddress** *(string) --* 

            Address at which the file system can be mounted by using the mount target.

            
          

          - **Ipv6Address** *(string) --* 

            The IPv6 address for the mount target.

            
          

          - **NetworkInterfaceId** *(string) --* 

            The ID of the network interface that Amazon EFS created when it created the mount target.

            
          

          - **AvailabilityZoneId** *(string) --* 

            The unique and consistent identifier of the Availability Zone that the mount target resides in. For example, ``use1-az1`` is an AZ ID for the us-east-1 Region and it has the same location in every Amazon Web Services account.

            
          

          - **AvailabilityZoneName** *(string) --* 

            The name of the Availability Zone in which the mount target is located. Availability Zones are independently mapped to names for each Amazon Web Services account. For example, the Availability Zone ``us-east-1a`` for your Amazon Web Services account might not be the same location as ``us-east-1a`` for another Amazon Web Services account.
