.. py:method:: Connect.Client.delete_user(**kwargs)

  

  Deletes a user account from the specified Amazon Connect instance.

   

  For information about what happens to a user's data when their account is deleted, see `Delete Users from Your Amazon Connect Instance <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/delete-users.html>`__ in the *Amazon Connect Administrator Guide*.

   

  .. warning::

     

    After calling DeleteUser, call `DeleteQuickConnect <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteQuickConnect.html>`__ to delete any records related to the deleted users. This will help you:

     

    
    * Avoid dangling resources that impact your service quotas.
     
    * Remove deleted users so they don't appear to agents as transfer options.
     
    * Avoid the disruption of other Amazon Connect processes, such as instance replication and syncing if you're using `Amazon Connect Global Resiliency <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/setup-connect-global-resiliency.html>`__.
