.. py:method:: Connect.Client.disassociate_email_address_alias(**kwargs)

  

  Removes the alias association between two email addresses in an Amazon Connect instance. After disassociation, emails sent to the former alias email address are no longer forwarded to the primary email address. Both email addresses continue to exist independently and can receive emails directly.

   

  **Use cases**

   

  Following are common uses cases for this API:

   

  
  * **Department separation**: Remove alias relationships when splitting a consolidated support queue back into separate department-specific queues.
   
  * **Email address retirement**: Cleanly remove forwarding relationships before decommissioning old email addresses.
   
  * **Organizational restructuring**: Reconfigure email routing when business processes change and aliases are no longer needed.
  

   

  **Important things to know**

   

  
  * Concurrent operations: This API uses distributed locking, so concurrent operations on the same email addresses may be temporarily blocked.
   
  * Emails sent to the former alias address are still delivered directly to that address if it exists.
   
  * You do not need to delete the email addresses after disassociation. Both addresses remain active independently.
   
  * After a successful disassociation, you can immediately create a new alias relationship with the same addresses.
   
  * 200 status means alias was successfully disassociated.
  

   

  ``DisassociateEmailAddressAlias`` does not return the following information:

   

  
  * Details in the response about the email that was disassociated. The response returns an empty body.
   
  * The timestamp of when the disassociation occurred.
