.. py:method:: Connect.Client.stop_contact_recording(**kwargs)

  

  Stops recording a call when a contact is being recorded. StopContactRecording is a one-time action. If you use StopContactRecording to stop recording an ongoing call, you can't use StartContactRecording to restart it. For scenarios where the recording has started and you want to suspend it for sensitive information (for example, to collect a credit card number), and then restart it, use SuspendContactRecording and ResumeContactRecording.

   

  Only voice recordings are supported at this time.
