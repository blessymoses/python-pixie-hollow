.. py:method:: Connect.Client.update_contact_attributes(**kwargs)

  

  Creates or updates user-defined contact attributes associated with the specified contact.

   

  You can create or update user-defined attributes for both ongoing and completed contacts. For example, while the call is active, you can update the customer's name or the reason the customer called. You can add notes about steps that the agent took during the call that display to the next agent that takes the call. You can also update attributes for a contact using data from your CRM application and save the data with the contact in Amazon Connect. You could also flag calls for additional analysis, such as legal review or to identify abusive callers.

   

  Contact attributes are available in Amazon Connect for 24 months, and are then deleted. For information about contact record retention and the maximum size of the contact record attributes section, see `Feature specifications <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/amazon-connect-service-limits.html#feature-limits>`__ in the *Amazon Connect Administrator Guide*.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.update_contact_attributes(
        InitialContactId='string',
        InstanceId='string',
        Attributes={
            'string': 'string'
        }
    )
    
  :type InitialContactId: string
  :param InitialContactId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The identifier of the contact. This is the identifier of the contact associated with the first interaction with the contact center.

    

  
  :type InstanceId: string
  :param InstanceId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The identifier of the Amazon Connect instance. You can `find the instance ID <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/find-instance-arn.html>`__ in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the instance.

    

  
  :type Attributes: dict
  :param Attributes: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The Amazon Connect attributes. These attributes can be accessed in flows just like any other contact attributes.

     

    You can have up to 32,768 UTF-8 bytes across all attributes for a contact. Attribute keys can include only alphanumeric, dash, and underscore characters.

     

    In the `Set contact attributes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/set-contact-attributes.html>`__ block, when the attributes for a contact exceed 32 KB, the contact is routed down the Error branch of the flow. As a mitigation, consider the following options:

     

    
    * Remove unnecessary attributes by setting their values to empty.
     
    * If the attributes are only used in one flow and don't need to be referred to outside of that flow (for example, by a Lambda or another flow), then use flow attributes. This way you aren't needlessly persisting the 32 KB of information from one flow to another. For more information, see `Flow block\: Set contact attributes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/set-contact-attributes.html>`__ in the *Amazon Connect Administrator Guide*.
