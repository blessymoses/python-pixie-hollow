.. py:method:: Connect.Client.associate_email_address_alias(**kwargs)

  

  Associates an email address alias with an existing email address in an Amazon Connect instance. This creates a forwarding relationship where emails sent to the alias email address are automatically forwarded to the primary email address.

   

  **Use cases**

   

  Following are common uses cases for this API:

   

  
  * **Unified customer support**: Create multiple entry points (for example, support@example.com, help@example.com, customercare@example.com) that all forward to a single agent queue for streamlined management.
   
  * **Department consolidation**: Forward emails from legacy department addresses (for example, sales@example.com, info@example.com) to a centralized customer service email during organizational restructuring.
   
  * **Brand management**: Enable you to use familiar brand-specific email addresses that forward to the appropriate Amazon Connect instance email address.
  

   

  **Important things to know**

   

  
  * Each email address can have a maximum of one alias. You cannot create multiple aliases for the same email address.
   
  * If the alias email address already receives direct emails, it continues to receive direct emails plus forwarded emails.
   
  * You cannot chain email aliases together (that is, create an alias of an alias).
  

   

  ``AssociateEmailAddressAlias`` does not return the following information:

   

  
  * A confirmation of the alias relationship details (you must call `DescribeEmailAddress <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeEmailAddress.html>`__ to verify).
   
  * The timestamp of when the association occurred.
   
  * The status of the forwarding configuration.
  

   

  **Endpoints**: See `Amazon Connect endpoints and quotas <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/connect_region.html>`__.
