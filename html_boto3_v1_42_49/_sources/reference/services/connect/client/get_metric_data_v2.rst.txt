******************



.. py:method:: Connect.Client.get_metric_data_v2(**kwargs)

  

  Gets metric data from the specified Amazon Connect instance.

   

  ``GetMetricDataV2`` offers more features than `GetMetricData <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_GetMetricData.html>`__, the previous version of this API. It has new metrics, offers filtering at a metric level, and offers the ability to filter and group data by channels, queues, routing profiles, agents, and agent hierarchy levels. It can retrieve historical data for the last 3 months, at varying intervals. It does not support agent queues.

   

  For a description of the historical metrics that are supported by ``GetMetricDataV2`` and ``GetMetricData``, see `Metrics definitions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/metrics-definitions.html>`__ in the *Amazon Connect Administrator Guide*.

   

  .. note::

    

    When you make a successful API request, you can expect the following metric values in the response:

     

    
    * **Metric value is null**: The calculation cannot be performed due to divide by zero or insufficient data
     
    * **Metric value is a number (including 0) of defined type**: The number provided is the calculation result
     
    * **MetricResult list is empty**: The request cannot find any data in the system
    

     

    The following guidelines can help you work with the API:

     

    
    * Each dimension in the metric response must contain a value
     
    * Each item in MetricResult must include all requested metrics
     
    * If the response is slow due to large result sets, try these approaches: 

      
      * Narrow the time range of your request
       
      * Add filters to reduce the amount of data returned

  :type ResourceArn: string
  :param ResourceArn: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource. This includes the ``instanceId`` an Amazon Connect instance.

    

  
  :type StartTime: datetime
  :param StartTime: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The timestamp, in UNIX Epoch time format, at which to start the reporting interval for the retrieval of historical metrics data. The time must be before the end time timestamp. The start and end time depends on the ``IntervalPeriod`` selected. By default the time range between start and end time is 35 days. Historical metrics are available for 3 months.

    

  
  :type EndTime: datetime
  :param EndTime: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The timestamp, in UNIX Epoch time format, at which to end the reporting interval for the retrieval of historical metrics data. The time must be later than the start time timestamp. It cannot be later than the current timestamp.

    

  
  :type Interval: dict
  :param Interval: 

    The interval period and timezone to apply to returned metrics.

     

    
    * ``IntervalPeriod``: An aggregated grouping applied to request metrics. Valid ``IntervalPeriod`` values are: ``FIFTEEN_MIN`` | ``THIRTY_MIN`` | ``HOUR`` | ``DAY`` | ``WEEK`` | ``TOTAL``. For example, if ``IntervalPeriod`` is selected ``THIRTY_MIN``, ``StartTime`` and ``EndTime`` differs by 1 day, then Amazon Connect returns 48 results in the response. Each result is aggregated by the THIRTY_MIN period. By default Amazon Connect aggregates results based on the ``TOTAL`` interval period. The following list describes restrictions on ``StartTime`` and ``EndTime`` based on which ``IntervalPeriod`` is requested. 

      
      * ``FIFTEEN_MIN``: The difference between ``StartTime`` and ``EndTime`` must be less than 3 days.
       
      * ``THIRTY_MIN``: The difference between ``StartTime`` and ``EndTime`` must be less than 3 days.

    * **Filter values**: A maximum of 100 filter values are supported in a single request. VOICE, CHAT, and TASK are valid ``filterValue`` for the CHANNEL filter key. They do not count towards limitation of 100 filter values. For example, a GetMetricDataV2 request can filter by 50 queues, 35 agents, and 15 routing profiles for a total of 100 filter values, along with 3 channel filters. ``contact_lens_conversational_analytics`` is a valid filterValue for the ``FEATURE`` filter key. It is available only to contacts analyzed by Contact Lens conversational analytics. ``connect:Chat``, ``connect:SMS``, ``connect:Telephony``, and ``connect:WebRTC`` are valid ``filterValue`` examples (not exhaustive) for the ``contact/segmentAttributes/connect:Subtype filter`` key. ``ROUTING_STEP_EXPRESSION`` is a valid filter key with a filter value up to 3000 length. This filter is case and order sensitive. JSON string fields must be sorted in ascending order and JSON array order should be kept as is. ``Q_CONNECT_ENABLED``. TRUE and FALSE are the only valid filterValues for the ``Q_CONNECT_ENABLED`` filter key. 

      
      * TRUE includes all contacts that had Connect AI Agents enabled as part of the flow.
       
      * FALSE includes all contacts that did not have Connect AI Agents enabled as part of the flow
       
      * EXPERIENCE_VALIDATION and FLOW_VALIDATION are the only valid filterValues for the contact/segmentAttributes/connect:ValidationTestType filter key
      

     

    This filter is available only for contact record-driven metrics.

     

    `Campaign <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_connect-outbound-campaigns_Campaign.html>`__ ARNs are valid ``filterValues`` for the ``CAMPAIGN`` filter key.

      Contains the filter to apply when retrieving metrics with the `GetMetricDataV2 <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_GetMetricDataV2.html>`__ API.

      

    
      - **FilterKey** *(string) --* 

        The key to use for filtering data. For example, ``QUEUE``, ``ROUTING_PROFILE, AGENT``, ``CHANNEL``, ``AGENT_HIERARCHY_LEVEL_ONE``, ``AGENT_HIERARCHY_LEVEL_TWO``, ``AGENT_HIERARCHY_LEVEL_THREE``, ``AGENT_HIERARCHY_LEVEL_FOUR``, ``AGENT_HIERARCHY_LEVEL_FIVE``. There must be at least 1 key and a maximum 5 keys.

        

      
      - **FilterValues** *(list) --* 

        The identifiers to use for filtering data. For example, if you have a filter key of ``QUEUE``, you would add queue IDs or ARNs in ``FilterValues``.

        

      
        - *(string) --* 

        
    
      - **StringCondition** *(dict) --* 

        System defined filtering condition. For example, the NOT_EXISTS StringCondition returns documents where the field specified by FilterKey does not exist in the document.

         

        When the NOT_EXISTS StringCondition is added to a FilterV2 object, FilterValues must be null or empty.

        

      
        - **Comparison** *(string) --* 

          The string condition.

          

        
      
    

  :type Groupings: list
  :param Groupings: 

    The grouping applied to the metrics that are returned. For example, when results are grouped by queue, the metrics returned are grouped by queue. The values that are returned apply to the metrics for each queue. They are not aggregated for all queues.

     

    If no grouping is specified, a summary of all metrics is returned.

     

    Valid grouping keys: ``AGENT`` | ``AGENT_HIERARCHY_LEVEL_ONE`` | ``AGENT_HIERARCHY_LEVEL_TWO`` | ``AGENT_HIERARCHY_LEVEL_THREE`` | ``AGENT_HIERARCHY_LEVEL_FOUR`` | ``AGENT_HIERARCHY_LEVEL_FIVE`` | ``ANSWERING_MACHINE_DETECTION_STATUS`` | ``BOT_ID`` | ``BOT_ALIAS`` | ``BOT_VERSION`` | ``BOT_LOCALE`` | ``BOT_INTENT_NAME`` | ``CAMPAIGN`` | ``CAMPAIGN_DELIVERY_EVENT_TYPE`` | ``CAMPAIGN_EXCLUDED_EVENT_TYPE`` | ``CAMPAIGN_EXECUTION_TIMESTAMP`` | ``CASE_TEMPLATE_ARN`` | ``CASE_STATUS`` | ``CHANNEL`` | ``contact/segmentAttributes/connect:Subtype`` | ``DISCONNECT_REASON`` | ``EVALUATION_FORM`` | ``EVALUATION_SECTION`` | ``EVALUATION_QUESTION`` | ``EVALUATION_SOURCE`` | ``EVALUATOR_ID`` | ``FLOWS_RESOURCE_ID`` | ``FLOWS_MODULE_RESOURCE_ID`` | ``FLOW_ACTION_ID`` | ``FLOW_TYPE`` | ``FLOWS_OUTCOME_TYPE`` | ``FORM_VERSION`` | ``INITIATION_METHOD`` | ``INVOKING_RESOURCE_PUBLISHED_TIMESTAMP`` | ``INVOKING_RESOURCE_TYPE`` | ``PARENT_FLOWS_RESOURCE_ID`` | ``Q_CONNECT_ENABLED`` | ``QUEUE`` | ``RESOURCE_PUBLISHED_TIMESTAMP`` | ``ROUTING_PROFILE`` | ``ROUTING_STEP_EXPRESSION`` | ``TEST_CASE`` | ``TEST_CASE_EXECUTION_FAILURE_REASON`` | ``TEST_CASE_INVOCATION_METHOD``
