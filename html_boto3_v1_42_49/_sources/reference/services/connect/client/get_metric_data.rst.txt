.. py:method:: Connect.Client.get_metric_data(**kwargs)

  

  Gets historical metric data from the specified Amazon Connect instance.

   

  For a description of each historical metric, see `Metrics definitions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/metrics-definitions.html>`__ in the *Amazon Connect Administrator Guide*.

   

  .. note::

    

    We recommend using the `GetMetricDataV2 <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_GetMetricDataV2.html>`__ API. It provides more flexibility, features, and the ability to query longer time ranges than ``GetMetricData``. Use it to retrieve historical agent and contact metrics for the last 3 months, at varying intervals. You can also use it to build custom dashboards to measure historical queue and agent performance. For example, you can track the number of incoming contacts for the last 7 days, with data split by day, to see how contact volume changed per day of the week.

  :type InstanceId: string
  :param InstanceId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The identifier of the Amazon Connect instance. You can `find the instance ID <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/find-instance-arn.html>`__ in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the instance.

    

  
  :type StartTime: datetime
  :param StartTime: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The timestamp, in UNIX Epoch time format, at which to start the reporting interval for the retrieval of historical metrics data. The time must be specified using a multiple of 5 minutes, such as 10:05, 10:10, 10:15.

     

    The start time cannot be earlier than 24 hours before the time of the request. Historical metrics are available only for 24 hours.

    

  
  :type EndTime: datetime
  :param EndTime: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The timestamp, in UNIX Epoch time format, at which to end the reporting interval for the retrieval of historical metrics data. The time must be specified using an interval of 5 minutes, such as 11:00, 11:05, 11:10, and must be later than the start time timestamp.

     

    The time range between the start and end time must be less than 24 hours.

    

  
  :type Filters: dict
  :param Filters: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The queues, up to 100, or channels, to use to filter the metrics returned. Metric data is retrieved only for the resources associated with the queues or channels included in the filter. You can include both queue IDs and queue ARNs in the same request. VOICE, CHAT, and TASK channels are supported.

     

    RoutingStepExpression is not a valid filter for GetMetricData and we recommend switching to GetMetricDataV2 for more up-to-date features.

     

    .. note::

      

      To filter by ``Queues``, enter the queue ID/ARN, not the name of the queue.

      

    

  
    - **Queues** *(list) --* 

      The queues to use to filter the metrics. You should specify at least one queue, and can specify up to 100 queues per request. The ``GetCurrentMetricsData`` API in particular requires a queue when you include a ``Filter`` in your request.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    - **Channels** *(list) --* 

      The channel to use to filter the metrics.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    - **RoutingProfiles** *(list) --* 

      A list of up to 100 routing profile IDs or ARNs.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    - **RoutingStepExpressions** *(list) --* 

      A list of expressions as a filter, in which an expression is an object of a step in a routing criteria.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    - **AgentStatuses** *(list) --* 

      A list of up to 50 agent status IDs or ARNs.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    - **Subtypes** *(list) --* 

      A list of up to 10 subtypes can be provided.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
    - **ValidationTestTypes** *(list) --* 

      A list of up to 10 validationTestTypes can be provided.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
  
  
  :type Groupings: list
  :param Groupings: 

    The grouping applied to the metrics returned. For example, when results are grouped by queue, the metrics returned are grouped by queue. The values returned apply to the metrics for each queue rather than aggregated for all queues.

     

    If no grouping is specified, a summary of metrics for all queues is returned.

     

    RoutingStepExpression is not a valid filter for GetMetricData and we recommend switching to GetMetricDataV2 for more up-to-date features.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type HistoricalMetrics: list
  :param HistoricalMetrics: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The metrics to retrieve. Specify the name, unit, and statistic for each metric. The following historical metrics are available. For a description of each metric, see `Metrics definition <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/metrics-definitions.html>`__ in the *Amazon Connect Administrator Guide*.

     

    .. note::

      

      This API does not support a contacts incoming metric (there's no CONTACTS_INCOMING metric missing from the documented list).
