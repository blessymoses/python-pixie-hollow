  :type InstanceId: string

    The identifier of the Amazon Connect instance.

    

  
  :type HoursOfOperationId: string
  :param HoursOfOperationId: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The identifier for the hours of operation

    

  
  :type Name: string
  :param Name: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of the hours of operation override.

    

  
  :type Description: string
  :param Description: 

    The description of the hours of operation override.

    

  
  :type Config: list
  :param Config: **[REQUIRED]** 

    Configuration information for the hours of operation override: day, start time, and end time.

    

  
    - *(dict) --* 

      Information about the hours of operation override config: day, start time, and end time.

      

    
      - **Day** *(string) --* 

        The day that the hours of operation override applies to.

        

      
      - **StartTime** *(dict) --* 

        The start time when your contact center opens if overrides are applied.

        

      
        - **Hours** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The hours.

          

        
        - **Minutes** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The minutes.

          

        
      
      - **EndTime** *(dict) --* 

        The end time that your contact center closes if overrides are applied.

        

      
        - **Hours** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The hours.

          

        
        - **Minutes** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

          The minutes.

          

        
      
    

  :type EffectiveFrom: string

    The date from when the hours of operation override is effective.

    

  
  :type EffectiveTill: string
  :param EffectiveTill: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The date until when the hours of operation override is effective.

    

  
  :type RecurrenceConfig: dict
  :param RecurrenceConfig: 

    Configuration for a recurring event.

    

  
    - **RecurrencePattern** *(dict) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

      The recurrence pattern that defines how the event repeats. Example: Frequency, Interval, ByMonth, ByMonthDay, ByWeekdayOccurrence

      

    
      - **Frequency** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        Defines how often the pattern repeats. This is the base unit for the recurrence schedule and works in conjunction with the Interval field to determine the exact repetition sequence.

        

      
      - **Interval** *(integer) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

        Specifies the number of frequency units between each occurrence. Must be a positive integer.

         

        Examples: To repeat every week, set Interval=1 with WEEKLY frequency. To repeat every two months, set Interval=2 with MONTHLY frequency.

        

      
      - **ByMonth** *(list) --* 

        Specifies which month the event should occur in (1-12, where 1=January, 12=December). Used with YEARLY frequency to schedule events in specific month.

         

        Note: It does not accept multiple values in the same list

        

      
        - *(integer) --* 

        
    
      - **ByMonthDay** *(list) --* 

        Specifies which day of the month the event should occur on (1-31). Used with MONTHLY or YEARLY frequency to schedule events on specific date within a month.

         

        Examples: [15] for events on the 15th of each month, [-1] for events on the last day of month.

         

        Note: It does not accept multiple values in the same list. If a specified day doesn't exist in a particular month (e.g., day 31 in February), the event will be skipped for that month. This field cannot be used simultaneously with ByWeekdayOccurrence as they represent different scheduling approaches (specific dates vs. relative weekday positions).

        

      
        - *(integer) --* 

        
    
      - **ByWeekdayOccurrence** *(list) --* 

        Specifies which occurrence of a weekday within the month the event should occur on. Must be used with MONTHLY or YEARLY frequency.

         

        Example: 2 corresponds to second occurrence of the weekday in the month. -1 corresponds to last occurrence of the weekday in the month

         

        The weekday itself is specified separately in the HoursOfOperationConfig. Example: To schedule the recurring event for the 2nd Thursday of April every year, set ByWeekdayOccurrence=[2], Day=THURSDAY, ByMonth=[4], Frequency: YEARLY and INTERVAL=1.

        

      
        - *(integer) --* 

        
    
    
  
  :type OverrideType: string
  :param OverrideType: 

    Whether the override will be defined as a *standard* or as a *recurring event*.

     

    For more information about how override types are applied, see `Build your list of overrides <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https:/docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/hours-of-operation-overrides.html>`__ in the *Administrator Guide*.
