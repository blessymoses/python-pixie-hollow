.. py:method:: Connect.Client.start_task_contact(**kwargs)

  

  Initiates a flow to start a new task contact. For more information about task contacts, see `Concepts\: Tasks in Amazon Connect <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/tasks.html>`__ in the *Amazon Connect Administrator Guide*.

   

  When using ``PreviousContactId`` and ``RelatedContactId`` input parameters, note the following:

   

  
  * ``PreviousContactId`` 

    
    * Any updates to user-defined task contact attributes on any contact linked through the same ``PreviousContactId`` will affect every contact in the chain.
     
    * There can be a maximum of 12 linked task contacts in a chain. That is, 12 task contacts can be created that share the same ``PreviousContactId``.
    

  
   
  * ``RelatedContactId`` 

    
    * Copies contact attributes from the related task contact to the new contact.
     
    * Any update on attributes in a new task contact does not update attributes on previous contact.
     
    * There’s no limit on the number of task contacts that can be created that use the same ``RelatedContactId``.
    

  
  

   

  In addition, when calling StartTaskContact include only one of these parameters: ``ContactFlowID``, ``QuickConnectID``, or ``TaskTemplateID``. Only one parameter is required as long as the task template has a flow configured to run it. If more than one parameter is specified, or only the ``TaskTemplateID`` is specified but it does not have a flow configured, the request returns an error because Amazon Connect cannot identify the unique flow to run when the task is created.

   

  A ``ServiceQuotaExceededException`` occurs when the number of open tasks exceeds the active tasks quota or there are already 12 tasks referencing the same ``PreviousContactId``. For more information about service quotas for task contacts, see `Amazon Connect service quotas <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/amazon-connect-service-limits.html>`__ in the *Amazon Connect Administrator Guide*.

  :param ContactFlowId: 

    The identifier of the flow for initiating the tasks. To see the ContactFlowId in the Amazon Connect admin website, on the navigation menu go to **Routing**, **Flows**. Choose the flow.

    - *(string) --*

  :type ClientToken: string
  :param ClientToken: 

    A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency of the request. If not provided, the Amazon Web Services SDK populates this field. For more information about idempotency, see `Making retries safe with idempotent APIs <https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/making-retries-safe-with-idempotent-APIs/>`__.

    This field is autopopulated if not provided.

  
  :type ScheduledTime: datetime

  :param TaskTemplateId: 

    A unique identifier for the task template. For more information about task templates, see `Create task templates <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/task-templates.html>`__ in the *Amazon Connect Administrator Guide*.

    

  
  :type QuickConnectId: string

    The contactId that is `related <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/tasks.html#linked-tasks>`__ to this contact. Linking tasks together by using ``RelatedContactID`` copies over contact attributes from the related task contact to the new task contact. All updates to user-defined attributes in the new task contact are limited to the individual contact ID, unlike what happens when tasks are linked by using ``PreviousContactID``. There are no limits to the number of contacts that can be linked by using ``RelatedContactId``.

    This field can be used to set Contact Expiry as a duration in minutes and set a UserId for the User who created a task.

     

    .. note::

      

      To set contact expiry, a ValueMap must be specified containing the integer number of minutes the contact will be active for before expiring, with ``SegmentAttributes`` like { ``"connect:ContactExpiry": {"ValueMap" : { "ExpiryDuration": { "ValueInteger": 135}}}}``.
