.. py:method:: Connect.Client.suspend_contact_recording(**kwargs)

  

  When a contact is being recorded, this API suspends recording whatever is selected in the flow configuration: call (IVR or agent), screen, or both. If only call recording or only screen recording is enabled, then it would be suspended. For example, you might suspend the screen recording while collecting sensitive information, such as a credit card number. Then use `ResumeContactRecording <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_ResumeContactRecording.html>`__ to restart recording the screen.

   

  The period of time that the recording is suspended is filled with silence in the final recording.

   

  Voice (IVR, agent) and screen recordings are supported.
