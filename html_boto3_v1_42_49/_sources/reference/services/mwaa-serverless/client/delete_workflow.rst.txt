.. py:method:: MWAAServerless.Client.delete_workflow(**kwargs)

  

  Deletes a workflow and all its versions. This operation permanently removes the workflow and cannot be undone. Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow Serverless ensures that all associated resources are properly cleaned up, including stopping any running executions, removing scheduled triggers, and cleaning up execution history. The deletion process respects the multi-tenant isolation boundaries and ensures that no residual data or configurations remain that could affect other customers or workflows.
