.. py:method:: ChimeSDKVoice.Client.create_voice_connector_group(**kwargs)

  

  Creates an Amazon Chime SDK Voice Connector group under the administrator's AWS account. You can associate Amazon Chime SDK Voice Connectors with the Voice Connector group by including ``VoiceConnectorItems`` in the request.

   

  You can include Voice Connectors from different AWS Regions in your group. This creates a fault tolerant mechanism for fallback in case of availability events.
