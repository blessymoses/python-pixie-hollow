  .. note::

    

    If you are using the Amazon CodeCatalyst APIs with an SDK or the CLI, you must configure your computer to work with Amazon CodeCatalyst and single sign-on (SSO). For more information, see `Setting up to use the CLI with Amazon CodeCatalyst <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecatalyst/latest/userguide/set-up-cli.html>`__ and the SSO documentation for your SDK.
