.. py:method:: Lambda.Client.create_function(**kwargs)

  

  Creates a Lambda function. To create a function, you need a `deployment package <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-package.html>`__ and an `execution role <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/intro-permission-model.html#lambda-intro-execution-role>`__. The deployment package is a .zip file archive or container image that contains your function code. The execution role grants the function permission to use Amazon Web Services services, such as Amazon CloudWatch Logs for log streaming and X-Ray for request tracing.

   

  If the deployment package is a `container image <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-images.html>`__, then you set the package type to ``Image``. For a container image, the code property must include the URI of a container image in the Amazon ECR registry. You do not need to specify the handler and runtime properties.

   

  If the deployment package is a `.zip file archive <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-package.html#gettingstarted-package-zip>`__, then you set the package type to ``Zip``. For a .zip file archive, the code property specifies the location of the .zip file. You must also specify the handler and runtime properties. The code in the deployment package must be compatible with the target instruction set architecture of the function ( ``x86-64`` or ``arm64``). If you do not specify the architecture, then the default value is ``x86-64``.

   

  When you create a function, Lambda provisions an instance of the function and its supporting resources. If your function connects to a VPC, this process can take a minute or so. During this time, you can't invoke or modify the function. The ``State``, ``StateReason``, and ``StateReasonCode`` fields in the response from  GetFunctionConfiguration indicate when the function is ready to invoke. For more information, see `Lambda function states <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/functions-states.html>`__.

   

  A function has an unpublished version, and can have published versions and aliases. The unpublished version changes when you update your function's code and configuration. A published version is a snapshot of your function code and configuration that can't be changed. An alias is a named resource that maps to a version, and can be changed to map to a different version. Use the ``Publish`` parameter to create version ``1`` of your function from its initial configuration.

   

  The other parameters let you configure version-specific and function-level settings. You can modify version-specific settings later with  UpdateFunctionConfiguration. Function-level settings apply to both the unpublished and published versions of the function, and include tags (  TagResource) and per-function concurrency limits (  PutFunctionConcurrency).

   

  You can use code signing if your deployment package is a .zip file archive. To enable code signing for this function, specify the ARN of a code-signing configuration. When a user attempts to deploy a code package with  UpdateFunctionCode, Lambda checks that the code package has a valid signature from a trusted publisher. The code-signing configuration includes set of signing profiles, which define the trusted publishers for this function.

   

  If another Amazon Web Services account or an Amazon Web Services service invokes your function, use  AddPermission to grant permission by creating a resource-based Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy. You can grant permissions at the function level, on a version, or on an alias.

   

  To invoke your function directly, use  Invoke. To invoke your function in response to events in other Amazon Web Services services, create an event source mapping (  CreateEventSourceMapping), or configure a function trigger in the other service. For more information, see `Invoking Lambda functions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-invocation.html>`__.

          The format in which Lambda sends your function's application and system logs to CloudWatch. Select between plain text and structured JSON.

          
        

        - **ApplicationLogLevel** *(string) --* 

          Set this property to filter the application logs for your function that Lambda sends to CloudWatch. Lambda only sends application logs at the selected level of detail and lower, where ``TRACE`` is the highest level and ``FATAL`` is the lowest.

          
        

        - **SystemLogLevel** *(string) --* 

          Set this property to filter the system logs for your function that Lambda sends to CloudWatch. Lambda only sends system logs at the selected level of detail and lower, where ``DEBUG`` is the highest level and ``WARN`` is the lowest.

          
        

        - **LogGroup** *(string) --* 

          The name of the Amazon CloudWatch log group the function sends logs to. By default, Lambda functions send logs to a default log group named ``/aws/lambda/<function name>``. To use a different log group, enter an existing log group or enter a new log group name.

          
    
      

      - **CapacityProviderConfig** *(dict) --* 

        Configuration for the capacity provider that manages compute resources for Lambda functions.

        
        

        - **LambdaManagedInstancesCapacityProviderConfig** *(dict) --* 

          Configuration for Lambda-managed instances used by the capacity provider.

          
          

          - **CapacityProviderArn** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the capacity provider.

            
          

          - **PerExecutionEnvironmentMaxConcurrency** *(integer) --* 

            The maximum number of concurrent execution environments that can run on each compute instance.

            
          

          - **ExecutionEnvironmentMemoryGiBPerVCpu** *(float) --* 

            The amount of memory in GiB allocated per vCPU for execution environments.

            
      
    
      

      - **ConfigSha256** *(string) --* 

        The SHA256 hash of the function configuration.

        
      

      - **DurableConfig** *(dict) --* 

        The function's durable execution configuration settings, if the function is configured for durability.

        
        

        - **RetentionPeriodInDays** *(integer) --* 

          The number of days to retain execution history after a durable execution completes. After this period, execution history is no longer available through the GetDurableExecutionHistory API.

          
        

        - **ExecutionTimeout** *(integer) --* 

          The maximum time (in seconds) that a durable execution can run before timing out. This timeout applies to the entire durable execution, not individual function invocations.

          
    
      

      - **TenancyConfig** *(dict) --* 

        The function's tenant isolation configuration settings. Determines whether the Lambda function runs on a shared or dedicated infrastructure per unique tenant.

        
        

        - **TenantIsolationMode** *(string) --* 

          Tenant isolation mode allows for invocation to be sent to a corresponding execution environment dedicated to a specific tenant ID.

  **Examples**

  The following example creates a function with a deployment package in Amazon S3 and enables X-Ray tracing and environment variable encryption.
  ::

    response = client.create_function(
        Code={
            'S3Bucket': 'my-bucket-1xpuxmplzrlbh',
            'S3Key': 'function.zip',
        },
        Description='Process image objects from Amazon S3.',
        Environment={
            'Variables': {
