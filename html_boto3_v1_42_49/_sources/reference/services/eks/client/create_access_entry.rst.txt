.. py:method:: EKS.Client.create_access_entry(**kwargs)

  

  Creates an access entry.

   

  An access entry allows an IAM principal to access your cluster. Access entries can replace the need to maintain entries in the ``aws-auth`` ``ConfigMap`` for authentication. You have the following options for authorizing an IAM principal to access Kubernetes objects on your cluster: Kubernetes role-based access control (RBAC), Amazon EKS, or both. Kubernetes RBAC authorization requires you to create and manage Kubernetes ``Role``, ``ClusterRole``, ``RoleBinding``, and ``ClusterRoleBinding`` objects, in addition to managing access entries. If you use Amazon EKS authorization exclusively, you don't need to create and manage Kubernetes ``Role``, ``ClusterRole``, ``RoleBinding``, and ``ClusterRoleBinding`` objects.

   

  For more information about access entries, see `Access entries <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/access-entries.html>`__ in the *Amazon EKS User Guide*.

  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.create_access_entry(
        clusterName='string',
        principalArn='string',
        kubernetesGroups=[
            'string',
        ],
        tags={
            'string': 'string'
        },
        clientRequestToken='string',
        username='string',
        type='string'
    )
    
  :type clusterName: string
  :param clusterName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of your cluster.

    

  
  :type principalArn: string
  :param principalArn: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The ARN of the IAM principal for the ``AccessEntry``. You can specify one ARN for each access entry. You can't specify the same ARN in more than one access entry. This value can't be changed after access entry creation.

     

    The valid principals differ depending on the type of the access entry in the ``type`` field. For ``STANDARD`` access entries, you can use every IAM principal type. For nodes ( ``EC2`` (for EKS Auto Mode), ``EC2_LINUX``, ``EC2_WINDOWS``, ``FARGATE_LINUX``, and ``HYBRID_LINUX``), the only valid ARN is IAM roles. You can't use the STS session principal type with access entries because this is a temporary principal for each session and not a permanent identity that can be assigned permissions.

     

    `IAM best practices <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#bp-users-federation-idp>`__ recommend using IAM roles with temporary credentials, rather than IAM users with long-term credentials.

    

  
  :type kubernetesGroups: list
  :param kubernetesGroups: 

    The value for ``name`` that you've specified for ``kind: Group`` as a ``subject`` in a Kubernetes ``RoleBinding`` or ``ClusterRoleBinding`` object. Amazon EKS doesn't confirm that the value for ``name`` exists in any bindings on your cluster. You can specify one or more names.

     

    Kubernetes authorizes the ``principalArn`` of the access entry to access any cluster objects that you've specified in a Kubernetes ``Role`` or ``ClusterRole`` object that is also specified in a binding's ``roleRef``. For more information about creating Kubernetes ``RoleBinding``, ``ClusterRoleBinding``, ``Role``, or ``ClusterRole`` objects, see `Using RBAC Authorization in the Kubernetes documentation <https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/>`__.

     

    If you want Amazon EKS to authorize the ``principalArn`` (instead of, or in addition to Kubernetes authorizing the ``principalArn``), you can associate one or more access policies to the access entry using ``AssociateAccessPolicy``. If you associate any access policies, the ``principalARN`` has all permissions assigned in the associated access policies and all permissions in any Kubernetes ``Role`` or ``ClusterRole`` objects that the group names are bound to.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

    

  :type tags: dict
  :param tags: 

    Metadata that assists with categorization and organization. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value. You define both. Tags don't propagate to any other cluster or Amazon Web Services resources.

    

  
    - *(string) --* 

      One part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A ``key`` is a general label that acts like a category for more specific tag values.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

        The optional part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A ``value`` acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

        

      


  :type clientRequestToken: string
  :param clientRequestToken: 

    A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency of the request.

    This field is autopopulated if not provided.

  
  :type username: string
  :param username: 

    The username to authenticate to Kubernetes with. We recommend not specifying a username and letting Amazon EKS specify it for you. For more information about the value Amazon EKS specifies for you, or constraints before specifying your own username, see `Creating access entries <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/access-entries.html#creating-access-entries>`__ in the *Amazon EKS User Guide*.

    

  
  :type type: string
  :param type: 

    The type of the new access entry. Valid values are ``STANDARD``, ``FARGATE_LINUX``, ``EC2_LINUX``, ``EC2_WINDOWS``, ``EC2`` (for EKS Auto Mode), ``HYBRID_LINUX``, and ``HYPERPOD_LINUX``.

     

    If the ``principalArn`` is for an IAM role that's used for self-managed Amazon EC2 nodes, specify ``EC2_LINUX`` or ``EC2_WINDOWS``. Amazon EKS grants the necessary permissions to the node for you. If the ``principalArn`` is for any other purpose, specify ``STANDARD``. If you don't specify a value, Amazon EKS sets the value to ``STANDARD``. If you have the access mode of the cluster set to ``API_AND_CONFIG_MAP``, it's unnecessary to create access entries for IAM roles used with Fargate profiles or managed Amazon EC2 nodes, because Amazon EKS creates entries in the ``aws-auth`` ``ConfigMap`` for the roles. You can't change this value once you've created the access entry.

     

    If you set the value to ``EC2_LINUX`` or ``EC2_WINDOWS``, you can't specify values for ``kubernetesGroups``, or associate an ``AccessPolicy`` to the access entry.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **accessEntry** *(dict) --* 

        An access entry allows an IAM principal (user or role) to access your cluster. Access entries can replace the need to maintain the ``aws-auth`` ``ConfigMap`` for authentication. For more information about access entries, see `Access entries <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/access-entries.html>`__ in the *Amazon EKS User Guide*.

        
        

        - **clusterName** *(string) --* 

          The name of your cluster.

          
        

        - **principalArn** *(string) --* 

          The ARN of the IAM principal for the access entry. If you ever delete the IAM principal with this ARN, the access entry isn't automatically deleted. We recommend that you delete the access entry with an ARN for an IAM principal that you delete. If you don't delete the access entry and ever recreate the IAM principal, even if it has the same ARN, the access entry won't work. This is because even though the ARN is the same for the recreated IAM principal, the ``roleID`` or ``userID`` (you can see this with the Security Token Service ``GetCallerIdentity`` API) is different for the recreated IAM principal than it was for the original IAM principal. Even though you don't see the IAM principal's ``roleID`` or ``userID`` for an access entry, Amazon EKS stores it with the access entry.

          
        

        - **kubernetesGroups** *(list) --* 

          A ``name`` that you've specified in a Kubernetes ``RoleBinding`` or ``ClusterRoleBinding`` object so that Kubernetes authorizes the ``principalARN`` access to cluster objects.

          
          

          - *(string) --* 
      
        

        - **accessEntryArn** *(string) --* 

          The ARN of the access entry.

          
        

        - **createdAt** *(datetime) --* 

          The Unix epoch timestamp at object creation.

          
        

        - **modifiedAt** *(datetime) --* 

          The Unix epoch timestamp for the last modification to the object.

          
        

        - **tags** *(dict) --* 

          Metadata that assists with categorization and organization. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value. You define both. Tags don't propagate to any other cluster or Amazon Web Services resources.

          
          

          - *(string) --* 

            One part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A ``key`` is a general label that acts like a category for more specific tag values.

            
            

            - *(string) --* 

              The optional part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A ``value`` acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

              
      
    
        

        - **username** *(string) --* 

          The ``name`` of a user that can authenticate to your cluster.
