  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_access_entries(
        clusterName='string',
        associatedPolicyArn='string',
        maxResults=123,
        nextToken='string'
    )
    
  :type clusterName: string
  :param clusterName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of your cluster.

    

  
  :type associatedPolicyArn: string
  :param associatedPolicyArn: 

    The ARN of an ``AccessPolicy``. When you specify an access policy ARN, only the access entries associated to that access policy are returned. For a list of available policy ARNs, use ``ListAccessPolicies``.

    

  
  :type maxResults: integer
  :param maxResults: 

    The maximum number of results, returned in paginated output. You receive ``maxResults`` in a single page, along with a ``nextToken`` response element. You can see the remaining results of the initial request by sending another request with the returned ``nextToken`` value. This value can be between 1 and 100. If you don't use this parameter, 100 results and a ``nextToken`` value, if applicable, are returned.

    

  
  :type nextToken: string
  :param nextToken: 

    The ``nextToken`` value returned from a previous paginated request, where ``maxResults`` was used and the results exceeded the value of that parameter. Pagination continues from the end of the previous results that returned the ``nextToken`` value. This value is null when there are no more results to return.

     

    .. note::

      

      This token should be treated as an opaque identifier that is used only to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other programmatic purposes.
