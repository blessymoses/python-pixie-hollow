  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_clusters(
        maxResults=123,
        nextToken='string',
        include=[
            'string',
        ]
    )
    
  :type maxResults: integer
  :param maxResults: 

    The maximum number of results, returned in paginated output. You receive ``maxResults`` in a single page, along with a ``nextToken`` response element. You can see the remaining results of the initial request by sending another request with the returned ``nextToken`` value. This value can be between 1 and 100. If you don't use this parameter, 100 results and a ``nextToken`` value, if applicable, are returned.

    

  
  :type nextToken: string
  :param nextToken: 

    The ``nextToken`` value returned from a previous paginated request, where ``maxResults`` was used and the results exceeded the value of that parameter. Pagination continues from the end of the previous results that returned the ``nextToken`` value. This value is null when there are no more results to return.

     

    .. note::

      

      This token should be treated as an opaque identifier that is used only to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other programmatic purposes.

      

    

  
  :type include: list
  :param include: 

    Indicates whether external clusters are included in the returned list. Use ' ``all``' to return `https\://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eks-connector.html <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eks-connector.html>`__connected clusters, or blank to return only Amazon EKS clusters. ' ``all``' must be in lowercase otherwise an error occurs.
