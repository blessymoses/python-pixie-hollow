  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_updates(
        name='string',
        nodegroupName='string',
        addonName='string',
        capabilityName='string',
        nextToken='string',
        maxResults=123
    )
    
  :type name: string
  :param name: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of the Amazon EKS cluster to list updates for.

    

  
  :type nodegroupName: string
  :param nodegroupName: 

    The name of the Amazon EKS managed node group to list updates for.

    

  
  :type addonName: string
  :param addonName: 

    The names of the installed add-ons that have available updates.

    

  
  :type capabilityName: string
  :param capabilityName: 

    The name of the capability for which you want to list updates.

    

  
  :type nextToken: string
  :param nextToken: 

    The ``nextToken`` value returned from a previous paginated request, where ``maxResults`` was used and the results exceeded the value of that parameter. Pagination continues from the end of the previous results that returned the ``nextToken`` value. This value is null when there are no more results to return.

     

    .. note::

      

      This token should be treated as an opaque identifier that is used only to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other programmatic purposes.

      

    

  
  :type maxResults: integer
  :param maxResults: 

    The maximum number of results, returned in paginated output. You receive ``maxResults`` in a single page, along with a ``nextToken`` response element. You can see the remaining results of the initial request by sending another request with the returned ``nextToken`` value. This value can be between 1 and 100. If you don't use this parameter, 100 results and a ``nextToken`` value, if applicable, are returned.
