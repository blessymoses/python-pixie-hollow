.. py:method:: EKS.Client.list_pod_identity_associations(**kwargs)

  

  List the EKS Pod Identity associations in a cluster. You can filter the list by the namespace that the association is in or the service account that the association uses.

  

  See also: `AWS API Documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/eks-2017-11-01/ListPodIdentityAssociations>`_  


  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_pod_identity_associations(
        clusterName='string',
        namespace='string',
        serviceAccount='string',
        maxResults=123,
        nextToken='string'
    )
    
  :type clusterName: string
  :param clusterName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of the cluster that the associations are in.

    

  
  :type namespace: string
  :param namespace: 

    The name of the Kubernetes namespace inside the cluster that the associations are in.

    

  
  :type serviceAccount: string
  :param serviceAccount: 

    The name of the Kubernetes service account that the associations use.

    

  
  :type maxResults: integer
  :param maxResults: 

    The maximum number of EKS Pod Identity association results returned by ``ListPodIdentityAssociations`` in paginated output. When you use this parameter, ``ListPodIdentityAssociations`` returns only ``maxResults`` results in a single page along with a ``nextToken`` response element. You can see the remaining results of the initial request by sending another ``ListPodIdentityAssociations`` request with the returned ``nextToken`` value. This value can be between 1 and 100. If you don't use this parameter, ``ListPodIdentityAssociations`` returns up to 100 results and a ``nextToken`` value if applicable.

    

  
  :type nextToken: string
  :param nextToken: 

    The ``nextToken`` value returned from a previous paginated ``ListUpdates`` request where ``maxResults`` was used and the results exceeded the value of that parameter. Pagination continues from the end of the previous results that returned the ``nextToken`` value.

     

    .. note::

      

      This token should be treated as an opaque identifier that is used only to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other programmatic purposes.

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **associations** *(list) --* 

        The list of summarized descriptions of the associations that are in the cluster and match any filters that you provided.

         

        Each summary is simplified by removing these fields compared to the full `PodIdentityAssociation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/APIReference/API_PodIdentityAssociation.html>`__:

         

        
        * The IAM role: ``roleArn``
         
        * The timestamp that the association was created at: ``createdAt``
         
        * The most recent timestamp that the association was modified at:. ``modifiedAt``
         
        * The tags on the association: ``tags``
        

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          The summarized description of the association.

            The name of the cluster that the association is in.

            
          

          - **namespace** *(string) --* 

            The name of the Kubernetes namespace inside the cluster to create the association in. The service account and the Pods that use the service account must be in this namespace.

            
          

          - **serviceAccount** *(string) --* 

            The name of the Kubernetes service account inside the cluster to associate the IAM credentials with.

            
          

          - **associationArn** *(string) --*

          - **associationId** *(string) --* 

            The ID of the association.

            
          

          - **ownerArn** *(string) --* 

            If defined, the association is owned by an Amazon EKS add-on.

            
      
    
      

      - **nextToken** *(string) --* 

        The ``nextToken`` value to include in a future ``ListPodIdentityAssociations`` request. When the results of a ``ListPodIdentityAssociations`` request exceed ``maxResults``, you can use this value to retrieve the next page of results. This value is ``null`` when there are no more results to return.
