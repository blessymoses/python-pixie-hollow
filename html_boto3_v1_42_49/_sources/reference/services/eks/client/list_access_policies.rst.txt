  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_access_policies(
        maxResults=123,
        nextToken='string'
    )
    
  :type maxResults: integer
  :param maxResults: 

    The maximum number of results, returned in paginated output. You receive ``maxResults`` in a single page, along with a ``nextToken`` response element. You can see the remaining results of the initial request by sending another request with the returned ``nextToken`` value. This value can be between 1 and 100. If you don't use this parameter, 100 results and a ``nextToken`` value, if applicable, are returned.

    

  
  :type nextToken: string
  :param nextToken: 

    The ``nextToken`` value returned from a previous paginated request, where ``maxResults`` was used and the results exceeded the value of that parameter. Pagination continues from the end of the previous results that returned the ``nextToken`` value. This value is null when there are no more results to return.

     

    .. note::

      

      This token should be treated as an opaque identifier that is used only to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other programmatic purposes.

    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **accessPolicies** *(list) --* 

        The list of available access policies. You can't view the contents of an access policy using the API. To view the contents, see `Access policy permissions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/access-policies.html#access-policy-permissions>`__ in the *Amazon EKS User Guide*.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          An access policy includes permissions that allow Amazon EKS to authorize an IAM principal to work with Kubernetes objects on your cluster. The policies are managed by Amazon EKS, but they're not IAM policies. You can't view the permissions in the policies using the API. The permissions for many of the policies are similar to the Kubernetes ``cluster-admin``, ``admin``, ``edit``, and ``view`` cluster roles. For more information about these cluster roles, see `User-facing roles <https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#user-facing-roles>`__ in the Kubernetes documentation. To view the contents of the policies, see `Access policy permissions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/access-policies.html#access-policy-permissions>`__ in the *Amazon EKS User Guide*.

          
          

          - **name** *(string) --* 

            The name of the access policy.

            
          

          - **arn** *(string) --* 

            The ARN of the access policy.

            
      
    
      

      - **nextToken** *(string) --* 

        The ``nextToken`` value returned from a previous paginated request, where ``maxResults`` was used and the results exceeded the value of that parameter. Pagination continues from the end of the previous results that returned the ``nextToken`` value. This value is null when there are no more results to return.
