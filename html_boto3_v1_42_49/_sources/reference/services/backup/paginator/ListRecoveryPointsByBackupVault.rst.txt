              - **MoveToColdStorageAt** *(datetime) --* 

                A timestamp that specifies when to transition a recovery point to cold storage.

                
              

              - **DeleteAt** *(datetime) --* 

                A timestamp that specifies when to delete a recovery point.

                
          
            

            - **Lifecycle** *(dict) --* 

              The lifecycle defines when a protected resource is transitioned to cold storage and when it expires. Backup transitions and expires backups automatically according to the lifecycle that you define.

               

              Backups transitioned to cold storage must be stored in cold storage for a minimum of 90 days. Therefore, the “retention” setting must be 90 days greater than the “transition to cold after days” setting. The “transition to cold after days” setting cannot be changed after a backup has been transitioned to cold.

               

              Resource types that can transition to cold storage are listed in the `Feature availability by resource <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/backup-feature-availability.html#features-by-resource>`__ table. Backup ignores this expression for other resource types.

              - **DeleteAfterDays** *(integer) --* 

                The number of days after creation that a recovery point is deleted. This value must be at least 90 days after the number of days specified in ``MoveToColdStorageAfterDays``.

                
              

              - **OptInToArchiveForSupportedResources** *(boolean) --* 

                If the value is true, your backup plan transitions supported resources to archive (cold) storage tier in accordance with your lifecycle settings.

                
              

              - **DeleteAfterEvent** *(string) --* 

                The event after which a recovery point is deleted. A recovery point with both ``DeleteAfterDays`` and ``DeleteAfterEvent`` will delete after whichever condition is satisfied first. Not valid as an input.

                
          
            

            - **EncryptionKeyArn** *(string) --*

            - **IsEncrypted** *(boolean) --* 

              A Boolean value that is returned as ``TRUE`` if the specified recovery point is encrypted, or ``FALSE`` if the recovery point is not encrypted.

              
            

            - **LastRestoreTime** *(datetime) --* 

              The date and time a recovery point was last restored, in Unix format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of ``LastRestoreTime`` is accurate to milliseconds. For example, the value 1516925490.087 represents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.

              
            

            - **ParentRecoveryPointArn** *(string) --*
