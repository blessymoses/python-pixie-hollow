    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **BackupPlan** *(dict) --* 

        Specifies the body of a backup plan. Includes a ``BackupPlanName`` and one or more sets of ``Rules``.

        
        

        - **BackupPlanName** *(string) --* 

          The display name of a backup plan. Must contain only alphanumeric or '-_.' special characters.

           

          If this is set in the console, it can contain 1 to 50 characters; if this is set through CLI or API, it can contain 1 to 200 characters.

          
        

        - **Rules** *(list) --* 

          An array of ``BackupRule`` objects, each of which specifies a scheduled task that is used to back up a selection of resources.

          
          

          - *(dict) --* 

            Specifies a scheduled task used to back up a selection of resources.

            
            

            - **RuleName** *(string) --* 

              A display name for a backup rule. Must contain 1 to 50 alphanumeric or '-_.' characters.

              
            

            - **TargetBackupVaultName** *(string) --* 

              The name of a logical container where backups are stored. Backup vaults are identified by names that are unique to the account used to create them and the Amazon Web Services Region where they are created.

              
            

            - **TargetLogicallyAirGappedBackupVaultArn** *(string) --* 

              The ARN of a logically air-gapped vault. ARN must be in the same account and Region. If provided, supported fully managed resources back up directly to logically air-gapped vault, while other supported resources create a temporary (billable) snapshot in backup vault, then copy it to logically air-gapped vault. Unsupported resources only back up to the specified backup vault.

              
            

            - **ScheduleExpression** *(string) --* 

              A cron expression in UTC specifying when Backup initiates a backup job. When no CRON expression is provided, Backup will use the default expression ``cron(0 5 ? * * *)``.

               

              For more information about Amazon Web Services cron expressions, see `Schedule Expressions for Rules <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/ScheduledEvents.html>`__ in the *Amazon CloudWatch Events User Guide*.

               

              Two examples of Amazon Web Services cron expressions are ``15 * ? * * *`` (take a backup every hour at 15 minutes past the hour) and ``0 12 * * ? *`` (take a backup every day at 12 noon UTC).

               

              For a table of examples, click the preceding link and scroll down the page.

              
            

            - **StartWindowMinutes** *(integer) --* 

              A value in minutes after a backup is scheduled before a job will be canceled if it doesn't start successfully. This value is optional. If this value is included, it must be at least 60 minutes to avoid errors.

               

              During the start window, the backup job status remains in ``CREATED`` status until it has successfully begun or until the start window time has run out. If within the start window time Backup receives an error that allows the job to be retried, Backup will automatically retry to begin the job at least every 10 minutes until the backup successfully begins (the job status changes to ``RUNNING``) or until the job status changes to ``EXPIRED`` (which is expected to occur when the start window time is over).

              
            

            - **CompletionWindowMinutes** *(integer) --* 

              A value in minutes after a backup job is successfully started before it must be completed or it will be canceled by Backup. This value is optional.

              
            

            - **Lifecycle** *(dict) --* 

              The lifecycle defines when a protected resource is transitioned to cold storage and when it expires. Backup transitions and expires backups automatically according to the lifecycle that you define.

               

              Backups transitioned to cold storage must be stored in cold storage for a minimum of 90 days. Therefore, the “retention” setting must be 90 days greater than the “transition to cold after days” setting. The “transition to cold after days” setting cannot be changed after a backup has been transitioned to cold.

               

              Resource types that can transition to cold storage are listed in the `Feature availability by resource <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/backup-feature-availability.html#features-by-resource>`__ table. Backup ignores this expression for other resource types.

              
              

              - **MoveToColdStorageAfterDays** *(integer) --* 

                The number of days after creation that a recovery point is moved to cold storage.

                
              

              - **DeleteAfterDays** *(integer) --* 

                The number of days after creation that a recovery point is deleted. This value must be at least 90 days after the number of days specified in ``MoveToColdStorageAfterDays``.

                
              

              - **OptInToArchiveForSupportedResources** *(boolean) --* 

                If the value is true, your backup plan transitions supported resources to archive (cold) storage tier in accordance with your lifecycle settings.

                
              

              - **DeleteAfterEvent** *(string) --* 

                The event after which a recovery point is deleted. A recovery point with both ``DeleteAfterDays`` and ``DeleteAfterEvent`` will delete after whichever condition is satisfied first. Not valid as an input.

                
          
            

            - **RecoveryPointTags** *(dict) --* 

              The tags that are assigned to resources that are associated with this rule when restored from backup.

              
              

              - *(string) --*

            - **RuleId** *(string) --* 

              Uniquely identifies a rule that is used to schedule the backup of a selection of resources.

              
            

            - **CopyActions** *(list) --* 

              An array of ``CopyAction`` objects, which contains the details of the copy operation.

              
              

              - *(dict) --* 

                The details of the copy operation.

                
                

                - **Lifecycle** *(dict) --* 

                  Specifies the time period, in days, before a recovery point transitions to cold storage or is deleted.

                   

                  Backups transitioned to cold storage must be stored in cold storage for a minimum of 90 days. Therefore, on the console, the retention setting must be 90 days greater than the transition to cold after days setting. The transition to cold after days setting can't be changed after a backup has been transitioned to cold.

                   

                  Resource types that can transition to cold storage are listed in the `Feature availability by resource <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/backup-feature-availability.html#features-by-resource>`__ table. Backup ignores this expression for other resource types.

                   

                  To remove the existing lifecycle and retention periods and keep your recovery points indefinitely, specify -1 for ``MoveToColdStorageAfterDays`` and ``DeleteAfterDays``.

                  
                  

                  - **MoveToColdStorageAfterDays** *(integer) --* 

                    The number of days after creation that a recovery point is moved to cold storage.

                    
                  

                  - **DeleteAfterDays** *(integer) --* 

                    The number of days after creation that a recovery point is deleted. This value must be at least 90 days after the number of days specified in ``MoveToColdStorageAfterDays``.

                    
                  

                  - **OptInToArchiveForSupportedResources** *(boolean) --* 

                    If the value is true, your backup plan transitions supported resources to archive (cold) storage tier in accordance with your lifecycle settings.

                    
                  

                  - **DeleteAfterEvent** *(string) --* 

                    The event after which a recovery point is deleted. A recovery point with both ``DeleteAfterDays`` and ``DeleteAfterEvent`` will delete after whichever condition is satisfied first. Not valid as an input.

                    
              
                

                - **DestinationBackupVaultArn** *(string) --* 

                  An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies the destination backup vault for the copied backup. For example, ``arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:backup-vault:aBackupVault``.

                  
            
          
            

            - **EnableContinuousBackup** *(boolean) --* 

              Specifies whether Backup creates continuous backups. True causes Backup to create continuous backups capable of point-in-time restore (PITR). False (or not specified) causes Backup to create snapshot backups.

              
            

            - **ScheduleExpressionTimezone** *(string) --*

              Specifies the backup option for a selected resource. This option is available for Windows VSS backup jobs and S3 backups.

               

              Valid values:

               

              Set to ``"WindowsVSS":"enabled"`` to enable the ``WindowsVSS`` backup option and create a Windows VSS backup.

               

              Set to ``"WindowsVSS":"disabled"`` to create a regular backup. The ``WindowsVSS`` option is not enabled by default.

               

              For S3 backups, set to ``"S3BackupACLs":"disabled"`` to exclude ACLs from the backup, or ``"S3BackupObjectTags":"disabled"`` to exclude object tags from the backup. By default, both ACLs and object tags are included in S3 backups.

               

              If you specify an invalid option, you get an ``InvalidParameterValueException`` exception.
