    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **RecoveryPointArn** *(string) --* 

        An ARN that uniquely identifies a recovery point; for example, ``arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:recovery-point:1EB3B5E7-9EB0-435A-A80B-108B488B0D45``.

        
      

      - **BackupVaultName** *(string) --* 

        The name of a logical container where backups are stored. Backup vaults are identified by names that are unique to the account used to create them and the Region where they are created.

        Contains identifying information about the creation of a recovery point, including the ``BackupPlanArn``, ``BackupPlanId``, ``BackupPlanVersion``, and ``BackupRuleId`` of the backup plan used to create it.

        
        

        - **BackupPlanId** *(string) --* 

          Uniquely identifies a backup plan.

          
        

        - **BackupPlanArn** *(string) --* 

          An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies a backup plan; for example, ``arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:plan:8F81F553-3A74-4A3F-B93D-B3360DC80C50``.

          
        

        - **BackupPlanName** *(string) --* 

          The name of the backup plan that created this recovery point. This provides human-readable context about which backup plan was responsible for the backup job.

          
        

        - **BackupPlanVersion** *(string) --* 

          Version IDs are unique, randomly generated, Unicode, UTF-8 encoded strings that are at most 1,024 bytes long. They cannot be edited.

          
        

        - **BackupRuleId** *(string) --* 

          Uniquely identifies a rule used to schedule the backup of a selection of resources.

          
        

        - **BackupRuleName** *(string) --* 

          The name of the backup rule within the backup plan that created this recovery point. This helps identify which specific rule triggered the backup job.

          
        

        - **BackupRuleCron** *(string) --* 

          The cron expression that defines the schedule for the backup rule. This shows the frequency and timing of when backups are automatically triggered.

          
        

        - **BackupRuleTimezone** *(string) --* 

          The timezone used for the backup rule schedule. This provides context for when backups are scheduled to run in the specified timezone.

          
    
      

      - **IamRoleArn** *(string) --* 

        Specifies the IAM role ARN used to create the target recovery point; for example, ``arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/S3Access``.

        
      

      - **Status** *(string) --* 

        A status code specifying the state of the recovery point. For more information, see `Recovery point status <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/applicationstackbackups.html#cfnrecoverypointstatus>`__ in the *Backup Developer Guide*.

         

        
        * ``CREATING`` status indicates that an Backup job has been initiated for a resource. The backup process has started and is actively processing a backup job for the associated recovery point.
         
        * ``AVAILABLE`` status indicates that the backup was successfully created for the recovery point. The backup process has completed without any issues, and the recovery point is now ready for use.
         
        * ``PARTIAL`` status indicates a composite recovery point has one or more nested recovery points that were not in the backup.
         
        * ``EXPIRED`` status indicates that the recovery point has exceeded its retention period, but Backup lacks permission or is otherwise unable to delete it. To manually delete these recovery points, see `Step 3\: Delete the recovery points <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/gs-cleanup-resources.html#cleanup-backups>`__ in the *Clean up resources* section of *Getting started*.
         
        * ``STOPPED`` status occurs on a continuous backup where a user has taken some action that causes the continuous backup to be disabled. This can be caused by the removal of permissions, turning off versioning, turning off events being sent to EventBridge, or disabling the EventBridge rules that are put in place by Backup. For recovery points of Amazon S3, Amazon RDS, and Amazon Aurora resources, this status occurs when the retention period of a continuous backup rule is changed. To resolve ``STOPPED`` status, ensure that all requested permissions are in place and that versioning is enabled on the S3 bucket. Once these conditions are met, the next instance of a backup rule running will result in a new continuous recovery point being created. The recovery points with STOPPED status do not need to be deleted. For SAP HANA on Amazon EC2 ``STOPPED`` status occurs due to user action, application misconfiguration, or backup failure. To ensure that future continuous backups succeed, refer to the recovery point status and check SAP HANA for details.
        

        
      

      - **StatusMessage** *(string) --* 

        A status message explaining the status of the recovery point.

        
      

      - **CreationDate** *(datetime) --* 

        The date and time that a recovery point is created, in Unix format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of ``CreationDate`` is accurate to milliseconds. For example, the value 1516925490.087 represents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.

        
      

      - **InitiationDate** *(datetime) --* 

        The date and time when the backup job that created this recovery point was initiated, in Unix format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

        
      

      - **CompletionDate** *(datetime) --* 

        The date and time that a job to create a recovery point is completed, in Unix format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of ``CompletionDate`` is accurate to milliseconds.

      - **BackupSizeInBytes** *(integer) --* 

        The size, in bytes, of a backup.

        
      

      - **CalculatedLifecycle** *(dict) --* 

        A ``CalculatedLifecycle`` object containing ``DeleteAt`` and ``MoveToColdStorageAt`` timestamps.

        
        

        - **MoveToColdStorageAt** *(datetime) --* 

          A timestamp that specifies when to transition a recovery point to cold storage.

          A timestamp that specifies when to delete a recovery point.

          
    
      

      - **Lifecycle** *(dict) --* 

        The lifecycle defines when a protected resource is transitioned to cold storage and when it expires. Backup transitions and expires backups automatically according to the lifecycle that you define.

         

        Backups that are transitioned to cold storage must be stored in cold storage for a minimum of 90 days. Therefore, the “retention” setting must be 90 days greater than the “transition to cold after days” setting. The “transition to cold after days” setting cannot be changed after a backup has been transitioned to cold.

         

        Resource types that can transition to cold storage are listed in the `Feature availability by resource <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/backup-feature-availability.html#features-by-resource>`__ table. Backup ignores this expression for other resource types.

        
        

        - **MoveToColdStorageAfterDays** *(integer) --* 

          The number of days after creation that a recovery point is moved to cold storage.

          
        

        - **DeleteAfterDays** *(integer) --* 

          The number of days after creation that a recovery point is deleted. This value must be at least 90 days after the number of days specified in ``MoveToColdStorageAfterDays``.

          
        

        - **OptInToArchiveForSupportedResources** *(boolean) --* 

          If the value is true, your backup plan transitions supported resources to archive (cold) storage tier in accordance with your lifecycle settings.

          
        

        - **DeleteAfterEvent** *(string) --* 

          The event after which a recovery point is deleted. A recovery point with both ``DeleteAfterDays`` and ``DeleteAfterEvent`` will delete after whichever condition is satisfied first. Not valid as an input.

          
    
      

      - **EncryptionKeyArn** *(string) --* 

        The server-side encryption key used to protect your backups; for example, ``arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab``.

      - **CompositeMemberIdentifier** *(string) --* 

        The identifier of a resource within a composite group, such as nested (child) recovery point belonging to a composite (parent) stack. The ID is transferred from the `logical ID <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/resources-section-structure.html#resources-section-structure-syntax>`__ within a stack.
