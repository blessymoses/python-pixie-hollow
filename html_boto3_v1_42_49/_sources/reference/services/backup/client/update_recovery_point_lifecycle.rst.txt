*******************************



.. py:method:: Backup.Client.update_recovery_point_lifecycle(**kwargs)

  

  Sets the transition lifecycle of a recovery point.

   

  The lifecycle defines when a protected resource is transitioned to cold storage and when it expires. Backup transitions and expires backups automatically according to the lifecycle that you define.

   

  Resource types that can transition to cold storage are listed in the `Feature availability by resource <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/backup-feature-availability.html#features-by-resource>`__ table. Backup ignores this expression for other resource types.

   

  Backups transitioned to cold storage must be stored in cold storage for a minimum of 90 days. Therefore, the “retention” setting must be 90 days greater than the “transition to cold after days” setting. The “transition to cold after days” setting cannot be changed after a backup has been transitioned to cold.

   

  .. warning::

     

    If your lifecycle currently uses the parameters ``DeleteAfterDays`` and ``MoveToColdStorageAfterDays``, include these parameters and their values when you call this operation. Not including them may result in your plan updating with null values.

     

   

  This operation does not support continuous backups.

  ::

    response = client.update_recovery_point_lifecycle(
        BackupVaultName='string',
        RecoveryPointArn='string',
        Lifecycle={
            'MoveToColdStorageAfterDays': 123,

        }
    )
    
  :type BackupVaultName: string
  :param BackupVaultName: **[REQUIRED]** 

    The name of a logical container where backups are stored. Backup vaults are identified by names that are unique to the account used to create them and the Amazon Web Services Region where they are created.

    

  
  :type RecoveryPointArn: string
  :param RecoveryPointArn: **[REQUIRED]** 

    An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies a recovery point; for example, ``arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:recovery-point:1EB3B5E7-9EB0-435A-A80B-108B488B0D45``.

    

  
  :type Lifecycle: dict
  :param Lifecycle: 

    The lifecycle defines when a protected resource is transitioned to cold storage and when it expires. Backup transitions and expires backups automatically according to the lifecycle that you define.

     

    Backups transitioned to cold storage must be stored in cold storage for a minimum of 90 days. Therefore, the “retention” setting must be 90 days greater than the “transition to cold after days” setting. The “transition to cold after days” setting cannot be changed after a backup has been transitioned to cold.

    

  
    - **MoveToColdStorageAfterDays** *(integer) --* 

      The number of days after creation that a recovery point is moved to cold storage.

      

    
    - **DeleteAfterDays** *(integer) --* 

      The number of days after creation that a recovery point is deleted. This value must be at least 90 days after the number of days specified in ``MoveToColdStorageAfterDays``.

      

    
    - **OptInToArchiveForSupportedResources** *(boolean) --* 

      If the value is true, your backup plan transitions supported resources to archive (cold) storage tier in accordance with your lifecycle settings.

      

    
    - **DeleteAfterEvent** *(string) --* 

      The event after which a recovery point is deleted. A recovery point with both ``DeleteAfterDays`` and ``DeleteAfterEvent`` will delete after whichever condition is satisfied first. Not valid as an input.
