  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_indexed_recovery_points(
        NextToken='string',
        MaxResults=123,
        SourceResourceArn='string',
        CreatedBefore=datetime(2015, 1, 1),
        CreatedAfter=datetime(2015, 1, 1),
        ResourceType='string',
        IndexStatus='PENDING'|'ACTIVE'|'FAILED'|'DELETING'
    )
    
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    The next item following a partial list of returned recovery points.

     

    For example, if a request is made to return ``MaxResults`` number of indexed recovery points, ``NextToken`` allows you to return more items in your list starting at the location pointed to by the next token.

    

  
  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    The maximum number of resource list items to be returned.

    

  
  :type SourceResourceArn: string
  :param SourceResourceArn: 

    A string of the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies the source resource.

    

  
  :type CreatedBefore: datetime
  :param CreatedBefore: 

    Returns only indexed recovery points that were created before the specified date.

    

  
  :type CreatedAfter: datetime
  :param CreatedAfter: 

    Returns only indexed recovery points that were created after the specified date.

    

  
  :type ResourceType: string
  :param ResourceType: 

    Returns a list of indexed recovery points for the specified resource type(s).

     

    Accepted values include:

     

    
    * ``EBS`` for Amazon Elastic Block Store
     
    * ``S3`` for Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)
    

    

  
  :type IndexStatus: string
  :param IndexStatus: 

    Include this parameter to filter the returned list by the indicated statuses.

     

    Accepted values: ``PENDING`` | ``ACTIVE`` | ``FAILED`` | ``DELETING``

     

    A recovery point with an index that has the status of ``ACTIVE`` can be included in a search.
