  **Request Syntax**
  ::

    response = client.list_backup_job_summaries(
        AccountId='string',
        State='CREATED'|'PENDING'|'RUNNING'|'ABORTING'|'ABORTED'|'COMPLETED'|'FAILED'|'EXPIRED'|'PARTIAL'|'AGGREGATE_ALL'|'ANY',
        ResourceType='string',
        MessageCategory='string',
        AggregationPeriod='ONE_DAY'|'SEVEN_DAYS'|'FOURTEEN_DAYS',
        MaxResults=123,
        NextToken='string'
    )
    
  :type AccountId: string
  :param AccountId: 

    Returns the job count for the specified account.

     

    If the request is sent from a member account or an account not part of Amazon Web Services Organizations, jobs within requestor's account will be returned.

     

    Root, admin, and delegated administrator accounts can use the value ANY to return job counts from every account in the organization.

     

    ``AGGREGATE_ALL`` aggregates job counts from all accounts within the authenticated organization, then returns the sum.

    

  
  :type State: string
  :param State: 

    This parameter returns the job count for jobs with the specified state.

     

    The the value ANY returns count of all states.

     

    ``AGGREGATE_ALL`` aggregates job counts for all states and returns the sum.

     

    ``Completed with issues`` is a status found only in the Backup console. For API, this status refers to jobs with a state of ``COMPLETED`` and a ``MessageCategory`` with a value other than ``SUCCESS``; that is, the status is completed but comes with a status message. To obtain the job count for ``Completed with issues``, run two GET requests, and subtract the second, smaller number:

     

    GET /audit/backup-job-summaries?AggregationPeriod=FOURTEEN_DAYS&State=COMPLETED

     

    GET /audit/backup-job-summaries?AggregationPeriod=FOURTEEN_DAYS&MessageCategory=SUCCESS&State=COMPLETED

    

  
  :type ResourceType: string
  :param ResourceType: 

    Returns the job count for the specified resource type. Use request ``GetSupportedResourceTypes`` to obtain strings for supported resource types.

     

    The the value ANY returns count of all resource types.

     

    ``AGGREGATE_ALL`` aggregates job counts for all resource types and returns the sum.

     

    The type of Amazon Web Services resource to be backed up; for example, an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume or an Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) database.

    

  
  :type MessageCategory: string
  :param MessageCategory: 

    This parameter returns the job count for the specified message category.

     

    Example accepted strings include ``AccessDenied``, ``Success``, and ``InvalidParameters``. See `Monitoring <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/monitoring.html>`__ for a list of accepted MessageCategory strings.

     

    The the value ANY returns count of all message categories.

     

    ``AGGREGATE_ALL`` aggregates job counts for all message categories and returns the sum.

    

  
  :type AggregationPeriod: string
  :param AggregationPeriod: 

    The period for the returned results.

     

    
    * ``ONE_DAY`` - The daily job count for the prior 14 days.
     
    * ``SEVEN_DAYS`` - The aggregated job count for the prior 7 days.
     
    * ``FOURTEEN_DAYS`` - The aggregated job count for prior 14 days.
    

    

  
  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    The maximum number of items to be returned.

     

    The value is an integer. Range of accepted values is from 1 to 500.

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    The next item following a partial list of returned resources. For example, if a request is made to return ``MaxResults`` number of resources, ``NextToken`` allows you to return more items in your list starting at the location pointed to by the next token.
