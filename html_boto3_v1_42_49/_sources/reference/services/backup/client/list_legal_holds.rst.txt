    **Response Structure**

    

    - *(dict) --* 
      

      - **NextToken** *(string) --* 

        The next item following a partial list of returned resources. For example, if a request is made to return ``MaxResults`` number of resources, ``NextToken`` allows you to return more items in your list starting at the location pointed to by the next token.

        
      

      - **LegalHolds** *(list) --* 

        This is an array of returned legal holds, both active and previous.

        
        

        - *(dict) --* 

          A legal hold is an administrative tool that helps prevent backups from being deleted while under a hold. While the hold is in place, backups under a hold cannot be deleted and lifecycle policies that would alter the backup status (such as transition to cold storage) are delayed until the legal hold is removed. A backup can have more than one legal hold. Legal holds are applied to one or more backups (also known as recovery points). These backups can be filtered by resource types and by resource IDs.

          
          

          - **Title** *(string) --* 

            The title of a legal hold.

            
          

          - **Status** *(string) --*

            The ID of the legal hold.

            
          

          - **LegalHoldArn** *(string) --* 

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the legal hold; for example, ``arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:recovery-point:1EB3B5E7-9EB0-435A-A80B-108B488B0D45``.
