        NextToken='string'
    )
    
  :type AccountId: string
  :param AccountId: 

    Returns the job count for the specified account.

     

    If the request is sent from a member account or an account not part of Amazon Web Services Organizations, jobs within requestor's account will be returned.

     

    Root, admin, and delegated administrator accounts can use the value ``ANY`` to return job counts from every account in the organization.

  :type ResourceType: string
  :param ResourceType: 

    Returns the job count for the specified resource type. Use request ``GetSupportedResourceTypes`` to obtain strings for supported resource types.

    ``AGGREGATE_ALL`` aggregates job counts for all resource types and returns the sum.

    

  
  :type MalwareScanner: string
  :param MalwareScanner: 

    Returns only the scan jobs for the specified malware scanner. Currently the only MalwareScanner is ``GUARDDUTY``. But the field also supports ``ANY``, and ``AGGREGATE_ALL``.

    

  
  :type ScanResultStatus: string
  :param ScanResultStatus: 

    Returns only the scan jobs for the specified scan results.

    

  
  :type State: string
  :param State: 

    Returns only the scan jobs for the specified scanning job state.

    

  
  :type AggregationPeriod: string
  :param AggregationPeriod: 

    The period for the returned results.

     

    
    * ``ONE_DAY``The daily job count for the prior 1 day.
     
    * ``SEVEN_DAYS``The daily job count for the prior 7 days.
     
    * ``FOURTEEN_DAYS``The daily job count for the prior 14 days.
    

    

  
  :type MaxResults: integer
  :param MaxResults: 

    The maximum number of items to be returned.

     

    The value is an integer. Range of accepted values is from 1 to 500.

    

  
  :type NextToken: string
  :param NextToken: 

    The next item following a partial list of returned items. For example, if a request is made to return ``MaxResults`` number of items, ``NextToken`` allows you to return more items in your list starting at the location pointed to by the next token.
